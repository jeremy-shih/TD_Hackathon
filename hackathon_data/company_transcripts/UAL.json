My name is Brandon and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. Following the initial remarks from management, we will open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed, or rebroadcast without the company\u2019s permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.","I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Julie Stewart, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Julie Yates Stewart","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information on yesterday\u2019s release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company\u2019s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor updates, copies of which are available on our website.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Julie, and welcome to the United family. Pleased to have you here and thank you all for joining us on our call this morning. Our fourth quarter financial and operating performance capped what we think is an outstanding year for our airline.","In 2016, we we put into action our plan to become the best airline in the world and last year\u2019s results demonstrate we\u2019re well on our way to achieving that goal. We plan to continue delivering on this commitment by investing in employees, elevating our customer experience and driving strong and consistent returns for our shareholders.","If you turn to Slide 4, let\u2019s review the year. We reported pre-tax earnings of $4.5 billion with a pre-tax margin of 12.2%, both excluding special items. For the year, we earned $8.65 per share, a 13% increase over 2015, adjusting for book taxes as a result of $2.6 billion of share repurchases in the year.","Before going into greater detail on the financial results, I want to review key accomplishments in the year, which was a year of transmission for us here at United. Notably, we ratified new industry-leading labor agreements for all United employee groups, starting a new chapter in how we build a partnership between management and labor while driving higher employee engagement.","We also continue to build upon an industry-leading leadership team, a critical step forward in our progress as an agile and innovative leader in the industry. We delivered significant improvements operationally, substantially increasing our reliability and customer satisfaction, as well as achieving the best on-time performance in our history and delivering the most zero cancelation days ever.","We opened several new international routes to key growing markets, introduced the new United Polaris service, the biggest product innovation for us in more than a decade. And importantly, we outlined the future direction of our company at our November Investor Day, laying out a longer-term plan for earnings growth through a number of strategic initiatives across the airline that we expect to generate significant improvements by the year 2020.","I couldn\u2019t go on without personally thanking all of our employees for their hard work and commitment in achieving these milestones. More recently, I\u2019d like to extend my gratitude for the great work that was done during the busy holiday season. And so with a shared purpose comes shared success, and of course, with that success comes a shared benefit. So I\u2019m pleased to announce that due to our strong financial performance, United employees will be able to share in the success as we payout $628 million in profit-sharing for the year. Above all, I believe we\u2019ve begun to change the conversation about United from the question what\u2019s wrong to an optimistic what\u2019s next and that has been the most powerful change of all.","With that, let me turn over to our President, Scott Kirby.","Scott Kirby","Thank you, Oscar. I\u2019d like to start by thanking our employees for their hard work over a busy holiday season. In 2016, the United team delivered new all-time records for departure performance, arrival performance, completion factor and baggage handling. Over the holidays, we also set new all-time records for essentially all of our operating metrics and the people of United played a critical role in connecting family and friends during the holidays. In order to continue improving operational performance in 2017, our top focus will be on further improvements in completion factor and departure performance.","Turning to revenue, our consolidated PRASM declined 1.6% for the quarter. We outperformed our guidance as we went through the quarter, given stronger than expected business traffic in December. If we\u2019re going to miss our guidance range, we certainly prefer to miss like this on the upside. In our view, both the demand and the pricing environment got meaningfully better post-election and that strong demand trend, particularly for business travel continued through the fourth quarter and on into the first quarter.","Looking forward, we anticipate first quarter consolidated PRASM to be flat at the midpoint of our guidance range, marking the fourth straight quarter of second derivative improvement. We saw strong within-quarter growth in the Atlantic, Latin, and domestic regions. The only region that didn\u2019t outperform our original expectations was the Pacific driven by significant capacity growth from both the industry and United.","During the first quarter, we\u2019re currently forecasting flat to up domestic unit revenue growth. We expect the Atlantic and Pacific roughly similar year-over-year first quarter PRASM as we saw in the fourth quarter. We expect Latin PRASM to be up, but currently expected to be slightly less than what was in the fourth quarter based on the Easter shift and the fact that our Latin comps get a little harder in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our 2017 capacity outlook, we expect our first quarter capacity growth to be up 1% to 2% consistent with our full-year 2017 capacity guidance provided at Investor Day. As shown in Slide 9, we expect that growth to be biased towards higher domestic growth.","On Slide 10, we have provided a brief update on some of our near-term commercial initiatives. We\u2019re working on the network changes and expect to begin implementing changes in Chicago, Houston, and New York later this year. We\u2019re excited to be rolling out later \u2013 Basic Economy later this quarter for travel beginning in the second quarter and our new Polaris product has been a hit with customers and we\u2019re excited and anxious to continue the Polaris rollout as quickly as we can.","And finally, we continue to work hard on the revenue management system. In conclusion, it sure feels like the revenue environment turned the corner in the first \u2013 in the fourth quarter and assuming that continues, we are looking forward to positive PRASM for 2017.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew to go over the financial results.","Andrew Levy","Thanks, Scott. Yesterday afternoon, we released our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings, as well as our first quarter Investor Update. I\u2019ll discuss both our results and outlook today at a high level, but please refer to those documents for additional detail.","Slide 12 shows a summary of our GAAP financials, and Slide 13 has non-GAAP or our economic results. In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.78, up 8.5% year-over-year on a tax-adjusted basis.","For the full-year, we earned $8.65 per share, which is a 13% increase year-over-year again on a tax-adjusted basis. Excluding special items, we generated $4.5 billion of pre-tax income, basically flat compared with 2015, and a 12.2% margin, which was slightly higher than the 11.9% margin reported in 2015.","Slide 14 details our cost performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. While labor rate increases created upward cost pressure. We did a very good job managing the rest of our cost to a flat core CASM growth, which exceeded our initial internal expectations.","Turning to our 2017 cost outlook on Slide 15, we expect our first quarter non-fuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit-sharing, and third-party expenses to increase between 4.5% and 5.5%, with 4 points of this growth due to the ratified labor agreements for 2016.","Our 2017 full-year guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% non-fuel unit cost growth is unchanged. We expect core cost growth to be less than 1% in 2017 by meeting the cost savings targets, as highlighted at our Investor Day.","Based on guidance, we\u2019ve provided for costs and revenues in the first quarter of 2017, we expect our pre-tax margin, excluding special items to be between 1.5% and 2.5%. Please note, our first quarter is historically our weakest quarter of the year, which is due to the structure of our route network.","In addition, this year\u2019s first quarter is even tougher, as it will be a high watermark in terms of non-fuel unit cost growth due to the timing of labor rate increases and the pressure we\u2019re seeing from materially higher fuel costs.","Turning to Slide 16, we ended 2016 with $5.8 billion of unrestricted cash, including our $1.35 billion revolver, which remains untapped. As of the end of the year, our gross debt balance, including capitalized operating leases was $16.5 billion, about $600 million less than at the end of 2015. In 2016, we generated $5.5 billion of operating cash flow and $2.2 billion of free cash flow. Maintaining a strong balance sheet remains the top strategic priority.","During 2016, we invested $2.6 billion to repurchase 15 million shares at an average price of approximately $52 per share. In the fourth quarter, we invested $156 million, repurchasing our shares at an average of $59 per share. Since the beginning of our share repurchase program in 2014, we\u2019ve invested over $4 billion, purchasing approximately 80 million shares, which has reduced our outstanding shares by approximately 20%. We currently have just over $1.8 billion remaining of repurchase authority and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders.","With respect to CapEx, we\u2019re reiterating our 2017 guidance to capital expenditures of between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion from non-aircraft CapEx. Please note our aircraft CapEx is elevated this year as we have 15 widebody deliveries scheduled. We have secured financing for all, but a few mainline aircraft deliveries in 2017 through the two EETC transactions we concluded last year and are currently exploring options to finance the 24 Embraer 175 aircraft, which will deliver during this year.","Regarding our fleet, we maintain flexibility and are further exploring, both our widebody and narrowbody fleets and order book plans. Last week, we announced our plans to move up by one year the retirement of our 747 fleet. This decision was mostly driven by our desire to simplify our operations where possible and enhance fleet and operational reliability. We will now retire all 20 remaining 747s by year-end, but there\u2019s no change to capacity or CapEx, as a result of the earlier retirement timeline.","Our 14 new 777-300ERs, two of which we accepted in December of 2016 and the remaining, which will come in the first-half of 2017 will essentially backfill the 747 capacity and routes. As we refine our fleet needs and explore how best to achieve them, we\u2019re actively seeking opportunities in the used aircraft market. Our fleet review is a work in progress and we will update you later this year when we have something to share.","In conclusion, 2016 was a very good year for United as seen in our financial metrics. Moving to 2017, we have challenges in the resetting of our labor agreements, as well as higher fuel costs. However, as we believe, we have great opportunities as outlined at our Investor Day and we look forward to beginning to execute on those plans.","I\u2019ll now turn it back to Oscar for closing remarks.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Andrew. Let me just close by saying, we\u2019re excited about 2017. We have the strategy and certainly the structure in place to deliver on all our commitments to not only employees and customers, but to you as investors as well.","So with that, let\u2019s turn it over to Julie and we\u2019ll get to Q&A.","Julie Yates Stewart","Thank you, Oscar. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from media. But please limit yourself to one question and as need one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Julie, and the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hey, good morning. Thank you. Scott, is the share system giving you the tools that you need to execute the vision for United in both the immediate term and the long-term? And is it a permanent solution for United, or is an RFP for a new PSS inevitable at some point in the next one to three years?","Scott Kirby","Shares is a good fundamental foundation and architecture. We can make it a lot better for our people by putting a better front-end on it. But it is our reservation system. It\u2019s not limiting anything we do from a revenue perspective or anything like that. It\u2019s just sometimes a little clunkier to use for our people than some \u2013 than perhaps we can make it. We have a number of systems where our IT team now that they\u2019re through the integration work is hard at work on actually making the interfaces easier for people to use. But you shouldn\u2019t expect us to be changing shares and it\u2019s not a limiting factor for us at all.","Hunter Keay","Great. Thank you. And then also for you, Scott, as you forge ahead with sort of a top to bottom review of how things are done at United, how are you thinking about, again, this is a near-term and long-term question about the business relationship that you guys have with your GDS providers? And the specific question is, do you envision a scenario at some point in the next couple of years, where you continue to disaggregate your services and maybe push towards a partial content agreement with, at least, one major GDS provider? Is that something that you would really highly value in the medium-term as something you think you can get? Thanks.","Scott Kirby","I\u2019m not a 100% sure how the situation will evolve. There\u2019s the potential for GDSes to be partners, that has to be a balanced relationship if they\u2019re going to be partners. It historically hasn\u2019t been what I would describe as a partnership, it\u2019s been a lot more one way. We do have more and more customers coming directly to us. But we recognize that there are some things that some of our customers like to use the GDS for.","In an ideal world, we\u2019d get to a balanced relationship, where the GDSes were fairly compensated for what they add, but that it was fairly compensated and the customers actually had the choice of whether to go direct or whether to use the GDS. I think it\u2019s also incredibly important. One of the big things that we\u2019re going to be pushing on in the near-term is to get adequate disclosure to our customers when they buy through GDS.","So we\u2019re going to be rolling out Basic Economy later this quarter and starting travel in the second quarter. To me, the most important thing that we\u2019re going to need to do on that is communicate to our customers. And I assure you, on united.com, we\u2019re going to have a very clear communications about what the rules and restrictions are. And I think it\u2019s going to be really hard to go through and buy on united.com and not know exactly what the rules and restrictions are.","We want all of our other entities that sell United tickets to do the same thing. And we want customers to know for sure what they\u2019re buying and the GDSes can play an important role in that, hasn\u2019t historically been the top of their investment list, but we need them to do that. And if we can create a relationship, where they\u2019re effectively communicating that and we have a cost structure that is fair and balanced, I think we can continue to evolve on the path that we\u2019re on, but and actually that with those caveats.","Oscar Munoz","And this is Oscar, I\u2019d just add on, over the course of the year, this conversation has been going on with many other partners in our distribution process with regards to how we want to move forward together with the emphasis on together and with the end customer in mind as well. And so you will see some evolution and changes going forward, but again all with an open amicable conversational sort of tone as we move forward in our partnership.","Hunter Keay","That\u2019s great. Helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Scott, you\u2019ve called out the Easter impact, I think when you were talking about LatAm PRASM.","Scott Kirby","Yes.","Michael Linenberg","What is it across the system? What is the impact on a network basis? How should we think about that the way Easter falls this year?","Scott Kirby","I think we\u2019d say that the Easter impact is probably about \u2013 for the quarter about 30 basis points negative. My guess is, it\u2019s going to be 40 basis points positive for the second quarter, something like that. Having Easter fall on April hurts the first quarter revenue a little bit, but helps the second quarter more. The impact is bigger \u2013 that impact is a bigger shift for Latin than for the other entities, domestic is also reasonably big. But it\u2019s not a huge issue either way.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, very good. And then just with respect to the moves in FX, what was that impact on the Pacific in the fourth quarter? Do you have that? And how does that potentially change in the March quarter, because we\u2019ve seen a lot of Pacific currencies go the wrong way, where I feel like\u2026","Scott Kirby","Yes.","Michael Linenberg","\u2026some of the Latin currencies have gone the right way over the last four or five months?","Scott Kirby","So I don\u2019t have a perfect \u2013 a really good number for you here. But I think it was about a 1.5 point negative impact in the fourth quarter, and I don\u2019t have a number for what the first quarter would be. But obviously, the stronger dollar is going to be the negative and that\u2019s been bigger in the Pacific than other regions.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess this is for Oscar or Scott. Can you just give us an idea of line of sight on margin improvement, because I think the volatility is obviously hurting investor views of airline stocks right now? So obviously with fuel down the last two \u2013 couple of years, you\u2019ve had very high margins. We know the resets in the labor contracts. But can you talk about your expectations for the interactions on some of these operational improvements and revenue and commercial improvements in the system and when you think you can get back to those levels of profitability?","Oscar Munoz","Hey, Brandon, this is Oscar. I\u2019ll just kick it off real quickly and probably hand it over to Andrew to just quickly recap and remind what we talked about at our Investor Day that we have more than several initiatives with regards to our margin improvement and the aspiration again to be leading in that space by the year 2020. So Scott, Andrew, maybe you can just remind him of a couple of the items that we\u2019re working through?","Andrew Levy","Yes, I mean, I think you mentioned a couple of specific items, including operational integrity and the benefits thereof. And I think that everything, as Oscar mentioned, were pushing down the path that we outlined at Investor Day, and we\u2019re making progress and doing what we said we\u2019d do. Obviously, a lot of these are longer lead time items. And we\u2019re kind of at the very beginning stages of beginning to execute on them and we expect to see a lot of positives that come from that.","Oscar Munoz","Yes, broader conversation that will ensue, I think as we discussed as a team is, someone like me coming from the outside with regards to PRASM and CASM and the focus on that at various times. I have to say the last time I checked businesses run on, at the end of the day margins and that\u2019s something we\u2019re really focused on. So hopefully, that gives you a little clarity or at least support in that, that\u2019s kind of our focus on improving margin. Thanks, Brandon.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, thank you.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Savanthi Syth online. Please go ahead.","Savanthi Syth","Hey, good morning. Just on the Pacific, another question. I understand that FX is an unknown headwind, but I was wondering what your expectations are for the performance in that entity as we go through this year, when we might see some of those supply issues kind of moderate and maybe might get to positive PRASM there?","Scott Kirby","So, you\u2019re right. I think the supply issues are bigger than the current issues. And supply gets better in the \u2013 a little bit better in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter and then second quarter gets better again and we expect the third and fourth quarters to get better.","So the first-half of the year is going to have a lot of supply pressure. But the bilaterals, the amount of flying available, at least, from Beijing and Shanghai to the U.S. from China is \u2013 and the China bilateral is done, is filled by the time we get to the first-half of the year.","So our expectation is that things will start to improve all else equal in the second-half. I don\u2019t know for sure we\u2019ll turn to positive PRASM, but certainly the second derivative will \u2013 should be a positive \u2013 should be positive just from a supply perspective moving forward.","Savanthi Syth","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And if I \u2013 along those same lines on the Atlantic side, I know much has been said about ULCCs. But it seems like and maybe one of your partners, Air Canada, is adding a lot of or has a lot of goals for the Transatlantic and wanting to be kind of a connecting hub and is adding a lot of capacity. Is that \u2013 at what \u2013 I mean, is that an issue and at what point do you need to respond to that?","Scott Kirby","I think I\u2019m going to not be able to answer that question very directly, because we compete with across the board. We need to be competitive with everyone. Sometimes those airlines need to be competitive with our partners, sometimes they\u2019re not. And we are sensitive to anyone, that\u2019s a competitive threat issue for us and we will be aggressive about competing with all of them. But I can\u2019t talk specifically about anything we\u2019re planning to do with regard to Air Canada.","Savanthi Syth","All right. Got it. Well, thank you.","Operator","From Bernstein, we have David Vernon. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Andrew, I guess, I was wondering if you could provide a little commentary around where you\u2019re expecting free cash flow to end up this year relative to the $2.2 billion last year and how much of the buyback you think you can get done in 2017?","Andrew Levy","Well, we provided you a CapEx estimate for this year, but we\u2019re not going to provide you with a full-year earnings target. So I\u2019m not sure, I can really answer that question. As far as repurchase of shares, as I mentioned, we\u2019re committed to returning excess cash to shareholders.","We\u2019re certainly not going to kind of telegraph how we\u2019re going to do that as far as the pace or the price or anything of that nature. But we do remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. We have $1.8 billion of authority remaining and we expect to execute all that. I don\u2019t know if it will all be in 2017 or not, I think it just depends on a variety of factors.","David Vernon","Would you be willing to supplement some of the free cash from operations with a little more leverage, or are you comfortable with where the balance sheet is right now?","Andrew Levy","We\u2019re very comfortable with where the balance sheet is in general. I wouldn\u2019t close the door out on being opportunistic in the debt market. We\u2019re always going to remain opportunistic. But we think that our balance sheet is very good. It has improved a great deal. We\u2019re very happy where it is. And I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any significant changes to the composition of the capital structure.","David Vernon","Okay. And then maybe just one last one on the retirement of the 747s. Are you expecting any sort of meaningful cost tailwind from that as you kind of close out that fleet type in 2018, or any sort of write-down that would follow that, or is it going to be kind of more normal course and folded into normal cost inflation?","Andrew Levy","No, there\u2019s not going to be any incremental write-down expense, at least, I mean very small perhaps. But for the most part, we\u2019ve already accelerated depreciation of that asset, and so the change from this year to next year is pretty immaterial.","As far as tailwinds, look, I think that modern equipment is far more efficient and that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re making the decision we\u2019re making is not only for efficiency, but also the operational reliability, which has an effect on both revenue and cost that should be positive by retiring those aircraft and replacing them with modern equipment.","So I think you\u2019re right that\u2019s probably a 2018 benefit that we\u2019ll see as we continue to fly these aircraft through the third, or I guess, through the third quarter, end of the fourth quarter this year.","David Vernon","Excellent. Thanks a lot for your time, guys.","Andrew Levy","Thanks.","Oscar Munoz","Before we go to the next one, I just want to provide some additional color, I guess, with regards to part of David\u2019s question with regards to sort of forecast or guidance. At United, we\u2019re focused on transparency. Guidance in itself will take many forms and it will serve a purpose for us, bare with us as we sort of come together on the things that we think are important for you to understand and know about us, we\u2019ll provide those.","In the areas that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s as critical, we will not provide that guidance. Just from a standpoint, I think, as Andrew said, we want to be opportunistic in certain things like repurchases. But also we want to make sure that we\u2019re running the best possible business at all times for the value of shareholders and sometimes guidance gets in a way of that. So you know the story. Again transparency is our objective and focus. You are not always going to get the specific guidance that you want. So just a broad statement. Turn it back over to you.","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joe DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes, thanks. Oscar, to that point, I guess and maybe this is a question for Scott or Andrew. Just looking at your Investor Day slides, you\u2019ve got MileagePlus adding about $650 million in EBIT cumulatively by 2018 and that compares to 2015. I would imagine that out of all the initiatives there is probably the most visibility into the credit card. My question is can you tell us what the starting EBIT number was for 2015. How much did MileagePlus contribute to EBIT in 2015?","Scott Kirby","No, we aren\u2019t going to disclose that.","Oscar Munoz","That one is just a no.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Can I ask, I guess, what are the obvious reasons? If you\u2019ve got this segment of the business that\u2019s enormously profitable and you are trying to convince investors that the airline is different and the earnings and cash flow are more sustainable, why not help us understand the aspect of the business that is vastly different now than it was 10 years ago?","Andrew Levy","I think, Joe, this is Andrew. That is something that we\u2019re certainly has been \u2013 something I\u2019ve been talking about since I joined the company. It\u2019s \u2013 MileagePlus is incredibly powerful very valuable. We\u2019re not at this point in time ready to disclose the types of information that you\u2019re looking for, doesn\u2019t mean we may not get there, but we\u2019re not going to get there today on this call. We do agree it\u2019s a real important part of our business and we share your view that it is perhaps underappreciated by investors. So agree in general with your thesis and we\u2019ll see as we move ahead as to how we want to approach that.","Joseph DeNardi","Great. Thank you.","Operator","From Citigroup, we have Kevin Crissey online. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey","Good morning, everybody. Looking at your core unit costs, excluding newly ratified agreements, which is a quasi-new metric, if we look at the things that your costs exclude \u2013 so it excludes fuel, labor deals, third-party business, profit-sharing and special charges, it doesn\u2019t leave that much left.","So if I look at like ownership costs, whether it be rent or depreciation, landing fees, maintenance, distribution and the big category of other, what would you say of that core group of expenses, what is the natural inflation rate and you\u2019ve guided to what your inflation \u2013 unit inflation rate is here?","And what is it that you are doing in those line items to have that core inflation rate be lower than it would be if it were just naturally inflating, because I think like depreciation not having a particularly high inflation rate, aircraft rent maybe less so, landing fees kind of out of your control? What is it in your control within that core unit cost, excluding newly ratified agreements? Thanks.","Andrew Levy","Yes, to comment on the cost ex this that and the other, keep in mind the third-party is a very small number. Profit-sharing, we like to strip out and show it just because it can move fairly materially, so we like to try to highlight that. This year, we\u2019re trying to kind of isolate the labor cost agreements, or the labor agreements and the cost associated with it just because it is a pretty significant cost driver for the year.","So as far as all the remaining cost attributes, I don\u2019t think I give you a natural rate of inflation in total. I just haven\u2019t thought of it that way. We\u2019re going after every single line item that we believe, where we can become more efficient whether it\u2019s maintenance, whether it\u2019s station operations. You\u2019re right landing fees, we don\u2019t control. But to some extent, as you upguage typically that drives a positive effect in terms of profitability although it maybe a little higher on landed weight, certainly airport facilities cost, we\u2019re trying to find ways, we can be more efficient. Distribution, same thing, Scott, touched on that earlier. So there are a lot of opportunities there that that we\u2019re going after.","Overall, if you exclude the items noted, we\u2019re expecting CASM growth in 2017 to be effectively flat, which we\u2019re very, very confident and been able to achieve that. And we expect to hopefully continue down that path in future years as well. I think we talked about that a little bit at Investor Day.","Kevin Crissey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.","Daniel McKenzie","Oh, hey, good morning. Thanks, guys. Andrew, circling back on the balance sheet, could you update us on the principle debt that comes due this year? Just based on the last data point I have, it seems leverage should increase somewhat this year. But just setting this year aside, how should we think about that leverage, kind of the gross leverage trajectory over the coming one to three years?","Andrew Levy","Dan, we\u2019re trying to identify the actual principle repayment amount for this year. Pardon me, I think $850 million, yes, about $850 million. You\u2019re right by the way though, we do expect that it probably will increase this year as we take all these aircraft that are coming due, much of the purchase price greater than half is going to be financed with debt that will go in the balance sheet.","And we have a few debt instruments that would be coming due over the balance of the next few years secured \u2013 of an unsecured line, excuse me, actually two unsecureds and a term loan. But those are not due for another due to 2018 or 2019. So you\u2019re directionally right though that we will be adding a little bit of leverage just a type two aircraft deliveries and the financing of those assets.","Daniel McKenzie","I see. And then from the investor update, it looks like United is going to continue to retire the 50-seat RJs here, and that\u2019s a continuing theme. Any perspective you can give us on sort of the pace or rate of these 50-seat RJs as we get past 2017? It seems like the fleet restructuring part of the story, the densification, is an important part of the story here. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us a little bit more perspective on how we should think about that.","Oscar Munoz","Dan, I\u2019ll start maybe Scott can add onto it. We \u2013 just to clarify, we do not intend to retire the 50-seat fleet. We are decreasing the number of 50-seaters. But we believe the 50 seater has a long-term place in our network. As we look at our fleet plan, I talked about narrowbodies and widebodies, the regional aircraft is part of that equation as well. We\u2019re looking at what is the optimal number of 50-seaters. We know the optimal number of 70, 76-seaters is maxing out our scope clause limitations, which we talked about at our Investor Day. And we are also in the process of getting out of the smaller regional jet 37-seaters, which some of which are leaving this year and some of which, I believe are leaving next year.","So more to come on that on fleet, as we continue our valuation of the network in the fleet that we need in order to optimize our profitability and we\u2019ll update you as soon as we have more share and that\u2019s good, yes.","Daniel McKenzie","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","All right. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for the time. Hey, Oscar, in the middle of last year, you had announced the start of a comprehensive hub-and-spoke review. Should we think of that as for all intents and purposes now being done and incorporated into Scott\u2019s message from the Investor Day, or is that something that\u2019s still ongoing?","Oscar Munoz","I think there was an initial thrust to get a lot of the facts and data and sort of a general sense of direction. I think the new team has been working with that as a base. And I think while it never is actually culminating because we are always in a dynamic world. I think, Scott\u2019s latest version of it is probably the more specific focus we\u2019re taking right now.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. So I guess the \u2013 if I could call it a conclusion, the conclusion would be that the current up-structure is \u2013 it already is optimal based on everything you know today?","Scott Kirby","Yes. I suspect you\u2019re trying to ask are we going to close a hub and the answer is no.","Oscar Munoz","No.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then I guess just a quick one for Andrew. Would you provide the year-end pension deficit and also the NOL balance?","Andrew Levy","Yes, the NOL balance at year-end 2016 was approximately $4.3 billion, and the pension unfunded amount at the end of 2016 was approximately $1.8 billion.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Andrew Levy","Thank you.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks for the time. Scott, a couple of quick ones for you. One, just on Basic Economy being rolled out here in the coming months for you and the folks over at American. How impactful could something like that be to the environment?","Scott Kirby","Well, if you go back to our Investor Day commentary, which we think segmentation, this year is going to be worth $250 million, and we have good at $550 million for next year and going to a $1 billion by 2020. My personal view is those numbers are conservative, so that we\u2019re going to be better than that. But that\u2019s our \u2013 that remains our official forecast, nothing has happened because as to change that anyway.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then that $250 million or so, that\u2019s mostly just Basic Economy this year, or is some of the other stuff coming into play?","Scott Kirby","Correct.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay.","Scott Kirby","That\u2019s all Basic Economy this year.","Rajeev Lalwani","It is? Great. And then Scott, you\u2019ve historically done a very, I guess, honest job of providing your view on positive PRASM and so on. Seems like we\u2019re there today. Do you think it\u2019s sustainable as you look forward? Can you continue to get better and what are some of the biggest risk items that you are keeping an eye on to make sure that that path remains?","Scott Kirby","Well, look, it feels like we are on a really good path that \u2013 it helps to me like there was an inflection point after the election for business demand. Business demand really got stronger virtually across the board. If you combine that with the world where fuel prices are going up, and I think a lot of airlines then start raising fares. So the pricing environment has improved \u2013 is improving. At the same time, I expect that\u2019s going to continue. There\u2019s lots of unknown risks that are out there.","We\u2019ll see what happens with the economy and with confident post-transition, post-migration and transition. We certainly feel good today. But our \u2013 and our outlook is really based on the world continue to look much like it does today and assuming that happens. I think we\u2019re going to be a positive PRASM this quarter, certainly next quarter, things would be better in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis and then again \u2013 to get again on the third quarter, I think better.","Fourth quarter comps are a little harder, but we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the year, as we look out. And as Basic Economy rolls in, it will start to even overcome, I think, some of those comp issues, where the comps get harder by the fourth quarter, the Basic Economy will be a countervailing balance to that. So kind of sitting here today, I think each quarter is going to continue to get better. We\u2019ll see second derivative improvement throughout the year.","Rajeev Lalwani","Very helpful as always. Thank you, Scott.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning, everybody. Scott, in the fourth quarter, you outperformed Delta RASM in each of your operating divisions, but based on the first quarter guide, you expect that trend to reverse despite having easier comps in Q1 relative to Q4. So what\u2019s driving that reversal and is it possible that both airlines can be correct with their guides, or do you view them as fundamentally at odds with one another?","Scott Kirby","Yes. So first, I would disagree with the statement that, we\u2019re expecting to do worse than Delta in the next quarter. So I recognize our two guidance points are there, which gets to another point. I mean, in this industry and on calls like this, we spent a lot of time focused on our forecast of guidance and the two point PRASM ranges that all of us get. I bet if you go back and look at history, I bet we miss it 40% of the time. The reason is, because we don\u2019t have good visibility into the balance of the quarter.","Now, I will just give you a little bit of perspective on it. In the fourth quarter, when we were on our earnings call, our, our booked RASM for December was down something like 18% to 19%. So we were 18% to 19% behind, and we were forecasting that we were going to end the month down to 4, that\u2019s calendar \u2013 day\/week adjusted by the way, so it doesn\u2019t tie to other people\u2019s calendar numbers.","We actually ended the month down about 1.5%, that was a big swing. But when you are down 19% at the time of the earnings call and you\u2019re getting down to 4%, and you say will I actually be down 1.5% or it would be down 7.5%, that\u2019s hard to know.","Jamie Baker","Okay.","Scott Kirby","And we have poor visibility. In the fourth quarter, we were assuming that December was going to be the weakest \u2013 weaker than October, at least, and it turned out to be better. Delta said on their earnings call for the fourth quarter that they were assuming December was going to be the best, which was different and we turned out to have -- Delta turned out in the fourth quarter to be right on the trajectory and we wound up outperforming them.","My guess is the same will hold true this quarter. Our current forecast is that January is the best month and that March is the weakest month. March, by the way, is booked 15% behind on PRASM right now. The good news is yield is booked ahead and we are behind on load factor and we are expecting to make that up and get back to close to flat, but there is a lot of room left to go between here and there.","So my guess is that the real answer to your question is, we are not very good at forecasting, because the data is more variable than we would all like to believe. I would add one other point, that is you sort of hit on it by going by region. It\u2019s interesting to look mathematically at the results for us in the fourth quarter versus Delta, where we beat them on the domestic RASM by 1.5 points, in the Atlantic by 3.1, in the Pacific by 3 and in Latin America by 2.1 points, but overall only by 1.1 points. That\u2019s a little frustrating and it really speaks to the fact that just our geography is different.","We have less exposure to Latin America, more to the Pacific. That trend is going to continue in the first quarter and probably into the second quarter. The good news is, I think that starts to reverse in the third and fourth quarters and the Pacific hopefully will start to outperform. We will be overlapping Latin America. But our core performance \u2013 in the fourth quarter, we were, in each region, between 1.5 and 3 points better. And hopefully, we\u2019ll produce similar results in the first quarter, but we will see.","Jamie Baker","Excellent. I appreciate that. I sense that I may have hit a nerve with that, but the response is very disclosive and very useful. The second question on margins and maybe this is for you Scott, maybe for Andrew. But, as you know, there was no relative improvement in the fourth quarter. You\u2019re not guiding for any relative improvement to either Delta or the industry in the first quarter, that\u2019s fine. The Street actually has your margin gap to Delta getting about twice as bad in 2017.","So it\u2019s \u2013 the question is, is it still United\u2019s position that we should view 2017 as a transition year? You should be excused from margin mediocrity, or does your plan envision any second-half relative margin strengthening?","Scott Kirby","Jamie, you are trying to rub nerves.","Jamie Baker","Me?","Scott Kirby","What I would say is, first, in 2016, you strip out fuel hedging, so you strip out the fact that Delta lost a bunch of money last year hedging fuel, which is probably the right way to look at it. There was some margin gap closure. It wasn\u2019t big. It was 30 points last year. It was 40 points from 2014 to 2015 versus American, at least, based on assuming fourth quarter hits consensus, and there would have been a 120 basis points improvement versus American 2015 over 2016 and an even bigger improvement 2014 over 2015.","So there was progress being made. And if you look at our first quarter, we have a headwind, at least, relative to Delta, that our labor cost kick in right away. So we\u2019re going to be up something like, I don\u2019t remember Andrew\u2019s exact number, but 350 basis points of CASM from labor and Delta was 125 or something. Delta\u2019s big pay increase comes in April 1. So that\u2019s just the timing issue.","I very much believe that we are on a path to close the gap, everything we said at Investor Day. I feel more confident today the more I know that we are going to do it. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight. Basic Economy is an example of one of those big things that\u2019s going to be a big step function increase for us when we roll it out and start having it flying in the second quarter, feel very strongly that we\u2019re on the path that we laid out and that this is a team that is going to deliver and by 2020, we are going to have the best margins of the big three network carriers.","So we feel really good about the path we are on despite what people might want to look at the second or third derivative of margin changes based on forecast margins quarter-to-quarter.","Oscar Munoz","This is Oscar. At the end of the day, while we appreciate being held accountable for our actions and our words, we constantly have said that that\u2019s proof, not promise and so we will keep delivering and inevitably everyone will agree. But with regards to the aspiration, it is clearly not one of mediocrity, I think we have said that before. And again, I just echo Scott\u2019s words with regards to the strategy and structure we have in place to get that done. So keep asking your questions, Jamie, and we\u2019ll keep answering them. More importantly, we\u2019re going to keep delivering to the point that we convince others to buy our facts and our proofs.","Jamie Baker","Excellent. Thank you, both. I appreciate it.","Operator","From Stephens, we have Jack Atkins online. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First one here for Scott. Scott, how should we think about the potential for you all to revise your capacity growth plans as you move through 2017 if we continue to see an acceleration in the unit revenue environment? Asked another way, can you help us think about the PRASM or margin level that you all need to see before you start thinking about accelerating capacity growth versus moderating it?","Andrew Levy","Well, that\u2019s not really the way we think about it based on like system level PRASM. We do bottoms-up analysis. And our capacity did not dictate it from being or from Oscar or from anyone that\u2019s in the room here today to say, our capacity is going to be X, Y, Z based on PRASM. It\u2019s a bottoms-up forecast and that\u2019s the right way to do it.","It\u2019s by the way, it\u2019s not the way it\u2019s been done at United historically, but we\u2019re going to do bottoms up and build. And if there are opportunities then we\u2019ll find when there\u2019s places that it doesn\u2019t make sense, we\u2019ll stop flying. We\u2019ll be disciplined about looking at the financials of each route individually, and so really it\u2019s not going to be top-down-driven.","We probably right now have although more uncertainty than we would normally have and that uncertainty can go both ways plus or minus, just based on all the changes that we\u2019re making the reviews that we\u2019ve done then hub structures that we\u2019re changing. We\u2019re still working through a lot of the bottoms-up, while we conceptually know the traction and the vision that we have for the future the exact timing and when it\u2019s going to go. And if it work perhaps, you\u2019ve got to be determined and so we\u2019re going to do bottoms-up process market-by-market and hub-by-hub.","Jack Atkins","Okay. Thank you for that. And then last question here just to follow up, given the strength that we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. dollar post the election, fluctuations we\u2019ve seen in foreign currencies, obviously, that has an impact on passenger revenue overall, but can you speak to just the changes in demand patterns that you are seeing, if any, due to the fluctuations that we\u2019ve seen in currency?","Andrew Levy","I have looked that enough to tell you that we\u2019ve seen anything of significance where I think you\u2019re implying, for example, reselling more point of origin in the U.S. and set a point of origin foreign companies \u2013 foreign countries. If we are it\u2019s not data that I\u2019ve seen, so no conclusion for us.","Jack Atkins","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker online. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys, it\u2019s actually O\u2019 Connor [ph] in for Helane. So business yields obviously outperformed your expectations in the fourth quarter. But I just want to talk a little bit about the demand side. What\u2019s your expectation for corporate travel growth in the first quarter and what was it in fourth quarter?","Andrew Levy","We don\u2019t have specific expectations for corporate growth that we try to forecast or if we do no one has ever told me about it. It\u2019s been positive. We saw throughout post-election we\u2019ve seen positive business demand, positive business growth. First-half of the year has started strong. We\u2019ve had so far in January, RASM has been up every single day except for two. One of those two was January 1st, which was down something like 20% because the Sunday versus Sunday last year very different. And then we had one other day that was down 1.3% that\u2019s indicative of strong business demand and close in demand. But I don\u2019t have a specific forecast for corporate demand is going to do, it\u2019s strong right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Sorry, go ahead.","Oscar Munoz","Sorry, Connor, I was going to add just and you see the same data with regards to business round table and all those different surveys that are out there is general. You have consumer index, which is positive. I mean we also have just sort of business sentiment been higher. So we\u2019re aware of that same issues. But as Scott said, we\u2019re seeing some of bit in our business as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then Andrew, just on the \u2013 about the fleet a little bit, I know you didn\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to make a commitment until later in the year. But can you just talk a little bit about the widebody fleet? And so I know you\u2019re taking up the 20 747s this year. Are there any big retirements that you expect in 2018? The reason I\u2019m asking is just because trying to match up your order book with your expected retirement just like and see if there\u2019s an actual potential deferral or whatever that you could possibly do later on? Thanks.","Andrew Levy","Well, I would first start out by saying that that we\u2019d like to reach decision on fleet as soon as we can. So we\u2019re not holding back till later in the year. We\u2019re just doing the hard work to make sure that we make the right decisions. So as soon as our work is done, we\u2019ll share it. We at this point in time other than the 747 fleet, we do not have any retirement plans for the rest of fleet.","That being said, obviously, those are some of the things that we\u2019re talking about as we review the fleet, because we\u2019re looking at not only make decisions for the next couple of years, but looking out many more years into the future. And so there will be more to share as time goes on and we concluded our work. But other than the 74s, the rest of the fleet we expect to continue to operate, you have information on the delivery stream that we have out there at the moment.","As we mentioned, anything that we can look at because it\u2019s far enough into the future, there\u2019s a part of the review that we\u2019re conducting. And so, there maybe changes, but we\u2019ll see and we\u2019ll let you know since we do.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks and congrats, Julie, on the move over. All of the revenue questions so far this earnings season have been a little less insightful without you on the line. [Multiple Speakers] So I wanted to follow-up on Jamie\u2019s question. Just with respect to margins, and I think so much of the conversation is relative, but I guess I\u2019d take absolute. When do you think \u2013 what are you driving the business to begin to stabilize and expand margins again? Is it fair that this is completely off the table every quarter of this year, or are you driving the business to expand margins this year?","Andrew Levy","Well, we\u2019re trying to \u2013 our margin expansion, we all believe that we\u2019re going to be able to expand margins. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be an exact trajectory of, it\u2019s going to get 50 basis points better this quarter and 50 basis points next quarter. There\u2019s a lot of volatility in that. We think we\u2019re on a path to expand margins with all the stuff we laid out at an Investor Day, that\u2019s not just relative, but that\u2019s also an absolute.","In the first quarter of this year, we got a big headwind from the labor deals and from fuel prices. So it\u2019s going to go negative for us to go negative for everyone in that quarter. But we think, we\u2019re taking longer-term view about the margin trajectory, and we think we\u2019re on a path that\u2019s going to get us sustainably higher margins. But it\u2019s not going to be on exact every single quarter it goes up, because there\u2019s just too much volatility in the business in the short-term.","Duane Pfennigwerth","So margin expansion is off the table this year, in any quarter of this year, or that is too strong a statement?","Scott Kirby","I know that\u2019s too stronger statement.","Oscar Munoz","Way too stronger statement.","Scott Kirby","That I mean we\u2019re guiding, where we\u2019ve given you guidance for the first quarter and really that\u2019s another side, maybe we\u2019ve given you full-year guidance. But we\u2019re \u2013 we just \u2013 the answer is, we don\u2019t know. We\u2019re certainly going to try to enhance margin that\u2019s our number one focus just to drive margin higher. And I believe we can get there.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then, Scott, maybe just big picture, there has been some consolidation touching some carriers in SFO. You\u2019ve had some low-cost carrier access in Newark. Can you quantify these headwinds or tailwinds in your revenue trends into what you can see so far?","Scott Kirby","Well, I\u2019m not going to quantify it, but I\u2019ll say that we\u2019re going to compete aggressively on both of those fronts.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. And then just lastly on Atlantic, it feels like you may be sandbagging most egregiously there. I don\u2019t know how it can\u2019t get better with comps as weak as they are and with capacity coming down. Is there anything that we might be missing in that perspective? Thank you.","Scott Kirby","Well, I hope you\u2019re right.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Comps go \u2013 comps get about 600 basis points easier, your capacity growth decelerates, so how do we get to kind of the same outcome for 1Q?","Scott Kirby","Look, I hope you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t spend as much time trying to make sure that trying to you spend more time trying to make sure that forecast is as close as you can get, so your model is right. I spend a lot more time trying to maximize revenue, and so I hope you\u2019re right.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] And from Wall Street Journal, we have Susan Carey. Please go ahead.","Susan Carey","Good morning, everybody. Scott, I kind of want to come back to Basic Economy with your. You talked about incremental revenue I believe of $250 million this year $518 million in 2021 bill. Is this all from Basic Economy? And can you tell us when the rollout is going to be domestic only? Do you have plans for it to roll it internationally was the question?","Scott Kirby","Yes, so our numbers are more \u2013 in this year it\u2019s mostly about Basic Economy. But moving forward, it\u2019s also about having Premium Economy and even includes things like once you\u2019ve got more products, I think, you have more customers buy actual paid first ticket, which is once they\u2019ve got the option of Basic Economy, Main Cabin, Premium Economy first class to first class price now looks a lot closer to Premium Economy. And so people today are looking at what is officially a Basic Economy price versus first class, the differential is big.","So there\u2019s a bunch involved in our number that\u2019s not just Basic Economy or even Basic Economy and Premium Economy. As to rollout, we\u2019re going to start selling it later this quarter. And the first travel will be in the second quarter at some point in the second quarter. So we\u2019re still working through all the final make sure everything is done, make sure it works right and but coming soon.","Susan Carey","But is it going to be domestic only at the outset?","Scott Kirby","Yes, sorry, Susan, I forgot that part. At the very beginning, it\u2019s going to actually the only one station. And I guess I could\u2026","Susan Carey","Which one?","Scott Kirby","Minneapolis. We\u2019re going to roll that in Minneapolis and we\u2019ve serviced all of our hubs from there. We have a great team there. We\u2019ve had some history with us of rolling out new products. And so we\u2019re going to roll it out there just kind of make sure everything works then we\u2019ll roll it out to the rest of the domestic system. We expect to have it in the rest of the domestic system in the not too distant future. And then we\u2019ll roll it out to \u2013 we also tend to roll it out to near international, so places like the Carrabin, as an example, and we\u2019ll contemplate long-haul international after that. We don\u2019t have a plan one way or another on that. But we expect to get it rolled out across the entire domestic and near haul international system not too long after we launch it assuming it\u2019s going well.","Susan Carey","Thank you.","Operator","From the Associated Press, we have David Koenig. Please go ahead.","David Koenig","All right. Hi, guys, just following up on the basically\u2026","Oscar Munoz","Hey, David.","David Koenig","Hello.","Oscar Munoz","Yes, hi.","David Koenig","Yes, okay. Yes, just follow-up on Basic Economy American just announced details of their Basic Economy offering, including a date for putting that fare on sale. And they said this is an issue that you caught some flak over. American says its flight attendants are not going to monitor whether those Basic Economy passenger put their personal item in the carry on bin. How is that going to work at United? And what is your learn from the public reaction to your proposal so far, what you said about it so far?","Scott Kirby","Well, that\u2019s absolutely true that we\u2019re not going to ask flight attendants to monitor. What we\u2019ll do is collect the bags the size of carryon bag that like a roller board, we will collect those at the gate and if customer does get to the gate, which we think we\u2019ll be able to screen most customers and keep them from getting to the \u2013 in the lobby, we\u2019ll be able to get bag to the lobby. But when customer does get to the gate, they\u2019re going to be charged at the gate a bag fee plus the handling fee to have gate shut for that bag. And so they just won\u2019t be on the airplane, those bags, so there is nothing for the flight attendant to monitor.","Now I suppose a customer could put a personal item like a purse in the overhead, but and fine, but we\u2019re not going to ask our flight attendants to monitor anything and we are going to leave our flight attendants to deliver the greater customer service they do today. And actually just make their job better, because a lot of times they are stuck trying to help move bags around when the cabin is full and that\u2019s a difficult part of their job and we\u2019re going to minimize that happening with Basic Economy.","David Koenig","It sounds like you\u2019ve slowed down the whole rollout here. Is that because of the reaction when you first disclosed some of the details around you\u2026","Scott Kirby","We haven\u2019t slowed anything down at all.","David Koenig","Okay.","Scott Kirby","We are making sure we get it right. We have even as late as this week had more test on making sure that we\u2019re communicating it clearly to customer when they purchase. As I said earlier on the call that to me is the most important thing that we\u2019re doing and making sure our communication to customer is just crystal clear.","Second big thing that we\u2019re doing is making sure that our airport team has done an incredible job and had some really clever ways to make sure that we keep bags \u2013 get bags all in the lobby, but to make sure that we\u2019re going to be able to implement this operationally and do so smoothly. So no slowdown at all. We are just making sure we got all the eyes dotted and TS crossed.","David Koenig","Okay. Thanks, Scott.","Scott Kirby","Yes.","Operator","From Bloomberg News, we have Michael Sasso online. Please go ahead.","Michael Sasso","Yes, good morning. Could you just talk about I think you talked in the recent past about beefing up your offerings out of O\u2019Hare, maybe adding some additional connecting locations to O\u2019Hare, particularly from maybe some smaller spoke cities and such can you talk about your plans for that. What you\u2019ve done how expensive do you expect that to be?","Scott Kirby","Well, we\u2019ve already just started adding some in places like new services to San Jose. And I\u2019m not sure when our next schedule is going to get published. But when we have our summer schedule, we will expect to have a few more destinations and a few more frequencies, particularly in some of our competitive markets and that\u2019s something that I think is just every season and every schedule change, we are going to continue to be growing here in Chicago. We are excited about the future here. We think there\u2019s great opportunity for us and we are going to start implementing some of that this summer and it\u2019s just going to be a continuous process for several years.","Michael Sasso","And just a follow-up, I think somebody mentioned that you are doing this partly in response to American and some growth that American has done in Chicago and will you seek to much American\u2019s growth, or the number of connections or whatnot they have in Chicago? How does this relate to what American has done in Chicago?","Scott Kirby","Well, I don\u2019t know where you heard that from. I don\u2019t think I said anything like that. We think we have a great opportunity. We have a better and larger hub here. We do have a better product. We have great people. We have better reliability in Chicago than American Airlines and so we think that\u2019s a growth opportunity for us to go out and win here in Chicago and we are going to do that.","Operator","From FlightGlobal, we have Edward Russell. Please go ahead.","Edward Russell","Hi, thank you for taking my question. There has been some discussions of management headcount reductions recently. Could you provide some more detail on what functions are being reduced and how many employees are going to be leaving the company?","Oscar Munoz","Ed, this is Oscar. Over the course of the year, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that our structure has to follow our strategy and post the work that we did at Investor Day, we\u2019ve been reorganizing our folks specifically to align with our customer initiatives, with our margin initiatives. We have created a Chief Customer Officer, for instance. We have bifurcated and focused our financial organization to be more directly impacting both the commercial and operational side separately. There\u2019s a host of things, but enough to meet that that have progressed. In that process, we\u2019ve also found some bureaucracy and some redundancy in and some redundancy in certain areas and so while there has been some exits of a relatively small number, we\u2019ve had equal or greater impact by a lot of promotions, a lot of job transfers and a lot of job specificity focused on the things that our strategy evolve.","So as the overall numbers, there is no goal; there is no specific number to report. We\u2019re just trying to sort of, again, focus our great company on the future.","Edward Russell","Okay. If I could ask one follow-up. I\u2019ve heard some discussion of say the fuel hedging team is going to be reduced or eliminated. I mean, can you talk about is that happening as you shift away from fuel hedging, or other departments that are going to be impacted?","Andrew Levy","Yes, this is Andrew. So we are no longer hedging fuel. We do have a very small number of folks that involved in that and I believe they are going to be reassigned to other areas within the company. That was never a large number of folks in that group.","Oscar Munoz","Ed, this is Oscar, again, just one thing I neglected to say, and I think it\u2019s a very important part of that. In the organizational effectiveness initiative that we are going through, the front line, our front managers, our customers are not impacted in anyway. In fact, we anticipate hiring thousands of people as we do every year with regards to sort of refreshening our front-line organization.","Edward Russell","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And finally from the TheStreet, we have Ted Reed. Please go head.","Ted Reed","Thank you. I have two questions. First, I was surprised that your margin in first quarter is in single digits. Why is that? Is there something structural at United or seasonal that keeps your margin low \u2013 that low in the first quarter?","Andrew Levy","Yes, we have less exposure to Florida and the Caribbean. And so the first quarter is always the lowest quarter for United compared to Delta and American, but it\u2019s just about where our hubs are. We don\u2019t have a hub in Atlanta or your hometown of Charlotte.","Ted Reed","Okay. Thank you. And secondly, Scott, you talked about changes at San Francisco. Is that because San Francisco is working so well that you don\u2019t need to change it, or is that one of the hubs you were saying on the investor call that the flights are too closely aligned with international and not with domestic? Is that not true in San Francisco and in connection with that, do you still plan to continue the policy of increasing flights to interior China?","Scott Kirby","We \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been pleased with the results of the interior China so far. And so we are \u2013 I\u2019 m at least agnostic about whether we continue to grow there. If it is working, we will and if it\u2019s not, we won\u2019t, so it all depends on the results. I do think that there\u2019s opportunity for us in San Francisco.","We\u2019re a little more facility-constrained there and so figuring out how we can get more gates to grow and add capacity is one of the critical things that we have to do. It\u2019s easier to talk about some of the other mid-continent connecting hubs as opposed to San Francisco, where we\u2019ve got constraints, but it\u2019s a fantastic market for us. It\u2019s the best Asian gateway that \u2013 of any gateway in the U.S.. We have a great customer base there. We have a great team in San Francisco, and we would like to find ways to get more gates and actually grow there.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you, Scott.","Julie Yates Stewart","Okay, thanks to all for joining the call today. Please contact Media Relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining.

My name is Brandon and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. (Operator Instructions). I will now turn the presentation over to your hosts for today's call, Nene Foxhall and Sarah Murphy. Please go ahead.","Nene Foxhall","Thank you Brandon. Good morning everyone, and welcome to United's fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings conference call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President, and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which Jim will review operational performance, capacity, and revenue results. John will follow with a discussion of our cost structure, balance sheet, and guidance. Jeff will make a few closing remarks, and then we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We would appreciate if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll turn it over to Sarah Murphy.","Sarah Murphy","Thank you Nene. This morning, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Both are available on our website at ir.united.com. Let me point out that information in this morning\u2019s earnings release and investor update and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represents the company\u2019s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings, United Airlines, and Continental Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website.","Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter and the full year. These items are detailed in our earnings release, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, Chairman, President, and CEO of United.","Jeff Smisek","Thanks Nene and Sarah, and thank you all for joining us on our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 earnings call. Today, we reported net income of $589 million for the full year or $1.59 per diluted share delivering a pre-tax margin of 1.6%. 2012 was the toughest year of our merger integration, and it wasn\u2019t an easy year for our co-workers or our customers. Despite our integration pains, we accomplished an enormous amount and we are now in a position to go forward as a single carrier and compete effectively on a global scale. Our operations are running smoothly where many product improvements are rolling out and our customer satisfaction scores are climbing. I want to thank all of my co-workers for working together during 2012 to help build the base for United\u2019s future. I\u2019m pleased to recognize my co-workers\u2019 hard work with a $119 million of profit sharing which we will distribute to eligible co-workers on February 14.","I also want to thank our customers for choosing to fly United. We\u2019re working hard every day to make your travel experience a great one, and you\u2019ll see continued improvement in our product and service as 2013 unfolds. In 2013, we will move beyond our merger; we will continue to deliver on our go-forward plan, the annual operating plan we use to guide our efforts and investments company wide.","Our top priorities this year include running a consistently reliable airline, providing great customer service, bringing the rest of our work groups together, continuing to invest in our people, our technology, and our product offering, and running United as a business to achieve our return on invested capital target of 10% over the business cycle.","We did not achieve our return on invested capital target in 2012, and we\u2019re absolutely not satisfied with the financial results we produced last year. We need to generate better unit revenue and operate more efficiently, and we\u2019re taking actions to address both of those areas. Leadership starts at the top, and in December we reduce the number of our officers by 7%. Today, we internally announced the difficult but necessary decision to reduce our management and administrative staff by 6% starting next month. We have many other actions planned to increase efficiency and increase our revenues throughout 2013 and beyond.","I want to thank my co-workers for their professional response and empathy towards customers and fellow co-workers in the aftermath of super storm Sandy, which reduced our fourth quarter earnings by approximately $85 million. Our operations substantially improved in the fourth quarter triggering two on-time bonus payouts for our co-workers. I would like to thank my frontline co-workers for doing a great job managing high loads during the holidays, made more challenging by snow storms that hit a number of our hubs.","We\u2019re back on track running a reliable operation, and we\u2019ll continue to support our operations through higher than normal staffing at airports, spare aircraft levels, and maintenance programs over the next few quarters to ensure that our operation performs as we and our customers expect it to.","Customers are noticing our improved operational reliability, and as I mentioned earlier, our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve as does feedback from our corporate customers. We\u2019re keenly focused on improving our customer service, and we\u2019ve begun a comprehensive customer service training program for our airport agents, contact center agents, and flight attendants worldwide. By the end of January, all airport contact centers, in-flight supervisors, and peer leaders will have completed training on how to lead their teams to provide great service. As we finish training the leadership, we will train all of our airport and contact center agents and flight attendants across the globe on our new customer service standards, and we\u2019ll complete all of this training this year.","United is committed to providing great customer service each and every day, and it is the responsibility of every co-worker to do so. At our internal leadership conference next week, we will roll out, It\u2019s Our Job,\u201d a company-wide integrated approach to customer service. It's Our Job includes training that clearly explains our customer service standards and expectations for frontline co-workers.","The program also includes an expanded outperform recognition program that rewards more employees for outstanding service and a broad based quarterly bonus program tied to improvements in customer satisfaction scores. This year, we will collect more detailed customer satisfaction data and begin customer service quality reviews across the system improving the quality and quantity of service delivery data that will help us identify areas of opportunity and future training needs.","Importantly, our co-workers want to provide great customer service; they take pride in it and we in-turn take pride in their efforts. This year, we\u2019re making sure they will have the tools that help them do their jobs. Throughout the year, we\u2019ll be rolling out a modernized fully integrated suite of tools for our airport agents that expands on recent enhancements and allows our agents to provide better and more efficient service to our customers.","We\u2019ll first implement these new tools at the gates to assist with the departure management process and improve the boarding experience for our customers. Later in the year, we\u2019ll expand these tools to include ticketing and check-in functions in the lobby.","We\u2019re also investing in our customer relationship management technology to better understand our customers\u2019 individual preferences when they travel. The more we understand our customer\u2019s preferences, the better we\u2019ll be able to design and offer tailored products and services that meet or exceed their expectations and improve our profitability. Last year, we made substantial progress bringing our work groups together, an important step in building our working together culture. In December, our pilots ratified our first joint collective bargaining agreement, a four-year contract that marks to market the pay of our pilots while increasing their productivity and our scope flexibility.","Additionally our subsidiary United, subsidiary Continental, and Continental Micronesia flight attendants, and Continental Micronesia technicians ratified a new collective bargaining agreement during 2012. Toward the end of last year, our negotiations for joint collective bargaining agreement with our airport and contact center agents represented by the IAM gained significant traction and continued on a good path early on the New Year.","We\u2019re in expedited discussions for joint collective bargaining agreement with our technicians represented by the Teamsters, and we\u2019re also in discussions for joint collective bargaining agreements with our flight attendants and our dispatchers. We understand the importance of marking to market, the wages and benefits of our people, and we\u2019re committed to reaching competitive joint contracts with all of our work groups.","In addition to seeing improved customer service this year, our customers will begin to experience the many product improvements we\u2019ve discussed since our merger. By the end of the first quarter, 96% of our mainline fleet will have our very popular economy plus seating. Additionally, we have installed over 6800 flatbed seats in the premium cabins of our international aircraft, more than any of our U.S. competitors. In February, we will finish modifying our domestic Boeing 767 aircraft to an international configuration with fully flatbed seats in the business first cabin, seat back audio\/video on demand, and power outlets throughout the aircraft.","Customers today are using the new larger overhead bins on 70 of our airbus aircraft, and we\u2019ll finish installing those bigger bins across the rest of that fleet this year. We\u2019re installing global satellite based Wi-Fi across our mainline fleet with a modest number of aircraft outfitted to date, including our first Boeing 747.","We\u2019re ramping up installation and expect to install global satellite based Wi-Fi on 300 of our mainline aircraft by yearend, and we will continue installation next year until substantially all of our mainline aircraft have this industry-leading Wi-Fi product.","We took delivery of 25 new aircraft last year including six Boeing 787 Dreamliners. History teaches us that all new aircraft types have issues, and the 787 is no different. We continue to have confidence in the aircraft and in Boeing\u2019s ability to fix the issues just as they have done on every other new aircraft model they have produced. Safety is of course our top priority, and we\u2019re working closely with the FAA and Boeing to safely return our 787 aircraft to service. In 2013, we expect to take delivery of 26 new fuel efficient and customer pleasing aircraft including two more Dreamliners in the second half of the year. At the end of last year, we opened our first completely redesigned and expanded United Club at Terminal 2 of O' Hare International Airport, and we\u2019re receiving outstanding feedback from our customers on the look, feel, and usability of the club.","If you\u2019re passing through O\u2019Hare, I encourage you to drop by the club for a glimpse of the future. This year, we will renovate four additional United Clubs around the network with this superb new look and feel. As with our operations, our service standards, and our people, we will continue to make substantial return-oriented investments in our product and customer experience this year. I\u2019m confident that our focus on operational reliability, customer service, product improvements, and our working together culture will put United on the right track for creating economic value in 2013 and beyond as we become the world\u2019s leading airline. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim and John to go through the results in greater detail.","Jim Compton","Thanks Jeff. I would like to take a moment to thank my co-workers for their hard work in 2012. Our operational performance and revenue results last year did not meet our expectations or our potential, but we built the foundation for United from which we\u2019ll provide consistent reliability, a competitive product offering, and a great customer service in 2013. I would also like to thank our customers for choosing to fly United. We appreciate your business and our working together to make United the best airline for you.","Our operational performance improved in the fourth quarter, and we delivered 80% on-time performance for the quarter despite severe weather including super-storm Sandy and snow storms. In 2012, we paid out six on-time bonuses totaling $26 million to our co-workers for achieving monthly on-time goals including two pay-outs during the fourth quarter.","Our fourth quarter mishandled bag ratio improved nearly 10% from the summer lows. It takes team work, reliable fleet, and the right processes and procedures to run a consistently reliable airline, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in those areas this year. Running a reliable airline is highly correlated with customer satisfaction scores and passenger revenue results. As we improved our reliability at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter, our customer satisfaction scores improved nicely, and we have recently seen encouraging progress with passenger revenue. I look forward to more closely integrating the way we manage both operations and revenue in my new role.","Our full year consolidated capacity declined 1.5% year-over-year in 2012 demonstrating our continued commitment to capacity discipline. In the fourth quarter, consolidated capacity was 4.2% lower versus 2011. Our approach to capacity deployment remains the same, met supply with demand on a market by market basis. Through this approach, we\u2019re confident we can optimize our broad network and generate returns in excess of our cost of capital.","As we experienced merger-related operational issues last year, we took actions to support our integration and our operations that did not optimize our network or revenue and that added to our cost. Examples include higher staffing levels at airports, carrying a higher level of spare aircraft, and modestly increasing our block and ground time. During 2013, as we streamline our boarding process, deliver on our new easy-to-use and more intuitive technology for our co-workers at airports, and consistently deliver reliable operations we\u2019ll begin to unwind these actions.","Now turning to our revenue results, consolidated passenger unit revenue increased 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 1.7% for the full-year versus 2011. These results include $140 million of loss revenue due to super storm Sandy. The Pacific was our best performing geographic region in the fourth quarter and for the full year. As PRASM increased 5.9% and 5.8% respectively. Both higher yields and loads contributed to the solid performance. China continued to be a highlight in the fourth quarter with PRASM increasing 9% and yield increasing 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Our ancillary revenue increased 2% and 3% respectively for the fourth quarter and full-year 2012 compared to 2011. Our fourth quarter capacity reduction resulted in fewer [employments] (ph) and in turn lower checked bag and change fee revenue. During the fourth quarter, we implemented a second bag fee for travel between the U.S. and Japan and are the only U.S. carrier to apply this important cost recovery mechanism across our entire transpacific network.","We have heard from our customers how much they value more space to work and relax when they travel, and we\u2019re pleased to offer the seating products that they value and will pay for. Economy Plus continued its outstanding performance with 33% sales growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 25% growth for the full-year 2012. Sales of paid premium upgrades increased 58% in the fourth quarter and 34% for the full year versus 2011.","A significant portion of the increase in economy plus and paid premium upgrade sales is due to pricing optimization permitted by our powerful SHARES platform. While our corporate revenue for the full year increased modestly due to higher yields, we\u2019re dissatisfied with the 2012 results. The operational challenges we faced last summer impacted our corporate customers, and our corporate revenue and share premium performance lagged our expectations.","Put simply, some of our corporate customers took a detour while the road was under construction, and we suffered for it. We\u2019re confident, however, that in 2013, we will win back those corporate customers and attract new corporate customers with our significantly improved operational reliability, our improving customer service, our competitive product, and our industry-leading network.","We aspire to be the travel partner of choice for our corporate customers. A partner that helps them reach their goals. We also know how important it is to listen to our customers, and we have an ongoing dialogue with many of the travel managers at our top accounts throughout through our corporate advisory board. Through frequent conversations with our corporate advisory board members, we keep our finger on the pulse of our customers\u2019 expectations, experiences, and aspirations for United. From our most recent conversations, we know our corporate customers are experiencing firsthand the improvements in our reliability, customer service, and product offering.","Route network and schedule convenience may be the most important factors when many business customers choose an airline , but we recognize the importance of running an on-time airline and offering great service with a competitive product as well.","United\u2019s best in class global route network is ideal for business travelers through our international gateways in New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. We help our customers access the world. Our hubs are located in six of the eight largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. and are uniquely positioned across the country to create an unmatched domestic and international network offering for our corporate customers.","We\u2019re investing more than $0.5 billion in our product, making our customers\u2019 travel experience more comfortable, relaxing, and simple. Beginning this quarter, our customers are going to experience many of the product investments we have been talking about for some time. United offers travelers the best options on board from more room to work and relax. Today, we have a 176 wide-body aircraft outfitted with our comfortable, lie-flat flat seats in the premium cabins. In February, every wide-body aircraft flying across the Atlantic will have lie-flat seats in the premium cabins. Our entire long-haul wide-body international fleet will have lie-flat seats by the end of the second quarter.","Our industry leading Economy Plus seating is available on nearly our entire mainline fleet and on almost all of our larger regional aircraft. As just mentioned we\u2019re installing global satellite based Wi-Fi across our entire mainline fleet and early customer feedback is very positive. We\u2019re the first U.S. airline that will be able to offer our customers the opportunity to stay in touch no matter where they are flying around the globe.","Our product investments are not only on our aircraft. This quarter we will introduce the first phase on a new simplified boarding process that will release some of the boarding stress our customers experience. We\u2019re keenly focused on delivering great customer service and we\u2019re training and equipping our co-workers to be able to deliver on that goal. We also continued to invest in our very popular mobile app in united.com making it easier for customers to do business with us.","This year as our customers experience an improved reliability and substantial investments in our products and service while traveling on our industry leading route network, our value proposition will appeal more than ever to global corporate customers, small business travelers and leisure customers alike, we want every customer from Global First to last row of Economy to have a great travel experience on United.","As for our capacity outlook we have operated in an environment of slow global economic growth for the last few years and based on the latest GDP information the 2013 outlook is similar. We expect our full year 2013 capacity to decline about 1.5% and expect first quarter capacity to decline between 4.1% and 5.1% year-over-year. We\u2019re committed to capacity discipline and achieving our return on invested capital goal.","Turning to our January outlook, we\u2019re running a solid operation month to-date with our domestic mainline and on-time arrival at 84% above our internal goal. And our mainline system completion factor is 99.5%. And finally we currently estimate United\u2019s generated consolidated PRASM to increase about 2.5% year-over-year. With that I will turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks Jim. Today we reported full year net income of $589 million generating a pretax margin on 1.6% for the year. While we reported a full year profit for 2012 these results clearly fell short of our expectations and the return goals we have set.","However I don\u2019t want that to take away from the tremendous efforts of our frontline co-workers. They are the face of United to our customers and bore the brunt of the integration challenges last year. And I want to thank them for their work. We\u2019re all glad to have the heavy lifting of a merger integration behind us. For the fourth quarter and full year 2012 our consolidated operating expenses increased 1.1% and 3.2% respectively. Full year 2012 CASM excluding fuel, third party business expense and profit sharing, increased 3.4% year-over-year on 1.5% lower capacity. On a fuel rate and profit sharing neutral basis full year unit cost increased 2.5% versus 2011.","Fourth quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel, third party business expense and profit sharing increased 6.5% versus 2011 on 4.2% lower capacity. Holding fuel rate and profit sharing constant our fourth quarter consolidated unit cost increased 4.8% year-over-year. In 2012 we continue to make progress improving our balance sheet making $1.5 billion of debt in capital lease payments including $265 million of prepayments. We ended the year with $6.5 billion of unrestricted cash.","One of the real opportunities we have to provide value to our shareholders is to reduce the level and type of debt in our business and the cost associated with that debt. We\u2019re paying down high coupon, non-aircraft debt and reducing our reliance on debt financing to run the day to day operation instead accessing the capital markets to fund long term investments in our business. We continue to make progress in this area in 2012 paying off about $340 million of non-aircraft debt with an average coupon of over 11%.","Our full year 2012 interest expense was $122 million lower than it was in 2011. At the end of the year we reached an agreement to amend the terms of two series of notes held by the PBGC, that the old United issued in its bankruptcy. The first series were 8% unsecured notes that the company was obligated to issue over time as certain EBITDA thresholds were met.","The maximum amount which could have been issued was $500 million with $188 million already incurred. The second series with a 6% unsecured notes also held by the PBGC due in 2031. A recent agreement reduced the principal amount of the 8% notes to $400 million in return for issuing them now and removing the contingency and shortened the maturity of the 6% notes.","For the last three years our return on invested capital has been 10.7% above our 10% target. However for the full year 2012 our return on invested capital of 8% was below our target. We\u2019re committed to achieving our return on invested capital goal and we\u2019ve taken a number of steps to ensure we do so in 2013. First and foremost we have addressed the operational issues we faced last summer. Given our improved operations and increasing customer satisfaction scores we expect our revenue performance to improve this year. We also need to become more efficient. We\u2019ve a number of initiatives planned for 2013 that will increase our efficiency and mitigate some of the cost pressures we face. As Jeff mentioned we recently reduced our officer headcount by 7% and are reducing our management and administrative overhead by 6% to a mix of voluntary and involuntary reductions.","As Jim explained we took a number of steps to address the operational issues we faced last summer and some of these actions resulted in higher cost as we consistently demonstrate our ability to run a good operation we will increase our efficiency and we will remove the cost associated with these actions. ","We did a good job in 2012 in achieving cost and other revenue synergies but clearly underperformed from a passenger revenue synergy perspective. We\u2019re confident though that we will achieve the full merger synergies and look to get back on track on our passenger revenue synergies in 2013. ","Turning to 2013 unit cost, we expect full year CASM excluding fuel, third party business expense and profit sharing to increase between 4.5% and 5.5% year-over-year on lower capacity.","This is higher than our CASM performance in past years and higher than what we expect on a normal run-rate basis. Approximately 2.5 points of the year-over-year CASM increase for 2013 is due to labor agreements. A significant portion of our co-workers had not received a pay increase for a number of years and we\u2019re committed to paying our employees competitive market wages. The wage pressure in 2013 is effectively a mark to market adjustment that is larger than the ongoing normal year-over-year labor cost pressure we expect to incur in future years.","An additional 1\/3rd of point of year-over-year CASM pressure is due to increased pension expense which is largely a result of a lower expected discount rate. We have a $2.4 billion unfunded pension obligation and while this is a long term obligation that needs to be managed just like debt the accounting cost of that obligation can change significantly from one year to the next.","The remaining approximately 2% year-over-year increase in CASM is what we consider core CASM growth and is much more in line what we would expect in our normal year and include some improvements in efficiency. Despite our higher CASM growth in 2013 we remain committed to achieving a return on invested capital goal of 10%.","Because of the timing of some of the cost pressures I mentioned our year-over-year CASM increase in 2013 is not evenly distributed among the quarters and is skewed heavily toward the first part of the year.","We expect first quarter CASM excluding fuel, third party business expense and profit sharing to increase 8% to 9% versus the first quarter 2012. We\u2019re projecting a consolidated capacity decline of between 4.1% and 5.1% in the first quarter which also puts additional pressure on our first quarter CASM.","We expect CASM growth to moderate significantly in the second half of the year with an increase between 2% and 3% year-over-year. We took delivery of 25 aircrafts in 2012 including six Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 19 Boeing 737 900ERs and removed 23 aircraft from service in the year including 19 737 Classics, 3 767 200s and one Boeing 757.","We also sold or returned to lessors 37 aircraft that had been parked in the desert. In 2013, we expect to take delivery of two more Dreamliners and 24 Boeing 737 900ERs which will replace older less efficient aircraft in our mainline fleet. We expect to end the year with 10 fewer mainline aircraft than we started the year with a total of 692 aircraft.","Our 2013 scheduled debt and capital lease principal payments amount to $1.9 billion, $600 million of these obligations are the secured notes that carry interest rates of 9.875% on the first lien and 12% on the second lien. These instruments mature in the back half of 2013 but allow for prepayment without penalty next month which we intend to do.","We expect 2013 gross capital expenditures including purchase deposits of $2.5 billion or $1.4 billion net of expected financing. ","Earnings instability and liquidity issues prior to our merger resulted in chronic underinvestment in our business. To provide the product we need to achieve our earnings and return on invested capital targets we played catch up with capital investment for the last two years. Of the 1.4 billion in net CapEx in 2013 approximately 40% to 50% is for items that are more one time in nature that we don\u2019t expect to incur on a consistent basis. For example we\u2019re building a new data center and two new maintenance hangers and installing new overhead bins, slim line seats, winglets and Wi-Fi.","We have the need and the intent to get to a more balanced approach to cash flow allocation as we complete the integration and harvest the benefits of our merger.","Lastly as we move beyond the peak of our integration we expect integration related cash special charges to abate significantly in 2013 to approximately $250 million. In closing, 2012 was the toughest year of our integration but it's behind us. That said our disappointment about reporting almost 600 million of profit for the year is a clear sign of the increasing health and stability of our industry and of United specifically.","It shows the progress we\u2019re making towards becoming a real business that provides consistent returns for our shareholders. As I talk with many of our customers and co-workers they are encouraged by the significant progress we\u2019ve made since the depths of our integration issues last summer. They like many of our investors recognize the potential that United has in 2013 and beyond. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeff Smisek","Thanks John. We\u2019ve a lot of momentum now and in 2013 we\u2019re going to run a reliable airline and provide great customer service. We\u2019ll deliver on our go-forward plan and use our ever improving fleet, facilities, technology, product, network and customer service to become the airline customers want to fly, investors want to invest in and co-workers want to work for. I\u2019ll now turn over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.","Sarah Murphy","","Thank you, Jeff. First we\u2019ll take questions from the analyst community, then we\u2019ll take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Brandon, please provide the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","","Two questions here and maybe the first one is for Jeff. You have the pilot deal, you have that all set up but now you have to go through the seniority integration process, what\u2019s the timing on that and at what point if an agreement is not reached between the two groups would we go to binding arbitration, if you can just update us on that.","Jeff Smisek","Well we expect, Michael, we expect the seniority list integration to be accomplished this year and we currently see no issues in them reaching their agreement at a timely basis.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Okay good, and then just my second question and this is for you Jeff as well. You know 2012 indicated was a tough year, you did about 600 million of net and I look at a company like Delta who has roughly the same size as you on a revenue basis and they were 1.6 billion of net, when you talked earlier about the momentum you felt like that things were really starting to turn. Is that a gap that you think that you can close this year or is it more like a multi-year process to catch up with them. How quickly can things improve now that you\u2019ve gotten over the big hump?","Jim Compton","I think as you mentioned obviously a tough year and the biggest, I think I talked about in this way I think the biggest disappointment from my perspective was the revenue, the synergies we faced last year and you know I think expectations I think you can think of one to two points in RASM that we under performed and you know and so my confidence is as John mentioned at close is that given the stability of the operations because I really believe predictability is important, when you\u2019re predictable things just operate so much better across the system and revenue flows with that. So you know we\u2019re excited about 2013 given the initiatives that we have in place and you know we feel that we will certainly close that gap and but we\u2019ll work our way through the year but we\u2019re very optimistic.","John Rainey ","","Mark I would just add to that, this is John. 2013 is clearly a year where we\u2019re focused on execution and proving our operational reliability. We think though that with the route network that we have and efficient fleet, the employees that we have, the results will take care of themselves if we do the blocking and tackling.","Operator","From Wolfe Trahan, we have Hunter Keay","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Congratulations on the second bag fee of Japan I think that\u2019s great news, Jim but I noticed correct me if I\u2019m wrong I don\u2019t think ANA has a second bag fee to the United States so it's two part question, did you coordinate with them you know with regard how the JVs has functioned and if they don\u2019t have a second bag fee for the US, are you just going to collect the second bag fee revenue and just give half to them as they don\u2019t have to necessarily deal with the bad publicity associated with the second bag fee.","Jim Compton","Hunter I won't get into specifics of how that work. I will tell you that obviously we work very closely with ANA, they are a terrific partner and you know the JV has mechanisms to work through all kinds of different things that come up and that\u2019s what we will do working with them but again we\u2019re seeing the JV quite frankly is delivering terrific results as we\u2019re seeing connections over Narita using ANA and also both of us are partnering with each other in the Trans-Pacific.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","And as it pertains to the January PRASM number if you look at the bookings that were up 400 basis points weighted average coming into the month and that was capacity down maybe 400 \u2013 500 basis points. I\u2019m curious to know why the yields came in where they did in January, and is the strategy right now to just to sort of fill the flights and sort of focus on yields as the operational improvement gets better. So you\u2019re just focusing more of load factors in that regard or I guess the real ultimate question is how do yields start to go up again because that\u2019s probably going to have to provide the next leg of PRASM.","Jim Compton","That\u2019s a great question, from my perspective the way I look at it is somewhat as you described, right, I think our challenges last year from the management\u2019s perspective is that we actually manage less flights that we underperformed in load factor and so as that load factor comes in what happens is we begin to manage more flights and [revenue manage analyst] [ph] begin to manage the buckets and so forth. So not talking too much about yield going forward but again as our corporate customers recognize what we\u2019re doing from a reliability point of view as those, as the demand continues to grow we will manage the inventory to optimize that revenue.","Operator","From UBS we have Kevin Crissey online. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","","So is there - can you talk about maybe if not the exact percentages but the progression of capacity, because 2.5% I think is lower than where people would have thought given the capacity cuts for the quarter so maybe there is something unique about January capacity relative to the rest of the quarter if you can talk about that.","Jim Compton","So I think the way to think about the quarter for us that 4.1% to 5.1% down in the first quarter is February even adjusting for leap year will be the most significant capacity cut month followed by not as much but March. So January is the least capacity year-over-year reduction of the quarter.","Kevin Crissey - UBS","And then just looking at the numbers you guys overall, I mean so I would hope that then you would have a pick up from here because if you look at I don\u2019t think your comparisons are more difficult than say U.S. airways or Delta but you\u2019re, there seems to be quite a bit of continued under improvement unless you have a significant pick-up from in February and March given where their guidance is for RASM, is that fair?","Jim Compton","I think again the when I talk about January, one data point for us is January is a little bit more difficult comp for us on a, if we went on a two year over two year just kind of put a framework reference in December we\u2019re 8% up over 2 years that 2.5% represents a beat of that 8% on the two year basis. So any given month I guess it's hard, things can fluctuate and change. I think the investor updates were very feel good about the demand, the booking curve that we see going forward.","","Kevin Crissey - UBS","And I guess similar to Mike\u2019s question I guess, the way I\u2019m thinking is laborers gotten their pay increase. I know they didn\u2019t had in a while but you bought them a car, the pilots a car and then effectively with the amount of back pay and then you\u2019re buying them a car each year in terms of forward pay. The customers are getting a better product hopefully they will get a better operation as we move forward and yet the financial returns aren\u2019t improved, they have diminished. So what I\u2019m trying to understand is whether this is a function of the challenges uniquely to your integration or if you rethink the timing of the synergies overall and whether they are more back loaded the benefits of the mergers in general, thanks.","John Rainey","I think speaking to synergy achievement, we targeted about to achieve 75% of the 1 billion to 1.2 billion last year and we did a good job in terms of other revenue and cost synergies. Those two combined amounted to about $650 million but as I said in my remarks earlier we clearly underperformed from a passenger revenue perspective. We have every bit of confidence that we will achieve the full run-rate of the 1 to 1.2 and we\u2019re actually are optimistic about that. In terms of the timing, getting back to Mike\u2019s question. We love to get that in 2013 but it's also reasonable to assume that that could be a difficult bar and it could slip into 2014.","Operator","JP Morgan we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Jeff you and I sparred a little bit on the last conference call on the subject to pilot costs and to your credit the deal did come shortly thereafter so looking back I respect your decision to remain tight lipped, but you can\u2019t blame me for trying the same approach as it relates to mechanics and flight attendants. So, if we set aside wages, are there any competitor work rules incorporated into the contracts that are already out there that could afford you some greater flexibility or should we simply view this exercise as one of increased expense?","Jeff Smisek","Jamie, we\u2019re trying to make sure that in return for marking the market with wages and the benefits of our co-workers, in return we get good productivity from them and flexibility because this is an industry that requires flexibility and you know we\u2019re making -- very good progress with the IAAM. We\u2019re also making good progress with our teamsters and I hope to be able to announce some new deals as we go forward in time this year.","Jamie Baker \u2013 JPMorgan","Excellent and for my follow-up obviously unit margins lagging those of the industry you know I\u2019d argue and I sense you to agree that the only thing standing between you and margin parity is execution as opposed to being anything structurally wrong with the franchise but as we think about closing the margin gap what are the key drivers, what is the waterfall chart look like. Does fleet optimization drive a quarter of the gap and improve customer service another quarter, sending the management rank a few points do you have to buy an oil refinery, I mean what gets you from where you are today to where you know Delta already is.","John Rainey","I think you know clearly we got to make up a big part of that gap in terms of our revenue performance and some of that will come through corporate shares, some of it will be harvesting the benefits of the mergers through redeployment of aircraft in that nature but we also have a significant opportunity in terms of becoming more efficient., We have attacked some of our operational problems with, call it a blunt instrument and we have thrown head count at it and I think that we can be a lot more efficient. We can better deploy technology, put it in the hands of the customer and I think overtime we can actually see significant savings in other areas on the expense side.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley we have John Godyn online. Please go ahead.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Just a follow-up on some of the questions on closing the margin gap, as you know one of your competitors is very focused on announcing a plan for returning capital to shareholders this year. Once you do close the margin gap it's moving in that direction the next step?","John Rainey","Clearly, we have the aspiration of getting there, I would remind you that Delta is two years ahead of us in their integration and you know that the way that we have framed this internally is I would prioritize as we want to get the operation running like it needs to be and then we want to continue to pay down a lot of the non-aircraft debt, we got a significant amount of non-aircraft debt that\u2019s coming due in the next few years and then I think we can have a very healthy discussion about returning cash to shareholders. Now I would say I don\u2019t think all those have to happen in a serial fashion but clearly in terms of how I prioritize those that\u2019s what it would be.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Jim just a follow-up on some of the PRASM questions which I guess suggest that maybe Jan was a little bit weak, I know you can\u2019t give numbers for all the sort of comps issues but is it fair to say that it sounds like the completion factor that you\u2019re looking at for Jan and shift in Chinese New Year or maybe bringing Jan a little lower than maybe people would have expected and as we look into February certainly again the shift in Chinese New Year the easy comps perhaps depending on how the completion factor fairs and maybe some accounting adjustments are actually going to just naturally create a very big bump to PRASM, is that a fair way kind of framework for thinking about it?","Jim Compton","It is understood John. First of all the completion factor is exceeding our expectations, the operations has been stellar this month from a completion and so we\u2019re generating the ASMs from a completion factor point of view. The second point is on the Chinese New Year\u2019s a little bit is a good point also, a little perspective is January last year we cancelled 25 round trips because of the New Year and TransPac to support what become very much not a business travel period. That is shifted to February and so is a specific capacity you know is running kind of a more normal time with the Chinese New Year been in there. So both of those things affect exactly what you\u2019re talking about.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Okay thanks and I couldn\u2019t help to notice that the advance book factor for the pacific was up meaningfully. Is it fair to say that you\u2019re seeing evidence of some of those easier reacceleration that we might be seeing in other date and other companies we track?","Jim Compton","In terms of leisure in general John?","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","I just mean in terms of traffic levels and demand.","Jim Compton","I think what we\u2019re seeing is kind of ongoing, we\u2019re seeing the ongoing kind of general economic environment that we saw in 2012 and seeing still good demand really in all the booking windows going out.","Operator","From Barclays, we have David Fintzen on the line. Please go ahead.","David Fintzen \u2013 Barclays","You know you mentioned I think as Jim mentioned sort of corporate customers around a bit of detour, I\u2019m curious obviously there is a lot you can do to improve the operation, but if (inaudible) find someone else, how do you make sure they know what you\u2019re doing and the piece of that is if you\u2019re hitting sort of your on-time performance targets, is it really your target that matter or do you think you have to make sure that you are towards to the top of the industry, so you can maybe show a customer who has gone somewhere else that your competitive in terms of the operation. I\u2019m curious how you think about that both in terms of the outreach and in terms of the absolute performance and the relative performance on the on-time side.","Jeff Smisek","It's a combination of things, it's not just the on-time performance and you need to be reliable and different levels of reliability above 80% have diminishing returns, but it's really also -- it\u2019s many different factors, it's also very important as the customer service and which is why we\u2019re focusing so heavily on customer service this year as you know I mean you all fly. A good customer service can take even delayed flight or a flight where there is an issue on-board the aircraft, a broken piece of IFE (ph) or something.","And good service can turn that into a really good flight, you can also have a perfectly on-time flight on a brand new airplane everything works and if you\u2019re not getting good service it's going to be a crappy flight. So you know we\u2019re also focusing very, very heavily on customer service both at the airport, on contact center agents with flight attendants and I think that\u2019s and I think you can see that in our improving customer satisfaction scores and I believe those scores will continue to improve. We have enormous amount of folks on it including we\u2019re going to have a broad-based quarterly bonus program for all of our co-workers based on improvements in customer satisfaction scores.","So we\u2019re going to focus heavily on that and as people fly as the word does get out and we\u2019re significantly better today for sure than we\u2019re in the summer and I believe this time next year we\u2019ll be significantly better than we\u2019re today and with that I would take it over to Jim.","Jim Compton","I think as we mentioned kind of in the comments that the last duty integration put a lot of stress on our employees and our customers. I\u2019ll tell you that in that group of employees that a lot of stress was on with our sales force. And our sales force literally was always out there with our corporate partners and travel managers. The difference is the conversation was a little bit different than what we had hoped for. The conversation was about some of the integration issues and so forth.","What\u2019s happened with the on-time performance in the fourth quarter, the improvements we\u2019re seeing now they have really -- the sales force has always been very present with our corporate travel partners and now what they are doing is again talking about the network, the value of the network that it brings to them, what it can do for them in their travel needs. So I guess the point is how did the awareness that things are back. I think the awareness is driven by the fact that they have the sales force is out there communicating, I mentioned a couple of forms we do with advisory boards but really every day they are calling on their customers and letting them know where we\u2019re are at and how we can help them in their travel needs.","David Fintzen - Barclays","I appreciate that and maybe just a quick one now that the pilot contracts done and you have the scope really on the RJs, and is that something that we should look for reasonably large changes in \u201814 or is that a smaller component trying to get a sense of what your opportunities does that some of these higher labor cost down the road with similar to what Deltas did.","Jim Compton","The new contract as it relates to regional does present us with a tremendous amount of flexibility to be competitive in the 70 seat market. Really, the first phase of this year quite frankly is with the new agreement is being able to redeploy the current 70 seaters that we have across the system to optimize the network, some of the things we talked about in terms of synergies for the first year. But as you\u2019re moving to 2014, then we will be able to kind of take that second phase, but this year will be about using the aircrafts that we have and redeploying, but that contract does create tremendous amount of flexibility for us to be competitive in that space.","Operator","We\u2019ve time for one last question from Evercore Partners, we have Duane Pfennigwerth online. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Just wondering when you think you will be able to expand margins year-to-year with this first quarter CASM guidance, do you think revenue can be good enough to start that process this quarter?","Jim Compton","I don\u2019t want to comment on revenue Duane, I think you know as I alluded to earlier in response to Mike. We\u2019re extremely focused on execution we have a plan, we\u2019re following that plan I think that if we execute on that and we do the things that we\u2019re capable of and you combine that with the product that we\u2019re providing, the network that we have, I think that you will begin to see margin expansion clearly. We wanted as badly as our investors, our employee\u2019s want it and I think that 2013 as I said is an important year for us as we\u2019re beginning to put all these different items in place to enable us to achieve that.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","And then just I will ask one follow-up just in terms of your difference between your first quarter CASM guidance and your full year what are the things that sort of drive that moderation other than just more ASMs?","Jim Compton","You\u2019re right, ASM is a significant piece of that but probably two thirds of the cost guidance in the first quarter or the cost increase is related to labor and that\u2019s simply the anniversary effect of lapping some of the labor agreements of last year, results were put in the place during the year. So labor is a piece of that, the only other thing that I would call out as significant as we have got a higher than normal volume of engine events in our V2500 engines in the first and second quarter. So I would expect maintenance expense related those items will be up $30 million to $40 million each quarter, but that tells often back half of the year we actually see some improvements.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Josh Freed from the Associated Press. Please go ahead.","Josh Freed - Associated Press","Has either Boeing or the FFA given you any guidance at all on when you can expect to get your 787s flying again?","Jim Compton","No.","Josh Freed - Associated Press","Okay and are you, what are you hearing from your pilots on the subject of the 787, Are they seeking any additional safeguards it might be in addition to whatever the FAA comes up with, is there any push back from them at all on 787?","Jim Compton","Look, Josh, safety is obviously very important than and I\u2019m confident that when the regulatory authorities and Boeing working together determine the cause of the battery issues and the [fixed] board that we will implement whatever that fix is under the (inaudible) permit us to fly the aircraft safely again.","So there is no distinction between us and our pilots with respect to safety.","Josh Freed - Associated Press","Very, very quickly, can you put any numbers on the head count reduction? I know you gave in terms of percentage can you say any numbers on the number of people you expect to end up cutting?","Jim Compton","Sure it's over 600.","Operator","From Wall Street Journal, we have Doug Cameron online. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron - Wall Street Journal","Just going up on Josh\u2019s question, Jeff and you won't be surprised, but as often no one is going to buy the 787 from (inaudible) 100% safety\u2026.","Jim Compton","Doug, we\u2019re having a hard time hearing you from this end.","Doug Cameron - Wall Street Journal","I mean this is for Jeff and Jim, obviously the industry is not going to fly the 787 until the industry, (inaudible) 100% confident in safety \u2013so, but how do you and other operators start going about convincing the traveling public if that\u2019s the case?","Jeff Smisek","Once the NTSP, GTSP together and FA work together to [determine causality] and Boeing fixes it or done because look the aircraft is a terrific aircraft and customers love the airplane and I have no doubt that customers will flock back to that airplane as soon as we get it back up again.","But this is a problem that Boeing and the regulatory authorities need to deal with, they should deal with it, we support them, we will give them every bit of assistance that we possibly can because we too want to get the airplane up and flying safely and I\u2019m confident that will occur. I don\u2019t know when that will occur but we will learn more with time.","Doug Cameron - Wall Street Journal","What gives you that confidence though?","Jeff Smisek","Well in terms that they will find a fix, I mean in history.","Doug Cameron - Wall Street Journal","No, the confidence that customers will flock back.","Jeff Smisek","Look it's a terrific airplane, I mean ask anybody who has flown that airplane it\u2019s spectacular and once this particular issue is solved it's solved and it's just a matter of whatever time it takes to solve it.","Sarah Murphy","With that we\u2019re out of time.

Smisek","Thanks, Nene and Sarah, and thank you, all, for joining us on our third quarter 2013 earnings call.","Today, we reported a profit of $590 million for the third quarter, an improvement of 13.5% year-over-year or $1.51 per diluted share. I want to thank all of my co-workers for running a reliable airline and delivering great customer service. I'd also like to thank our customers for choosing to fly United. We appreciate your business.","We also appreciate the positive feedback we've been receiving from you about the significant improvements we've made to our operations, customer service and product.","Although our third quarter earnings marked our highest level of quarterly profits since the third quarter of 2011, our financial performance this quarter did not meet our expectations and fell far short of what we can and should deliver. We are committed to achieving the full potential of United.","As we've said before, our 3 goals for 2013 are to deliver solid operational performance, to deliver great customer service, and to beat our financial plan.","We've made meaningful progress on 2 of those 3 fronts this year, but our financial results remain unsatisfactory. We need to accelerate our revenue growth and improve our efficiency in the coming quarters and years. There are several key drivers for our lower-than-expected passenger revenue results this quarter. The first is related to the demand forecast we input into our revenue management system, which was biased toward accepting too many low-yield bookings early in the booking curve. This resulted in very high load factors and a weak yield mix. Another involves suboptimization of our fleet. A third factor is increased competitive pressure in the Pacific entity, particularly, in China. Jim will explain in more detail these items and the prompt actions we are taking to improve our revenue and yield mix.","We have a lot of work ahead, but our team knows what we need to do to address the revenue and cost issues we have and to accelerate our improvements in financial performance. In a few minutes, I'll turn the call over to Jim and John to provide details on the specific actions we're taking on both revenue and costs. But first, let me briefly update you on our progress on our other 2 goals of delivering solid operational performance and great customer service.","We ran a solid and competitive operation in the third quarter, with a mainline on-time arrival rate of 78.9% and a mainline completion factor of 99.2%. September was our best month of 2013 and our second-best month since 2010 for domestic on-time arrivals, at nearly 85%. Our team's performance year-to-date demonstrates that our operations are, once again, stable and reliable. And with the peak travel season behind us, we can now begin to run our operation with far more efficiency than we have in the past.","We also continue to make progress on our goal of delivering great customer service. This is evidenced by our customer satisfaction scores for September that were 37% higher than they were 1 year ago at this time. In addition, the number of written customer compliments we've received about our co-workers has increased 45% year-to-date. So far, more than 40,000 of our agents and flight attendants have participated in our customer service training program. We've made great progress in customer service and are committed to building upon and improving the skills our coworkers have honed this year. We plan to continue to invest in customer service training and standards, and we believe that great customer service at United can become a powerful competitive differentiator.","During the third quarter, we also made significant progress bringing United's work groups together. In early September, we accepted an integrated seniority list from the Airline Pilots Association. This list allows us to bring together our more than 12,000 pilots to form one pilot group, which will allow us to fully integrate our flight operations. In addition, we offered a recall to all pilots who remained on furlough and are in a good staffing position as we approach the implementation date for the new flight duty time rules of FAR 117 in January of next year.","Also in September, we announced tentative agreements with the International Association of Machinists for joint collective bargaining agreements for the work groups represented by the IAM. These tentative agreements cover 28,000 of our customer service representatives, ramp agents, storekeepers and customer contact center representatives, and are currently in the ratification process. We continue in joint negotiations with our other work groups, as well. Bringing our work groups together is important and we continue to work closely with our unions to reach responsible joint collective bargaining agreements. As we do so, we continue to build our working-together culture, which will help us improve our customer service and, in turn, our profitability.","In addition to investing in our customer service and our people, we are investing in our product with the goal of offering our customers a comfortable, consistent and personalized flight experience every time they travel with United. We've made substantial improvements to our onboard product. This month, we unveiled our new economy seat design, focused on customer comfort, revenue generation and fuel efficiency, all with a sophisticated, modern look. This seat has a slimmer, more ergonomic design, providing more customer comfort while allowing us to improve the operating economics of the aircraft on which it's installed. Over the next few years, our customers will experience this new seat on more than 500 mainline and regional aircraft.","United has the industry-leading portfolio of preferred seating options, including the most extra-legroom economy seats and the most premium-cabin flat-bed seats of any U.S. carrier. We are making strides in modernizing our in-flight entertainment, as well. Today, we have over 115 aircraft flying with Wi-Fi and are installing our satellite-based global Wi-Fi product on our remaining mainline fleet at the rate of about 1 aircraft a day. We're also preparing to launch a new streaming video in-flight entertainment product beginning later this year, which will allow our customers to view a variety of on-demand entertainment options on their own devices.","Our digital channels are critical to our strategy of providing personalized experiences, real-time information and more control over the travel experience to our customers. And during the third quarter, we updated the functionality of our mobile app. In the fourth quarter, we will be launching a significantly enhanced version of our mobile app and I expect that our customers will appreciate its design, functionality and ease-of-use. Our customers can now purchase most of our ancillary products directly through the United app. While ancillary sales through our mobile channel still represent a small portion of our total ancillary revenue, we've seen tremendous growth in this space, with the year-to-date mobile channel ancillary sales having more than doubled year-over-year.","Our improving product aligns with our business-centric global network. Our growing fleet of highly efficient Boeing 787 Dreamliners enables us to fly new routes that would not have been feasible without these aircraft. Thanks to the considerable progress we've made in our operational reliability and our customer service, along with our significant investments in our people, our product, our technology and our network, we were ready in September to launch our new ad campaign centered around United's iconic \"Fly the Friendly Skies\" tagline and Rhapsody in Blue theme song.","Our new ad campaign redefines what it means for an airline to be friendly in our modern era. To our customers, friendly now means being user-friendly throughout the entire travel experience, from shopping and booking, to check-in, to boarding, to in-flight, to retrieving bags. We are working hard to give our customers the operational reliability, customer service, network, convenience, options, technology and product they need to have a consistently enjoyable travel experience and to deliver on our promise of being flyer-friendly. We're also working hard to deliver to you, our shareholders, the financial performance that our strong assets and team of over 80,000 co-workers can generate. Improving our financial results is an absolute priority.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim and John, to go through, in greater detail, this quarter's results and the actions we're taking to improve our future results.","James E. Compton","Thanks, Jeff. I'd first like to thank my co-workers for running a reliable operation and providing steadily improving customer service this quarter. I also want to thank all of our customers for choosing United. We are committed to being flyer-friendly in every aspect of your travel experience.","We continued to improve our on-time performance in the third quarter, with a mainline on-time arrival rate of 78.9%. Our operational performance, relative to our peers, improved with only 1 percentage point of on-time performance separating us from top-tier performance. We're pleased to have recognized our co-workers for their accomplishments this quarter with incentive payouts of $9 million. And this month, we're on track to exceed our on-time arrival goals for another payout in October.","We've seen clear operational benefits from many of the actions we've taken over the last 18 months, all of which contributed to our solid operational results. As we move past the summer peak, our focus has shifted to running a more efficient operation while delivering reliability. We are taking every opportunity to reduce the amount of time it takes to taxi an aircraft into the gate, to bring a jet bridge up to an aircraft to begin deplaning, and to turn an aircraft between flights. We're improving our efficiency through enhanced tools for our co-workers, more powerful self-service technology for our customers and a more appropriate matching of staffing with demand.","Our third quarter consolidated capacity declined 1.1% year-over-year, driven by capacity decreases in the domestic and Pacific entities. Our network planning team continually analyzes new opportunities to redeploy current aircraft to new markets in order to make United even more attractive to our customers and to improve our return profile.","We expect fourth quarter consolidated capacity will increase between 2.5% and 3.5%. Approximately half of this increase is due to our reduced flying as a result of Superstorm Sandy in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect full year 2013 consolidated capacity to decrease between 1.2% and 1.4%.","Moving to our revenue results. Our third quarter total revenue of $10.2 billion reflects many of the improvements we've made in our operations, customer service and merchandising capabilities. Our third quarter consolidated PRASM increased 2.7% year-over-year, which was lower than our original expectations for the quarter. Although we did improve our third quarter PRASM versus 2012, our revenue results were not at the level we expected or deem acceptable.","As Jeff noted, there are several key drivers for our lower-than-expected passenger revenue results. The first is related to the demand forecast we input into our revenue management system. Another involves the suboptimization of our fleet. A third factor is increased competitive pressure in the Pacific entity, particularly, in China. Let me assure you, we are taking aggressive action to fix the causes of our underperformance and, in turn, grow our revenue at a faster rate.","First, we have determined that the demand forecast we were using to manage our inventory underestimated the level of close-in booking demand. That erroneous demand forecast biased our revenue management system to open lower-yield inventory buckets further out in the booking curve. As a result, while we ran very high load factors this quarter, our yield mix was lower than it should have been, had we used a more accurate demand forecast. The impact of this issue intensified in mid-September as we shifted from the more leisure-centric summer period to the fall, when there is more business travel and more close-in booking demand. What's key going forward is that this month we implemented the first of 2 significant recalibrations to the demand forecast we are using for future bookings. The first recalibration adjusted our forecast to shift our booking curves toward more close-in bookings. This will reduce the number of low-yield bookings we accept further out from departure and maintaining of seat availability to maximize close-in higher-yield bookings.","The second recalibration to our demand forecast will occur in November and will update the demand forecast to be more weighted to recent demand trends than prior-year history. Together, these changes will enable us to capture more higher-yielding traffic than we have recently. Since we accept bookings up to 11 months before departure, it will take some time to see the full effect of this recalibration. However, we anticipate realizing accelerating yield improvements during the first half of 2014.","Second, to ensure we minimize any operational challenges during the peak summer travel period, we took a more conservative approach to revenue management by limiting the booking levels we would accept on a given flight. That was the right thing to do then. Today, however, as we are running a consistently reliable operation and have a longer history of booking data and traffic flows across our network, we are moving away from those tactics. We have a more accurate assessment of customer behaviors such as no-shows and cancellation rates across our system, than we did at this time last year, and have adjusted our inventory availability and booking levels accordingly to drive incremental revenue.","Third, while our global route network is the best in the industry, we still have opportunities to optimize our footprint and choose the best aircraft for a particular route. For example, last summer, due to operational reliability issues we were experiencing with our Boeing 747 aircraft, we moved our entire 747 fleet to San Francisco to increase our maintenance touch points and provide better spares and swap capability to minimize operational issues.","While this was not a revenue-maximizing decision in the short-term, it was important that we quickly improve the reliability of the 747 fleet. Now that we have improved the reliability of those aircraft, after putting them through an intensive preventive maintenance program, we're comfortable returning the 747s to their optimal routes. That includes the routes originating in Chicago. We expect this change will drive around $40 million in additional benefit next year.","Although what I have been talking about constitutes just some of the many actions we are taking to improve our passenger revenue, they are among the most critical and impactful ones. I want to assure you, we will remain vigilant and flexible as we implement these actions and will consider others to improve our performance, all while continuing to run a competitively reliable airline delivering great customer service.","We are facing a challenge in the Pacific region. During the third quarter, our Pacific unit revenue declined 9.4% year-over-year, driven by capacity growth from domestic and international competitors in China and by an additional headwind of $55 million in the quarter due to yen weakness. As you know, we are the largest U.S. carrier to China, with more than twice the capacity of our next largest U.S. competitor. Demand for travel to and from China continues to grow at one of the highest rates globally, and in response, there has been a flood of new competitive capacity into that market. In total, in the third quarter, competitive industry capacity between the U.S. and Beijing and Shanghai increased 20% year-over-year, and we see that trend persisting in the fourth quarter.","As we moved from the summer into the shoulder period in September, we saw our yields and load factor on flights to China deteriorate at a rate over and above what we originally anticipated. Despite the year-over-year Pacific PRASM declines, the region remains a critical asset for us and a key differentiator. We operate ideal Pacific gateways in San Francisco and Los Angeles, the 2 largest local markets on the West coast, and offer our customers an unmatched level of service to China. While our offering between the U.S. and Asia is unrivaled, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our presence while maintaining overall capacity discipline.","As you may know, we will soon start selling tickets on our new nonstop service from San Francisco to Chengdu, China. The 787 makes this service viable and enables United to be the first mover among domestic carriers to serve such important markets in Asia.","We're also working to provide our customers a consistent, user-friendly travel experience from end to end. We're doing this by offering great seating options, providing a comprehensive portfolio of ancillary projects -- products, rolling out global satellite Wi-Fi across our mainline fleet, improving our self-service technology and delivering excellent customer service. We now have Economy Plus seating installed on nearly all of our mainline aircraft and on many of our larger regional aircraft. Further, we are the only U.S. carrier to offer flat-bed seats on every long-haul international flight from the U.S.","Ancillary revenue continued to show strong growth in the third quarter, as ancillary revenue per passenger grew 16% year-over-year to over $20 per passenger. Economy Plus upsell was, once again, a primary driver of this growth, increasing 19% year-over-year in the third quarter. We further enhanced our ability to dynamically price Economy Plus in the third quarter by migrating Economy Plus to our merchandising platform, which enables us to easily adjust pricing based on load factors and forecasted demand.","We also saw substantial growth from paid premium cabin upgrades, with a 27% increase year-over-year. With our strong ancillary revenue growth in the first 3 quarters of 2013, we are well-positioned to exceed our 2013 goal of increasing ancillary revenue per passenger by 9%.","We're continuing to invest in the technology our customers want and use. This quarter, we enhanced our mobile apps, which now offer functionality for customers to modify their flight itineraries in the case of a delayed or canceled flight. We've also installed global satellite-based Wi-Fi on more than 115 aircraft to date and are installing the product on about 1 aircraft per day.","Turning to our near-term passenger revenue outlook. Many of the recent pressures we experienced in the third quarter persist in October and the fourth quarter, which is a quarter during which we will also be growing our consolidated capacity between 2.5% and 3.5%. We currently estimate our October consolidated PRASM to decrease between 2.5% and 3.5% year-over-year. This includes an approximately 1.5-point negative PRASM impact due to the government shutdown.","We estimate our fourth quarter consolidated PRASM to be flat to down 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We are working hard to provide our customers the network, the product and the service they desire when they travel. While we're disappointed in our revenue results, we're making the right adjustments and have the right plans in place to address the issues and profitably grow our top line in the quarters and years to come.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Rainey","Thanks, Jim, and thanks to our co-workers for working together to deliver great service and reliability for our customers this quarter.","Today, we reported over $0.5 billion of profit for the third quarter, but our financial results are not yet where we expect them to be.","We're making tremendous progress operationally and in our customer service, supported by feedback from our customers and co-workers. But we now need to translate that into better financial results than we are reporting today. The entire team is working hard to accelerate the achievement of our financial goals.","This quarter, we earned $590 million of net income, resulting in a 5.8% pretax margin, a 0.5-point improvement year-over-year. So far this year, we have increased our pretax margin in 6 of the 9 months and expect our fourth quarter pretax margin to increase year-over-year also.","Our third quarter CASM, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, grew 6.4% versus 2012, at the low end of our guidance range. Our better operational reliability was the primary contributing factor to the improvement in the third quarter CASM versus our guidance. Running a solid operation results in lower overtime expense, maintenance expense and re-accommodation expense. In each successive quarter this year, we have reduced our nonfuel CASM year-over-year increase, and we expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter. We expect our fourth quarter CASM, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, to increase about 1% versus the same period in 2012. And for the full year, we expect it to increase between 6% and 6.5% year-over-year. Our increase in nonfuel unit costs this year will be the high water mark for United and we are targeting an annual nonfuel CASM increase lower than inflation for the foreseeable future.","Running a reliable operation is fundamental to our company-wide cost reduction efforts. In the fourth quarter, our productivity will improve year-over-year. We're investing in tools that will make our co-workers more efficient and provide self-service capabilities to our customers. These investments, among other initiatives, will enable us to further increase our productivity over time and allow our co-workers to provide even better customer service. With better reliability and customer service, we are experiencing lower call volumes to our reservation and service centers, and issuing fewer travel vouchers than last year. Beginning with the November schedule, we've reduced scheduled block times and plan to continue to schedule the airline in a more efficient manner next year.","Importantly, though, our commitment to lowering our costs goes well beyond returning to prior levels of efficiency. This summer, we embarked on a comprehensive company-wide effort to improve the efficiency and quality of everything we do. Improving our fuel efficiency is a top priority and we continue to demonstrate progress in this area. Our third quarter capacity declined 1.1% year-over-year, but our fuel consumption declined 2%. The incremental 1% improvement in fuel efficiency is primarily due to replacing older aircraft with highly efficient new Boeing 737-900ERs and 787 Dreamliners, and we expect this trend to continue as we further improve the efficiency of our fleet.","In September, we reached joint tentative agreements for the work groups represented by the IAM, and these agreements are currently up for a ratification vote with the membership. Earlier this year, we offered eligible employees in those workgroups an Early Out program, contingent upon ratification of the joint collective bargaining agreements. More than 1,000 employees have expressed interest in the Early Out programs and if the tentative agreements are ratified, we will begin the separation process for those eligible employees who choose to be part of the program.","In the fourth quarter, we expect between $730 million and $750 million of gross capital expenditures. During the quarter, we plan to take delivery of 6 new fuel-efficient Boeing 737-900ERs and 1 Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and we expect to retire 12 domestic 757-200s. We expect to end the year with 693 mainline aircraft, 9 less than last year. We make our fleet replacement decisions with the goal of maximizing return on invested capital over the life of the asset. In the case of the 737-900ER and the 787, these are great additions to our fleet that help deliver better returns.","In the third quarter, we continued to install slimline seats and global Wi-Fi on our Airbus fleet. This is part of an initiative to refurbish the interiors of that fleet and improve its profitability. This investment significantly improves the onboard experience for our customers and, at the same time, results in a better return for our shareholders as we defer capital investment. By investing a modest amount of capital in this fleet, we will be able to fly these aircraft years longer than we originally intended.","We ended the quarter with $6.7 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1 billion undrawn revolving credit facility. We made $253 million of debt and capital lease payments in the third quarter. As we continue to pay down debt, our pool of unencumbered assets continues to grow. As of the third quarter, we had approximately $5 billion of unencumbered assets, which includes more than 90 unencumbered aircraft. We expect to make approximately $250 million in debt and capital lease payments in the fourth quarter, bringing our total debt and capital lease payments this year to $2.3 billion.","Our maturity profile for the next 4 years is much lower than the last 4 years, with an average of $1.2 billion in annual scheduled debt and capital lease payments. This reflects the significant progress we've made in improving our balance sheet and reducing our outstanding debt and, as a result, decreasing the financial risk in the business.","We've made progress in improving our financial stability this year, but our financial results do not reflect our full potential. We're committed to expanding our margins each year through both revenue improvements and cost reduction. Our goal is to create economic value each and every year, and the foundation we've laid over the last year positions us well to achieve these goals and push them higher over time. We expect more from ourselves than the financial results we are reporting today and are taking aggressive actions to address the factors that contributed to our financial underperformance. I am confident that we will be able to deliver financial results that provide a better return for our shareholders, a better career for our employees and a better overall product and experience for our customers.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Thanks, John. Our operations, our customer service, our product, our technology, our network and our culture have all clearly improved in 2013, and I'm proud of our team's work to create the airline we are today. We are, however, underperforming financially. We know it and we are fixing it. I look forward to reporting to you on our progress and continuing improvement in the quarters and years to come.","With that, I'll turn it over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.","Sarah Murphy","Thank you, Jeff. First we'll take questions from the analyst community, then we'll take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] From Deutsche Bank, we have Mike Linenberg online.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple questions here. John, I just want to go back just to the commentary you mentioned about the margins in the fourth quarter. So I think you indicated that your pretax margin would be better in the fourth quarter year-over-year. Did you mention -- did you say the same about the operating margin?","John D. Rainey","We've made no comment on the operating margin, but there's not a lot of noise in the non-op area. We gave guidance with respect to what we would expect the mark-to-market hedges to be as of -- the fuel curve as of October 17. So there shouldn't be a disproportionate relationship between the 2.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just the -- I guess, maybe as a clarification on the improvement in the pretax margin, can you give us a sense, I mean, are we -- when we say improvement, are we talking about 10 basis points here or something that would suggest that things are definitely moving in the right direction, something maybe more material?","John D. Rainey","Mike, if you took the midpoint of our guidance, along with Jim's commentary on revenue, that would guide you to something close to breakeven. Obviously, we'd like to see better financial results than that, and we're not letting off the accelerator here. We think that there's opportunity to improve both in the fourth quarter, as well as going into next year. And we're quite optimistic about where we're headed. This is disappointing, in the sense that this quarter we think we should be doing better than what we've reported, but we've got a lot of things identified that we're very encouraged about and confident that we can deliver as well.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, very good. And then just jumping over, just a quick one on labor, maybe this is to Jeff, on the pilots. So we have the seniority integration list done, how quickly will we see the mixing and matching of the pilots across the fleet? And then the IAM vote, when is that taking place? What's the time frame?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Sure. I think you'll see, fairly quickly, the mixing and matching. Recognize that we're not going to do a flush bid. What will happen is as vacancies on different pieces of equipment open, then the integrated seniority list takes over from there in terms of pilots from each former subsidiary bidding into those aircraft. So that takes some degree of time, but that's already occurring and it will begin to occur in November. The -- in terms of the vote, the vote for the IAM will be concluded by the end of this month.","Operator","From Cowen Securities, we have Helane Becker online.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Just on the revenue improvements that you're going to strive for over the next, say, year or so, who takes ownership of that?","James E. Compton","Helane, this is Jim. I take ownership of that. And as I mentioned in my comments, disappointed in our results, but I am -- as soon as we understood the contributing factor, we took that swift action to adjust the forecast going forward. And I described the 2 recalibrations that -- one that we've already accomplished and the second one that -- coming in November, that will take the seasonality more into this year and have recent trends drive the forecast, versus relying on past-year experience.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just can you say -- you said, I think, 1 or 1.5 points due to last year. Did you say whether it was due to Sandy? I mean, due to the shutdown, right? 1.5 points in unit revenue or something? Could you say what the impact on unit revenue in the quarter is going to be as a result of the hurricane? Because I think you're probably impacted more than some of your peer group.","James E. Compton","Helane, so in terms -- just for clarification, the 1.5 points was due to the government shutdown, that affects the October results that I guided to. Hurricane Sandy was approximately 1 point of RASM impact in terms of the hurricane.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","So you guys talked about the suboptimal demand and the yield curve and fleets, but what I didn't really hear, other than the 747 example at SFO, was how do we know if you guys have the right capacity in the right markets? Should we expect to see material shifts in your capacity between hubs? And can you firmly say that all of the hubs that you operate as hubs right now deserve to be hubs?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Hunter, this is Jeff, let me take that question. Every hub has to earn its right to be a hub every day. And that's all I will comment on that.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. So as you talk about closing the margin gap to the industry, can you help me -- I know you gave us some color in terms of CASM inflating at a rate less than inflation. I'm assuming that's about 2%. But can you help me understand how much, on a scale -- on a percentage basis to 100, how much of the margin gap closure next year is going to come from revenue and how much is going to come from costs?","John D. Rainey","Hunter, this is John, I'll take that. I think there is an equal opportunity for both. In addition to the aggressive efforts that Jim is leading up on the revenue side, we've got a significant opportunity on the cost side, and we're going to be rolling out at our Investor Day next month a lot more specificity with respect to what those efforts are. But we talked about, all year long, that we can be much more efficient than what we're doing. And I'll give you an example. We're beginning some efforts to implement lean initiatives in many of the operational aspects of our business. And right now, we're piloting a program in Newark, where we're looking at the ticket counter, as well as the bag areas, in terms of how we can run what is a lean operation. And that's something that you can't do across the board all at once. We'll do this in certain areas, learn from our mistakes and what we can improve upon, and then roll it out to other areas. But this is an example of something that we can do to be much more efficient with respect to our cost structure.","Operator","From Barclays, we have David Fintzen online.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe one for Jim. I just want to get sort of some added color on some of the demand forecasting commentary. I mean, obviously, we've -- Delta had sort of similar problems in the sense that they -- earlier in the year, I think they were holding out for too much inventory and it didn't happen, and they kind of solved that problem and unwound it in a couple of months and it didn't really have this kind of long-lasting or dramatic impact. So I'm -- what I'm not hearing is sort of some structural issues. I mean, it sounds like a lot of tactics to fix these revenue problems. But if I look at a market like Newark, is it just revenue management that kind of explains some of the lagging in, say, Newark RASM? Or are there some structural initiatives that we should be thinking about that roll out into next year that start to address some of these issues in some of these hotspots?","James E. Compton","Hey, David, this is Jim. Now here's how I would think about it or how I think about it. If you took our September PRASM, we underperformed the industry by about 4.5 points. And we also said in our traffic release in September, the results reduced by more than 1 point as we adjusted our estimated yields on certain interline tickets from prior periods. So the remaining gap that -- as it relates to September, was due to the competitive capacity between the U.S. and China and from competitive capacity in the U.S. domestic, particularly in transcon, to your point on Newark, as we've seen the capacity growth, particularly in the LAX-to-Newark and San Francisco-Newark, with the increasing capacity brought in by Virgin America and the lower fares and our capacity to match the demand to that lower fares. So if we kind of -- if you step outside the interline yield adjustment, the early estimates are somewhat weighted between the China capacity and what I'm talking about, the domestic capacity and the forecast.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And the way I think about it, when we go -- so when we take a step back and go sort of prior to September, if we go back and look at some of your summer performance, is that more indicative of the kind of performance we should -- relative RASM performance, we should be seeing as we -- as you get past some of these -- some of the revenue management issues? I mean, I guess, China sounds like it's going to linger for longer. I'm just -- I'm trying to sort of weigh sort of tactics versus sort of structural issues here.","James E. Compton","Yes. I mean -- so we think there may have been modest impact to the summer, prior to -- with the revenue management impact that I'm talking about. But we clearly saw it accelerating in September and made swift actions to adjust for that. We have a really strong network with really key hubs and we have a lot of opportunities to leverage the hubs going forward that we're not capturing today or in the past summer. So what we're focused on here in United is correcting for the challenge we have due to the demand forecast that I talked about, and then continuing to build on the assets that we have, particularly in our key hubs. Examples of that are our recent announcement in San Francisco, for San Francisco to Chengdu, on the 787. We're going to continue to work with our JV partners. If you remember, last year, working with our partner, ANA, we reduced our flying between Narita and Taipei. And this spring, we'll start San Francisco to Taipei. The point being, we have all kinds of examples where we have a lot of opportunity to leverage the network that we have out there and build on our key hubs that we have. So we're disappointed in our performance. We're quickly adjusting for it and we obviously think we're going to build on the steady state that we've seen this past summer.","John D. Rainey","Hey, David, I just want to add to Jim's comments, to his point. Yes, I think people tend to focus a lot on year-over-year results and, particularly, we've seen the -- a little bit of softness in the year-over-year results with -- as it relates to the Pacific. But that continues to be a terrific part of our network. We love our footprint there. And the example that Jim talked about, about expanding to Chengdu from San Francisco, is another way that we'll continue to benefit going forward there.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn online.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, I remember, a few years ago, you made headlines by not taking a salary or bonus until Continental made a profit, which, at the time, was really a big deal. As we look into 2014 and all the goals that we're hearing about today and, I guess, what we're likely to hear about at the Investor Day, what's on the line for you and the team? And how can we have confidence that we're really turning a corner here and we're going to hit these targets?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Well, we have a lot of confidence, John, in what we're going to be able to deliver in 2014 and beyond. And I'm personally really excited about what we can do. We have -- we, as the management team, obviously have a lot on the line because our incentives are performance-based. And those are important to us to hit those targets going forward. And trust me, we've got plenty on the line, and my own stock ownership, I think, has demonstrated that, and my own stock purchases have demonstrated that. I'm a big believer in the future of this company.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And we've heard sort of some incremental kind of ideas for improvement today. Of course, I can imagine that you wouldn't want to steal the thunder from the Investor Day, but when I think about other airlines that have had some hiccups in the past, Southwest, at a time, announced kind of like a $1 billion revenue program. Delta announced, at a time, a $1 billion cost structure improvement program. It seems like $1 billion is the number everybody wants. Should we expect kind of a large program? Is that the way that you guys kind of look at the challenges in front of you, that there is a very large gap here that really needs some structural change? Or is it going to be a combination of these kind of incremental opportunities?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Well, John, look, we have, clearly, some very good revenue opportunities ahead of us, and Jim's been talking about that. There is no question that our costs are too high. And we have significant opportunities to run a quality operation with quality customer service and be far more efficient than we are today. And I'll have -- I'll ask John to talk about our sort of internal project on getting our costs more competitive.","John D. Rainey","John, you're exactly right. And I appreciate that when carriers throw out a lot of these big numbers, that there's a tendency for one to roll their eyes at it and they want to see it in the results. And what we've elected to do is wait to disclose that until we can provide you an opportunity to give you some specificity and transparency into what those initiatives are, so that there's not that jaundiced view of what that number is. But you're right, it's a significant number, it's in the billion-dollar range, and we think that we have that kind of opportunity on the cost side going forward.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jeff, one area of differentiation that I think may explain some of United's return metrics is your philosophy on aircraft, notably, your preference to pay up for the newest and the most fuel-efficient and to reap the operating benefits down the road. But given the availability of slightly used aircraft and also end-of-life options, it's not clear to me that your aircraft CapEx plan actually maximizes return on invested capital. In fact, I don't think that it does. So I'm wondering, as you look around for ideas in addition to what we've heard today, is there any chance that you kind of might revise your thinking on fleet, your philosophy on fleet?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Let me take a piece of that and I'll turn it over to John. I think, Jamie, that, and John mentioned it, I think, in his script, we were going to retire the Airbus fleet that we have, which are 152 airplanes, and we determined that we could make an investment in slimline seats, in bigger bins, in Wi-Fi, streaming video on those airplanes, and make them not only a comfortable airplane for our customers and, actually, very, very -- a very good product, but also, because of the ability of the additional seats -- by adding additional seats through the slimline seats, which are very comfortable seats and good for the passenger, but really improve the operating economics. And we made that determination. So we do, indeed, take a look to make sure that we're confident that our aircraft decisions are [indiscernible] maximizing. But I'll turn any other comment over to John, if you want to say something.","John D. Rainey","Sure. Jamie, I would say that we are not necessarily philosophically opposed to buying older planes at all. In fact, there have been cases in our past where -- you might remember the 757-200s that we acquired several years ago, where it makes sense. It's really done on a fleet-by-fleet basis. If I look at like, for example, the used market for the 737-800 right now, that plane is still priced pretty high, and so we look at this individually. Jeff gave the example of the Airbus fleet, where it absolutely makes sense to keep that fleet longer and utilize it more and not replace it. The opposite of that is a good -- an example would be the 757-200s on the United side that we're replacing with 900ERs. For each one of those planes that we replace, it's an addition of about $2 million to $2.5 million to the bottom line each year. So it's not as if we've got, I think, a huge philosophical difference so much as we think that this, in many times, comes down to the actual aircraft that you're replacing. But it's important for us, and getting to the crux of your question, we want to have metered, disciplined capital replacement in a manner that allows us to eventually be able to return cash to shareholders and de-risk this business.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And for my second question, to Jim, on corporate share in New York. New York has become significantly more concentrated over the last decade, especially on my side of the river. And the facilities at LaGuardia and JFK are no longer third-world in quality. So from my perspective, both as an analyst and a passenger, this represents a structural change that's independent from any underperformance or pressures United might have been experiencing more recently. So as you think of your revenue forecast in 2014, are you modeling for share recapture here in New York? And if so, doesn't that somewhat fly in the face of the fact that, at least east of the river now, I mean, things are better and we don't need to schlep to Newark in order to get a good product the way that, clearly, we had to back in 2005.","James E. Compton","Hey, Jamie. Yes, I agree. It's obviously more concentrated than in the past. The way we approach it is that we are really focused on the share that we have there and maintaining that share premium, which we've done a really terrific job of doing over the course of the last couple of years. Do we think there's opportunity to grow it? Yes. I always want to put it in context, that when we think about corporate share and where we're headed in the future, we also think about it in terms of quality, right? And so our corporate programs are actually running at the highest, what I would call, efficiency rate that we've seen since the merger. In other words, when you would come up with a deal and you work with your partner and we talk about what a discount would be versus what the traffic they're going to give us, people are delivering on it. And the efficiency of those contracts are working. When they're not win-win, we actually feel we have an advantage. We have the advantage of the only true connecting hub in New York, where, that if there's lower-yielding corporate traffic that really doesn't make sense for a corporation that's not going to manage its traffic very well, we have the opportunity to always balance the flow of traffic over Newark with, for instance, higher-yield flow from Europe into the U.S., as well as using our partnership with Lufthansa. Because also in those corporate deals, what we also bring to the table that is really a JV, where we're able to work with our Lufthansa partner, Air Canada partner and so forth, and really bring in an overall deal to the corporation. So the point is, all of those aspects are really talking about quality. And yet, when we look at the numbers, we have -- we see our share premium that we have. But we're always going to -- as we think about, going forward, how do we keep those to be a quality type of corporate deal.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Glenn Engel online.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple questions. One, on the labor front, could you tell us whether there's lots of issues left or just a few big, tough issues left to get this deal done? Second question, on the revenue side. It seems like, every quarter, you have this decent-sized revenue adjustment and I don't really hear that from other carriers. So why do you seem to have these changes in retroactive payments to partner airlines that others don't have? And finally, on the yield management side. I would have thought that if you sold too many seats early, it would have had a bigger impact in the peak months when you -- the extra seats you had at the end, you could have gotten a better yield, than in September when you've got plenty of extra seats to sell. And so if you sell seats too early, it's much less of a risk, yet you seem to feel that you had a bigger impact in September from that.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Glenn, let me take the labor question and I'll ask Jim to answer the other 2. I'm not quite sure what you mean by big issues. We have the pilots done, the IAM is out for vote right now, that's 28,000 folks, pilots are 12,000 folks. The 2 big groups we have are -- left are tech ops, our maintenance folks represented by the Teamsters, and our flight attendants represented by the AFA. We're in negotiations with both of those workgroups. In any kind of negotiation, it's hard to know a specific time in which you're going to get a deal. And that's just a matter of the negotiations and timing and all kinds of things. But we're -- I think we're making good progress. I'm confident we'll reach deals, it's just very hard to know when. Now recognize that in both those cases, both of the sides from the former subsidiaries, the old Continental and the old United, they have contracts and they have new contracts, so that's not really the issue.","John D. Rainey","Glenn, this is John. With respect to the revenue adjustments, I'll hit that really quickly then turn it over to Jim. This issue in the last quarter was really something that related to agreements that we have with -- interline agreements we have with other partners. And, a lot of times, there's a certain type of fare that they will sell which we don't have transparency into, and we have to make an estimate about what that yield is on that ticket. And this was simply a case of our estimate was too high and we adjusted it after the fact. That said, we certainly appreciate and desire to have less volatility in some of those estimates and it's something we're striving for, going forward.","James E. Compton","And Glenn, this is Jim. As it relates to the impact in the past versus what we're seeing now, we obviously saw the issue -- mix change for us very quickly as we moved into September. From a revenue management perspective, you're always providing an input to the forecast. And what we have found is that the input to the forecast that was related to what we would've expected in the fourth quarter, basically, was erroneous. And so we put that input into the system, and that erroneous input drove us selling inventory earlier than we otherwise needed to, based on what would've been the close-in bookings coming into the fall. So at this point, that's where we've seen the biggest impact, and it accelerated into September. And that's the piece that we've reacted to and adjusted, based on the 2 recalibrations that I've talked about.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions]","From Wall Street Journal, we have Susan Carey online.","Susan Carey","I'm just wondering, in your special charges in the latest quarter, you have $34 million due to recent potential adverse developments in certain legal matters. Could you just tell me a little bit more about what that is?","John D. Rainey","Yes, Susan. This is John Rainey. That is something that is related to a litigation dispute that arose back during the bankruptcy time period with United, and it's an estimate about that.","Susan Carey","Can you be a little bit more specific?","John D. Rainey","Unfortunately, I cannot on this matter, Susan.","Operator","From the Associated Press, we have Josh Freed online.","Josh Freed","You mentioned that you're working on doing faster turns and shorter taxi times and that kind of thing. Can you give more specifics on that? I mean what kinds of things are you changing to achieve those goals?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Josh, let me give you -- this is Jeff. Let me give you an example. Right now, when you have aircraft arrive at the gate, it's very important that the area be cleared, the aircraft be marshaled in promptly. You don't want to have things like something in the way or the jet bridge driver not there to meet the aircraft. There's nothing more frustrating to -- well, there are things that can frustrate passengers in various ways, but nothing that frustrates me, personally, more than when the aircraft arrives and the jet bridge driver isn't there and the jet bridge doesn't meet the aircraft within our 120-second requirement, that's our internal requirement. Well, we're doing -- we're focusing much more heavily on that because every minute counts in on-time performance, and every minute counts in making sure that you're minimizing misconnects of passengers, that you're having good utilization of your assets, that you're satisfying your customers, that you're getting them to their destinations on time or their connections on time. So we're focusing on lots of what you might view as small tactical elements. But when you put them together, that has -- they result in running a really good on-time operation, which results in not only far better customer satisfaction for your customers, but also decreases your costs. Because you have just much lower costs in terms of re-accommodating passengers, overnight accommodation for passengers, all sorts of things that -- and more maintenance touch time for the airplanes, which means you have much more reliability and schedule reliability, as well. So these are all important things to do, we're keenly focused on them. And you've seen the results in our on-time results. We have materially improved our on-time and our consistency of performance and consistency of reliability. And you also see it in our materially increased customer satisfaction scores. We're doing just a terrific job improving customer service. And you're going to see us continue to do that in the future.","Operator","And from Bloomberg News, we have Mary Schlangenstein online.","Mary Schlangenstein","I wanted to ask if you could provide any specifics on what the maintenance issues were, and the reliability issues, with the 747s?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Yes, I'll speak briefly to that. Look, the 747s were aircraft that were good solid, safe airplanes. But the old United had under-invested in what I would call preventative maintenance. That is, looking at the data and determining what things were causing maintenance issues with the aircraft fleet repetitively. And what we've been able to do is to take those aircraft and put them through a check cycle for preventative maintenance. It's fixing things before they break and predicting which things can break, which would cause an aircraft to be delayed. And recognize, when a 747 has a maintenance issue, that's typically a pretty high-profile event because there are hundreds of passengers. Typically, those aircraft are flying very long distances and they can break in foreign destinations, so it's really important to have reliability. So what we did with those airplanes is we concentrated them all in San Francisco, where we have terrific technicians and have really, really a solid maintenance base there. And that permitted us to not only put them through the preventative maintenance, but to have lots of technicians there to assist us, to have lots of parts there and to make sure we had good swap opportunities as well. Now that clearly was not revenue-maximizing in the long term, but in the short term, it was important for us to return those aircraft to reliability. We've done that now and we have the confidence in those aircraft today to start flying them where they really want to fly, for example, out of Chicago, versus necessarily all concentrating in San Francisco. We're also, Mary, investing in those aircraft. Those are aircraft -- in fact, we've got a prototype streaming-video aircraft up and running right now. We're putting power throughout that aircraft and streaming video and global Wi-Fi. This is going to be a terrific product for our customers when we're done with it. So we're excited about what we've been able to do with the 747. And it's really important for us, from a maintenance reliability and, certainly, from a customer-satisfaction perspective.","Sarah Murphy","Okay. We're out of time now, so we'll conclude.

I am certainly darn glad to be here and I look forward to reengaging with all of you across all our stakeholder network. But today, let me start frankly by extending my thanks for all the well wishes I have received from across my United family during my situation. I am pleased to report that I feel great. My recovery is progressing very nicely. Already this week, in fact, over the course of the last month, I am beginning to participate in meetings and certainly plan to increase my involvement each week going forward. As far as expectation of full return, I certainly will be back full-time by the end of the first quarter, if not sooner and I am incredibly energized by that prospect. So again, I look forward to seeing all of you out on the road.","As I am thanking people, I want to thank Brett and my entire United team for their excellent work and implementing our shared purpose and vision for United. We really have made significant progress in both our operation and our financial performance. I am frankly excited to be here today that we announced record profits for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. And this I tell you could not have been done without the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that exist with our frontline employees. I am very proud of what they do each and everyday and we are going to leverage and use this increased level of engagement to continue the momentum into 2016 and beyond.","So, with that, let me turn the call over to Brett.","Brett Hart","Thanks, Oscar and thank you all for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. The entire United family is very pleased to have Oscar in the room with us today. And like him, we are all looking forward to his full-time return. In the meantime, I and the management team want to thank our employees for making 2015 a great year for United. We achieved record financial and operational performance, made meaningful strides towards enhancing the customer experience and this fall we committed to continuously earning the trust of customers and employees. While we are \u2013 while we still have more work to do, I am proud of the tangible measures of success we have already demonstrated, none of which could have been accomplished without the hard work and commitment from the entire United team. Over the last 3 months, I have visited each of our hubs and I am consistently impressed by our employees\u2019 enthusiasm, dedication and strong desire to win and it is an honor to work alongside them as we take the next steps toward improving United.","Today, we reported 2015 pre-tax earnings of $4.5 billion, our highest level of earnings in United\u2019s history. I am pleased to announce that through our profit sharing program, employees will be able to share in the success as we pay out $698 million, our largest distribution ever. For the year, we achieved a return on invested capital of 21%, also marking the highest ROIC ever reported by United. These numbers represent a meaningful improvement year-over-year as well as progress closing the gap in financial performance of our two closest competitors.","A major contributor to our strong financial performance is the improvement in our operation. When compared to last year, our completion rate improved by more than 1 point and on-time performance was 6 points better for the full year 2015. This was particularly evident in the fourth quarter as our on-time performance and completion factor were the best since the merger. A well-run operation is a top priority for customers and we are working extremely hard to become the consistently reliable airline our customers can depend on.","We also want to be a great place to work for our employees. We have a responsibility to provide them with contracts they deserve. And this fall, we made significant progress to do just that. Evidence of this progress can be found in the two new agreements covering our pilots and technicians that are currently in the ratification process. Additionally, we reached an agreement to open negotiations on new contracts for our airport and customer service work groups, more than one year in advance of the amendable dates. We are also continuing negotiations with our flight attendants and are hopeful that we reach an agreement with them this year. I want to thank these union groups for their commitment to reaching agreements that will lead our workforce in the years to come.","I am pleased with the progress we made in 2015. We took significant actions that have led to both strong financial and operational performance. We are excited for the opportunities in 2016 as we focus on making the changes necessary to become the airline that we, our customers and our shareholders expected to be.","Now, I will turn it over to Greg.","Greg Hart","Thanks, Brett and thank you to everyone for joining the call this morning. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their efforts this year, particularly during the busy holiday travel season. As Brett mentioned, we have made meaningful improvements to our operation and we couldn\u2019t have done it without the continued hard work and dedication of our employees. Due to the great work of the United team in 2015, we had the best on-time arrival performance since the merger. Additionally, we had a better completion rate than our network competitors in both New York and Chicago and better completion in Houston than our network competitor in Dallas.","We also continue to deliver well on bag performance. In fact, during 2015, we achieved record bag performance for 7 of the 12 months in the year. As reflection of our commitment to operational excellence, we recently launched a new United Global Performance Commitment for corporate customers in 2016. With this program, we will compensate eligible corporate accounts if we fail to meet our operational targets for the year. This clearly demonstrates our level of confidence and commitment to continue to improve United\u2019s operational performance.","Looking forward to 2016, we have a number of opportunities to further improve the operation. One change we implemented earlier this month was an increase in the amount of out-and-back flying we do. Said differently, we are increasing the amount of flying that begins at a hub and then travels to another station before returning directly back to the originating hub. In 2015, approximately 35% of our flights followed an out-and-back pattern. At the beginning of this year, we transitioned to approximately 70% of our flights that now follow this pattern, although which is more consistent with that of our peers.","This does two things for us. First, it dramatically reduces the complexity of the operation. In addition, it helps to isolate the impact of weather and aircraft control related events to the impacted hub while mitigating the impact on our other hubs. We believe that reducing this complexity and limiting the impact of weather on our operations will drive improved reliability and efficiency and provide a better experience for our customers and our employees.","In closing, I want to thank the entire operations team for all their hard work in 2015. I am proud of the significant progress we made this year and I look forward to building on these successes in 2016.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Compton","Thanks Greg. I would also like to thank our customers for their business in 2015. As Brett indicated earlier, we want to be our customers\u2019 first choice on every trip they take. And we will achieve this by continually building their trust. Accomplishing this won\u2019t be easy and won\u2019t happen overnight, but the entire team is committed to this goal. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined 6%. The four primary factors we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our revenue performance as expected; strong U.S. dollar, the effects of lower oil prices, pressure as a result of margin accretive initiatives and competitive pricing actions. However, we also faced some unanticipated headwinds during the quarter. First, the attacks in Paris put pressure on bookings across the Atlantic during the weeks that followed the event. Second, our strong operational performance resulted in more completed flights than initially planned. While this is beneficial to margin and excellent for our customers, the additional capacity provided a tailwind to unit costs, but a headwind to PRASM. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw oil prices continue to fall. We have provided incremental pressure to our Houston hub and corporate energy business, while ultimately being a tailwind to our fuel expense and overall earnings. Finally, demand declined throughout the quarter as demonstrated by downward revisions to fourth quarter GDP expectations.","Turning to the first quarter, we expect our unit revenue to decline approximately 6% to 8% year-over-year with domestic PRASM down approximately 4% to 6% and international PRASM down approximately 8% to 10%. The major drivers for the first quarter revenue performance are expected to be largely the same as the fourth quarter. For the consolidated system, we expect foreign exchange impacts will account for 1 point of year-over-year PRASM pressure. Given further decline in oil prices, we anticipate continued pressure from lower surcharges, particularly in Japan which we expect will account for approximately 1 point of weakness. Lower oil prices have reduced revenue from our corporate energy customers and we are also beginning to see a decline in revenue from the broader non-energy Houston market. The combined revenue pressure from both these energy contracts in the Houston hub is anticipated to be approximately 1 point. Finally, we also expect the current competitive pricing actions will drive approximately 1.5 points of decline in the quarter.","As we have mentioned before, while PRASM is an important metric, there are other metrics at United that are equally or even more important, principally profit margin and earnings. As we construct our network and deploy our assets across it, our primary goal is to increase earnings and margin. To that end, there are certain decisions that may be dilutive to unit revenue, but margin accretive for the business. Over the next several years, we have specific initiatives in place that may have just that effect. Our up-gauging initiative is one such example. Our reducing departures and increasing the average gauge of our airplanes, we will grow our capacity very efficiently, which will be a tailwind for CASM while putting pressure on the PRASM performance. I would add that in the case where we replace the single cabin 50-seat aircraft with the two cabin regional small mainline aircraft, there is additional revenue that we can generate from having Economy Plus and First Class seats. In 2016, we anticipate increasing our average gauge by approximately 5% and reducing our average departures by approximately 1% compared to 2015.","Another opportunity to grow earnings comes from further improvements to our pricing and segmentation capabilities. As we have seen in 2015, this has become an increasingly important component to revenue management. The more we segment our fares, the better opportunity we will have to minimize revenue dilution. The first phase is the rollout of our bundled fare offerings this month. This allows customers to purchase the collection of products suited to their travel as opposed to a more manual process of selecting from an \u00e0-la-carte menu. The second phase, which we expect to launch in the second half of this year, will complement this bundled structure by introducing an entry level fare that will appeal to the purely price sensitive customer. We believe this slate of offerings will allow further segmentation across United\u2019s customer base, while also avoiding some levels of revenue dilution built into our pricing structures today.","Another way we intend to improve our revenue performance is through continuing to improve the reliability of the operation. Reliability is a top priority for our customers. And over the last several years, our revenue has suffered from the inconsistency in our operation. As Greg mentioned, the operation has made significant strides forward and we expect over time for this to generate additional revenue. Earning the trust of our customers is critical for long-term earnings improvement and the great work from Greg and his team are cornerstone for that success.","With respect to capacity and as a result of reduced trans-Atlantic flying, we reduced our expectations for the first quarter capacity and now anticipate growing approximately 1.5% to 2.5%. For the full year, we still expect to grow 1.5% and 2.5%. As we all know, there are certain pockets of the globe that are experiencing economic slowdowns. We are thoughtfully addressing these issues by repositioning capacity to the areas that are experiencing the most economic growth. An example of this is what we are doing in Houston. Due to the decline in the energy business as we have discussed, our Houston hub has experienced significant yield pressure. Consequently, we are shifting capacity away from Houston and into other growing markets like Denver and San Francisco. We will remain disciplined in allocating our capacity in the markets that will generate the highest profitability. In conclusion, we are continuing to implement margin accretive initiatives, product improvements and other initiatives across the commercial organization to attract and retain more high value business customers. In 2016, we anticipate sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement and expect that the actions we are taking, along with an improving operation, will further earn the trust of our customers.","With that, I will turn it over to Gerry.","Gerry Laderman","Thanks Jim. I would also like to thank our employees for helping to make 2015 a record year for United. Their hard work led to our success this year and I know they will bring the same energy and dedication to our efforts in 2016. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $934 million or $2.54 per share excluding special items. This is double what we earned in the fourth quarter of 2014 and marks the seventh straight quarter of record earnings. For the full year 2015, we reported $4.5 billion of net income or $11.88 per share excluding special items and we achieved the pretax margin of 11.9%, a 6.8 point increase versus last year and the highest in United\u2019s history.","Disciplined cost management has been the key contributor to our results this year. For the full year, our unit costs excluding fuel, profit sharing and third party expenses decreased 0.7%, more than 1 point lower than our initial 2015 guidance, despite nearly 0.5 point of capacity reduction from our original plans. As Jim mentioned, our up-gauging strategy was a meaningful contributor to our CASM performance in 2015 and we expect this contribution will continue as we ramp up the program through 2019. Looking forward to 2016, we expect our CASM, excluding the impact of new labor deals to increase approximately 1%. The new labor agreements with our pilots and technicians, currently open for both, would add approximately 2.5 points of CASM for the year. This is consistent with our commitment to maintain CASM growth below inflation over planning cycles. 2 years ago, we set a goal to achieve $1 billion in annual non-fuel savings by 2017. We now expect to achieve this goal in 2016, a full year in advance of our original timeline. This focus on continuous improvement and durable savings will not end as we still have opportunities to improve efficiency and manage costs prudently.","Turning to fuel expense, for 2016 we are 17% hedged and are in a loss position of approximately $225 million. Our portfolio allows us to participate in 98% of any future declines. We are currently evaluating the structure of our hedge program. And in the meantime, we have not added any new hedges since July 2015. Based on the guidance we have provided for cost and revenue in the first quarter of 2016, we expect our pre-tax margin to be between 8% and 10% in the first quarter.","Moving on to cash flow, in 2015, we generated $6 billion of operating cash flow and $2.5 billion of free cash flow. In deciding how best to allocate capital, I would also look at cash flow net of aircraft financing, since the decision to lease versus purchase an aircraft can have a material impact on the traditional calculation of free cash flow. When incorporating proceeds from long-term aircraft financing, we generated over $4 billion in adjusted free cash flow for 2015. I am pleased that we continue to generate significant cash flow in excess of both what we need to run our business and what we need to secure our future.","Taking all that into account, in the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $520 million repurchasing United stock, about double the amount we spent in the prior quarter. For the full year 2015, we spent $1.2 billion in the share buyback program. Looking forward, I expect that we will spend at least $750 million repurchasing stock in the first quarter and now plan to complete our current $3 billion program substantially earlier than originally anticipated.","One of the tools we use is the 10b5-1 plan, which allows us to purchase stock throughout the quarter even during periods when we might otherwise be unable to be in the market. As an example, we purchased shares on every trading day so far this month. We also used our cash to fulfill one of my primary missions of ensuring that we continue to make all appropriate investments in our business. In 2016, we expect to spend $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion for capital investments, including approximately $1.1 billion of non-aircraft CapEx. This would be roughly $100 million more than 2015 for non-aircraft CapEx. This increase is driven almost entirely by incremental technology investments. We believe that further investment in our technology is critical for our ability to compete in the years to come.","We also expect to invest approximately $1.7 billion on our fleet in 2016. We plan to take delivery of 14 737s, 5 787-9s, our first 777-300ER and 9 used A319s. We will also add 40 Embraer E175s to our regional fleet. Our fleet investments this year also included pre-delivery deposits associated with the order we announced today for 40 737-700 aircraft to be delivered beginning mid-2017. As we have stated in the past, we are continuing to shift more flying towards the mainline operation as our regional flying is being reduced. It is our expectation that our current seat of approximately 250 50-seat aircraft will be reduced by more than half by the end of 2019. While this new 737 order does provide replacement capacity to partially offset the reduction in the regional operation, we are continuing to pursue additional aircraft to continue up-gauging and meet our capacity plans.","We are also utilizing our cash to continue to secure our future. In 2015, we prepaid $1.2 billion of debt, including $300 million in the fourth quarter. As of the end of the year, our gross debt balance, including capitalized operating leases, was $17 billion, $1.1 billion less than the end of the prior year.","In 2015, we also contributed more than $800 million to our pension plans. And as of year end, our unfunded pension liability is now $1.5 billion, a $700 million reduction from the prior year. As we head towards well-funded status for our pensions, we anticipate contributing approximately $400 million to our pension plans in 2016.","In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for United as seen in nearly every financial metric. Moving into 2016, we look forward to delivering strong earnings performance and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation. I believe that the investments we are making in our people and our product will lead to a strong future that will benefit our employees, customers and investors.","I will now turn it back over to Jonathan.","Jonathan Ireland","Thank you, Gerry. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Jonathan. [Operator Instructions] From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi on line. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jim, just on your comments around demand weakening through the quarter kind of tied to the revisions to GDP. So, are you seeing that show up in forward bookings? And does the guidance for first quarter assume that demand continues to weaken from here or that kind of starts to stabilize at some point?","Jim Compton","Hey, Joe, this is Jim. As you look at first quarter, our guidance is obviously based on the information that we have today both a yield perspective and a booking perspective. What I would say is that the pressures that we saw in the fourth quarter, which are mainly yield, continue in the first quarter. So, we see strong demand. I have to always separate a little about what Houston and the energy, there are certain sectors that in high-yield demand we are seeing weakness. But overall, our bookings, both factors look where they were last year in terms of the load factor point of view. It\u2019s the yield pressure that we see in the first quarter.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then Gerry, just on the profit sharing accrual in first quarter that\u2019s I think about 60% higher than first quarter on a much less increase in op income. So, have there been any changes to that just based on some of the new labor contracts or how should we think about in 2016?","Gerry Laderman","There have been some minor changes. For example, we added a layer for our M&A employees at 10% over a certain threshold. Other than that, it\u2019s pretty similar.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, thanks.","Operator","From Cowen & Company, we have Helane Becker on line. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Oscar, welcome back. Do you guys ever release or tell us and this is probably for Jim, what percent of the cabin, the front of the cabin is being sold versus used for upgrades?","Jim Compton","Hey, Helane. We haven\u2019t released that. It\u2019s one of those we have talked about in the past growing our pay versus load factor and we continue to do that. I will tell you we are also focused on making sure that we keep that in balance with our loyalty customers. There is a lifetime value with our MileagePlus customers. That\u2019s very important to the overall economics as we go forward. So, it\u2019s a balance. And so internally, we continue to debate what that is, whether it\u2019s pure products to offer to get into the first class, lower price points in first class, but also balancing that with the upgrades to our loyal customers.","Oscar Munoz","Helane, this is Oscar. Let me just add my suspicions. As I traveled on our network and system, I spent a lot of time on our aircraft and spent a lot of time with some of our high-value customers and that is a particular sore subject with them. And so that balance that Jim speaks about, I think is a very important one that we have to strike.","Helane Becker","Okay. Thanks very much, gentlemen. Those are really all my questions for now.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Good morning. So Gerry, it\u2019s nice to see the buyback pick up and thank you for the update. But if we assume you guys have significantly more cash of which to dispose this year, which I am putting at about $6 billion to $7 billion factoring in pension contributions, assumptions around finance CapEx and maybe a little bit of excess cash, should it be a fairly obvious decision to make that the level of buybacks this year exceeds your capital spending given the immediate accretion that you get to EPS, not to mention the signal you will send to your long-term shareholders about the trajectory of earnings beyond this year?","Gerry Laderman","Hunter, that\u2019s a good question. Let me talk about capital allocation generally, just as sort of set the stage. We have really the three components to it. So we are very focused on making the investments we have to make. To paraphrase an old friend of mine, I know what happens when you take the cheese off the pizza. So we will, first and foremost, make the right investment, but they have to drive the value that we expect or we would stop making some of them. Let me turn to the balance sheet and in securing the future, we are in a pretty good spot with the balance sheet, so I would not anticipate the level of debt prepayment that you have seen in the past. Having said that, the way we will continue to manage the balance sheet is through the amount of new aircraft financing. So I would expect this year to finance some, probably not all of the aircraft this year and that\u2019s going to potentially leave some cash. I would say first and foremost, I want to see that cash before I spend the cash. But as we continue to manage our cash sort of down to the target range that we feel comfortable with, that sort of $5 billion to $6 billion of liquidity that we have stated as sort of comfortable target range, there is absolutely the opportunity for additional cash in the buyback. And as I have said in my comments, that $750 million is the minimum, so we will continue to have this dialogue through the year. But I hope you are right. I hope that this is a year that generates those significant cash flows.","Oscar Munoz","Hunter, if I can just \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind, if I can just weigh in on that subject as well. I think if you check my history, you will see the willingness to allocate capital to shareowners in a very broad and distributed way, I don\u2019t think that changes with regards to this. I think it would be at least up sort of qualifier to 750 was added on purpose. And I don\u2019t necessarily disagree with the premise and thesis behind the concept, but we do have to strike a balance. And so this is one of the places where I have been engaged to a little bit and we will keep them more increasingly engaged and you will get more definitive direction in about two months on that going forward.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Yes. I know, Oscar, I am glad you are here because you do have a bit of a reputation of being a capital deployer, so I think it would be helpful for everybody, including your owners, who have been sweating out a pretty difficult year. It\u2019s very hard to buy an airline stock. It is very hard to do that I mean as an investor. And a lot of your owners feel like it\u2019s kind of been sort of hung out to dry a little bit. So I think you would go a long way Oscar if you would commit that barring any sort of major change in the environment, which is I think an easy enough for you to make right here on this call to come out and say barring no major changes in the economy or anything like that exogenous that we will spend more buying back stock than we will on capital spending this year, I think that would go a long way if you would be willing to make that commitment here today?","Oscar Munoz","We are going to look \u2013 we are going to spend a lot of time with our shareholders directly and individually and discuss all their viewpoints and we will make proper public commitments as we see fit. But again, history does tend to repeat itself and I am very excited to get back into this conversation and debate because it\u2019s a great one. Thanks Hunter.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thanks for your time.","Operator","From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie on line. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time here. One quick housecleaning question, what were the NOLs at the year end 2015?","Brett Hart","About $9 billion.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. And so I guess just kind of extrapolating forward, is perhaps 2018 the first year you might conceivably become a taxpayer, if that\u2019s the case or should we think about cash taxes sooner than that?","Gerry Laderman","So I can tell you that we are working hard now that we are in a mode of booking taxes and seeing a future of being a tax \u2013 cash taxpayer. And we were doing some good tax planning. I don\u2019t want to at this point tell you when we anticipate being a cash taxpayer. Obviously, that depends on future earnings, but it\u2019s reasonable to anticipate if the earnings trends continue, you would see a relatively rapid utilization of those NOLs.","Dan McKenzie","I see, okay. And then as a follow-up question here, this one is for Jim. You mentioned sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue improvement, which I believe was on business travel spend. And so is the right way to think about that is 20% of the passenger revenue getting sequentially better each quarter and the reason for the clarification here is we do have some FX headwinds and some competitive headwinds, so I am just trying to reconcile the comment with other revenue externalities?","Jim Compton","Hi, Dan. There is a couple of things happening as you think about 2016 and as we move through the year. You touched on a couple of them just now. But currency, obviously is a big driver of what we look going forward. So kind of where currencies are at today, we would begin to lap some of the currency effects in the second quarter this year. When you look at things such as surcharges and as you know over the past year, we have talked a lot about surcharges particularly in Japan that by law are tied to where oil trades. We will begin to lap those pretty significantly in the third quarter of this year. But again, there are still some sort of charges out in Japan that most recently have come down, so the full effect of that will be more towards the end of the first quarter of 2017. Pricing \u2013 the competitive pricing actions we have talked about through the year, based on where they are at today, we will begin to lap those in the third quarter of 2016. And then lastly oil, we have reported on our corporate energy portfolio through the year being down 20% in the first quarter, 30% in the second quarter, 35% in the third quarter and we saw it drop to 40% in the fourth quarter. So that lapping, given where the current oil prices are and the expectations that oil prices will stay low longer, that lapping affect will take longer than what we have talked about in the past. All being said, there are things that as we lap through the year are \u2013will have less headwind on our RASM performance and that\u2019s why we have talked about quarter-to-quarter improvement based on the factors I described. Always qualify it because as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw GDP expectations come down from our initial expectations, so that and the volatility of oil prices is still that one thing that we don\u2019t like to talk about as specific. But I think given what we have see lapping during the year, we feel good about quarter-over-quarter improvement as we move through 2016.","Dan McKenzie","Okay, very good. Thanks for that perspective.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg on line. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Yes. Hey. Good morning everybody and welcome back, Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you.","Michael Linenberg","I mean to start off, maybe to Jim. Jim, you guys are the biggest carrier to China and we have seen a more significant devaluation of that currency over the past few months, is there anything just given your footprint in that market, are you seeing anything, anything on the trends. And I would sort of say that within the context of some of your commentary about the revenue weakness you talked about yield softness in the international markets as well as domestic and I didn\u2019t know if you were calling out China or other markets in total, what\u2019s \u2013 can you address that?","Jim Compton","Hey, Mike. I think there are things that are getting to us obviously Houston that I have talked about already. And as you mentioned our exposure to China, I would tell you, demand in China continues to grow at the pace of industry capacity. We have seen a little bit lower yield, but we are actually seeing \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s been very profitable for us and that profitability maintained. So from the demand perspective, we are seeing demand keep pace with the capacity that we have talked about over the past several quarters. Again in the first quarter, we see about 19% industry capacity from China to the U.S., but yet we are also seeing bookings for the industry going at that rate. You put that with our strength in San Francisco, the best gateway to Asia, we feel really good about our current position and quite frankly long-term position for China going forward.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. And then just the second question, when you look at your overall revenue performance and you compare yourself versus notably the other big two, American and Delta and you have looked at yourselves on even unit revenue basis. I appreciate the fact that obviously there are some initiatives that you are pursuing that are obviously margin accretive and ROIC accretive and therefore one consequence is that they may be RASM or PRASM dilutive. But I think there is another view out there, at least the perception that maybe strategically you are falling a bit behind your peers and whether it\u2019s on the alliance front or the joint venture front, you look at some of the announcements and some of the relationships and how some of your competitors have grown those relationships. And yet when you look at United, you have a strong \u2013 or at least I believe you have a strong relationship with Lufthansa and you have a good relationship with Air China and you also have a relationship with ANA. But a lot of times, we don\u2019t hear much commentary on it and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s showing up in the numbers. I mean, is that perception real or are there things that over the next year or so that you plan to roll out that maybe will help mitigate some of those revenue sort of differences?","Jim Compton","Hey, Mike. Well, a couple of thoughts. One is you mentioned Lufthansa in the Trans-Atlantic, which was a terrific partner for us and the performance in the fourth quarter, albeit down in the 2% RASM decline was really industry-leading performance \u2013 and our relative performance in the Trans-Atlantic is our peers. We have widened our RASM premium versus our peers in that. That\u2019s with the great work of our team in terms of seasonally balancing the network, and quite frankly, working very closely with Lufthansa. So, that JV for us, in that particular, is obviously very much forward. It goes back into the 1990s relationship. And so we have had great success in that. If you look \u2013 and so \u2013 and then if you look at the Pacific, which is really a growth market for us, ANA plays a big part of that and that relationship from a JV, a little bit younger, but we have made great strides and we have talked about some of the Tokyo when you are flying to places in Asia that we now connect into ANA, which has allowed us to grow our San Francisco hub long-haul. So, I think we have used the JVs to help leverage our market and grow our relative performance both in the Trans-Atlantic as well as into Asia. Recently, our investment and our commercial agreement with Azul, although Brazil is the challenged market right now over the long term, we think that\u2019s going to play terrific. And it\u2019s already generating connecting traffic at numbers that are exceeding our expectations, albeit at lower yields given what\u2019s happening in Brazil as well as the currency situation. So, I think we are very focused on the alliance side to make sure we have the right partners to extend our network and we will do it in a way that obviously allows our customers to have more choice and more opportunities.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. Thanks, Jim. Thanks for that comprehensive answer.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker on line. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning and warm welcome back to Oscar. First question probably for Gerry and Oscar, that incremental 2.5% of potential labor-related CASM, was that for \u2013 I apologize, for all working groups or just the two TAs that are out for ratification right now, one of which comes back tomorrow?","Gerry Laderman","No, Jamie, that was just for the two that are out for ratification.","Jamie Baker","Okay. And for Oscar, you have talked with us about winning back the frontline. Do these increases in wages accomplish this in your mind or are there still incremental expenses that are required that might not be captured in the labor line, whether that\u2019s I don\u2019t know better tools for employee, new uniforms, that sort of thing that could pressure CASM a little bit further?","Oscar Munoz","You know what, Jamie, it\u2019s probably a little early for me to actually quantify what the impacts of these are, but my commitment is to balance both our commitment to our employees and make the appropriate investments and prioritize investments while understanding that we have broader stockholder base. And so it\u2019s a delicate balance between those two. And again, the more time I spend out in the field understanding the needs, the needs aren\u2019t as great as you think expense wise. So certainly, comp is one. But beyond that, I think building the right systems tools, uniforms, things like coffee and peanuts and all add up, but they are just at appropriate level investments that will strike a balance with. But again, I can\u2019t quantify anything at this point in time.","Greg Hart","Jamie, let me just add that, that process has started. It started last year. And the CASM guidance you see for this year includes some of that already, some of the tools and some of the other investments, we are making that\u2019s rolling into the CASM guidance that you see. And let me just, by the way, I need to clarify to Dan on the NOL, as of 12\/31\/15, the remaining NOL is a little closer to $8 billion and $9 billion. Sorry to interrupt you.","Jamie Baker","Yes, no, no, that\u2019s fine. Actually for follow-up, while I have you, Gerry, the 73-700 is a larger gauge than I have been at least I thought you were looking at in terms of potential bridging that gap between 76 CRJs and I guess, the A319s. So, what shifted in terms of the decision-making process? Does this entirely eliminate the need for something smaller than the 319 at the mainline? How did the price of fuel impact the calculus? Any additional color there?","Gerry Laderman","Sure. I would say, the price of fuel really doesn\u2019t impact our decisions on long-term fleet orders, but I would say that for this batch of aircraft, where we looked at all the variations, in fact, the 319 as well as the 737 and the 100-seat opportunities from both Embraer and Bombardier for this batch of aircraft, the 700 was the winner. As I mentioned, we will continue to look at aircraft and we will continue to look at each of those aircraft types going forward.","Jamie Baker","Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks very much, gentlemen.","Operator","Credit Suisse, we have Julie Yates on line. Please go ahead.","Julie Yates","Good morning and welcome back, Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you.","Julie Yates","Gerry, a follow-up on the buyback, how should we think about just the seasonality of cash flow generation and then the timing of other cash requirements like debt payments and pension fund and just as the year progresses?","Gerry Laderman","So, it depends on the type. So, for pension funding, we have a fair amount of flexibility. So, I would assume right now relatively even through at least the first three quarters. On aircraft CapEx, we have some in the first quarter. There is a bit of a lag and then some in the back half of the year. And everything else is fairly flat through the year.","Julie Yates","Okay. And then Jim, one for you, you noted competitive capacity actions at about 1.5 point headwind again in the first quarter. You noticed any changes in competitive pricing actions either domestically or internationally? And do you worry that those worsen in a lower fuel environment?","Jim Compton","Julie, I don\u2019t want to comment on competitive pricing. It\u2019s obviously it\u2019s a \u2013 this business is very competitive and we obviously match capacity in our demand given the pricing structures that are out there, but I don\u2019t want to make any comments on competitive pricing actions. We will, as I mentioned in the script, that given where competitive pricing actions are today that the hypothetical the assumption that\u2019s where we are today. We begin to lap some of that effect by the time we hit the third quarter.","Julie Yates","Okay, understood. And then just on the phases of cabin segmentation, that was certainly helpful. At some point, do you anticipate being able to put some quantification around what that can add in terms of revenues?","Gerry Laderman","Yes, we look forward to doing that. That segmentation that we talked about we have been working hard on it in 2015 and so we are excited about rolling it out going forward. What that will do for us is a couple of things. One it will allow us to compete with ultra-low cost carriers much more effectively, which means more pure product for customers that are looking for just that price point. And it will also, as I mentioned, help us remove some of the dilution that we have in our pricing structure today. And so I am not ready yet to kind of quantify, but as we rollout the second half of the year, I look forward to updating you on that.","Julie Yates","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth on line. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions for me. We get a lot of questions from investors about closing the gap from a margin perspective to the industry. It looks like based on the 1Q guidance and certainly 1Q is not the year and you have got some hedge impact there, but it looks like that gap actually widens in the March quarter. So, is closing that gap still a goal for the company? What should we be advising investors in that regard and if so, over what timeframe?","Gerry Laderman","Hey, Duane, I will start. It\u2019s Gerry. So it is still a goal. We have never put a timeframe on it, but we are very focused on doing what we can do both on the costs side and the revenue side to continue to maximize our margin, but we haven\u2019t at this point, put a timeframe on it.","Greg Hart","So I think form the network side, we are very focused on growing efficiently. And so we talked about up-gauging a lot over the past year and 2015 was the first phase of that where we are seeing growth with the use of slim line. And as Gerry mentioned contributed to the CASM side, comes at a lower RASM, it had significant contribution to the CASM side. We will continue to do that as we also look at frequency reduction and up-gauging into the mainline aircraft from the regional aircraft. And we can do that seat neutral in certain markets. As we have up-gauge that and we drive lower departures actually it\u2019s really efficient growth and it comes with efficient fuel costs. And so it all kind of works together and we are very much focused on driving that this year.","Oscar Munoz","Duane, if I could just maybe slightly more definitive on the issue of industry comparisons and all of that, it\u2019s a competitive industry and I am a competitive guy. And so lest anything else we said, we will always have our eyesight on folks that are maybe at this point in time and sort of performing a little better than us. I will tell you what the most critical question around that is, do you have the potential, do you have the capacity, do you have the ability with your network, with your people with all of that. And one of the things I have seen in the relatively short time I have been here is a tremendous amount of all of those things starting with the energy, excitement of our front-line employees, frankly it\u2019s where it really starts. So at the end of the day, over the long-term, we certainly believe our relative earnings profile will improve and when and how and all that, that\u2019s more than I am trying to get done here over the next few months.","Gerry Laderman","And Duane, it\u2019s right on up-gauging remember that 2016 is a year where there is a dip in that process from 2015. It\u2019s just the cadence of new aircraft orders. That ramps up again in 2017 and continues nicely through 2019.","Duane Pfennigwerth","I appreciate that comment. And Oscar, personally we are all amazed that you are on this call and wish you a continued strong recovery. Just on the network side, I had one question. Please check us on this. But we went back and looked at utilization changes, aircraft hours per day over the course of 2015 and many had a nice year-to-year improvement in that and frankly that was what was driving capacity growth. In the case of United, it looks like utilization was actually modestly down. We assume this is an effort to improve reliability, maybe more spares, can you just talk about it, this is the case and the reasons behind it and if there is any cost opportunity there longer term? Thanks for taking the questions.","Jim Compton","Yes. The \u2013 one of the things we are driving is our seats per aircraft are going up, so we are driving growth that way. But clearly, as we reinvested in reliability, we want to make sure that the network is driving the right results from the reliability stage. In addition, part of our strategy of growing seats is to lower our stage length, I mean so some of that utilization to drive it an improved network is from a lower stage lengths which is driving block down. So it\u2019s a combination of couple of things, both investment in reliability as well as our network strategy going forward to set us up to grow efficiently.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Flightglobal, we have Edward Russell on line. Please go ahead.","Edward Russell","Hi, I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on where you are cutting capacity out of Houston and where you plan to grow in San Francisco and Denver for the network side?","Jim Compton","Hi Edward, this is Jim. I think if you think about what we were looking at for Houston in 2016, we are going to grow Houston approximately slightly up about 2%. I think given what we are seeing in the market and as my comments on energy and what\u2019s happening in the Houston hub, we will probably keep that relatively flat for the year. And so that capacity, as we look at places of strength, San Fran and Denver to the East Coast, what we are focused on, to fill in some holes that we don\u2019t serve today, that will be clearly focused on business markets. And you will see the strong commitment in Houston just adjusted slightly to use that capacity in markets that are performing better right now.","Edward Russell","Okay. And that\u2019s you are keeping growth in Houston at 2% this year, that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s correct?","Jim Compton","I am sorry, could you say that again?","Edward Russell","You said you are keeping growth in Houston at about \u2013 capacity growth at about 2% in 2016?","Jim Compton","No, our plan was to grow at about 2%. I think you will see it relatively flat in 2016 given the market.","Edward Russell","Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. Jonathan I will turn it back to you for closing remarks.","Jonathan Ireland","Okay. As we are out of time, we will conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call Media Relations or Investor Relations if you have any further questions. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Leskinen","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in yesterday's release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. Number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, investor update and presentation, copies of which are available on our website.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. In addition, we have other members of the team in the room available to assist with Q&A.","And now, I'd like to turn over the call to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Mike, and thank you all of us for joining us today.","Well, what a difference a year makes. No doubt, remember, that over a year ago when we laid out our multi-year growth strategy and set forth a series of concrete promises, I'm proud to say that in 2018 our incredible United team, over 90,000 strong, got to work for fulfilling those promises because what matters is proof, not promise.","You'll remember that we said we would deliver higher unit revenue in 2018, while simultaneously increasing supply, we have. And many on Wall Street believed this was possible, when we initially announced our plan and now there are a few questions of our continued growth. As we've talked about this uniquely United growth strategy is that not all capacity is created equal and I think we proved that this year.","In fact, our PRASM has or is expected to outpace the industry in each of the last four quarters, and is likely to outpace the industry by approximately 200 basis points in 2018.","We turn to Slide 5. You'll also remember that we said we are expected to increase our 2018 adjusted EPS between $6.50 and $8.50 and we have and we'll get better, i.e., $9.13 per share for the year. We also said we would be laser focused on cost discipline, with a full year CASMex goal flat to down 1%.","We have again delivered on that promise, expecting to lead the industry with a CASMex down 0.2% for the year. We also said that we'd ensure that our commitment toward smart growth strategy wouldn't detract from our focus on running a great operations and we have.","In fact, we flew more passengers than ever last year, and achieved the highest completion rate in our history. So, no doubt there is much more work to be done and we are very proud of the significant progress we made in 2018. And I thank all our employees.","Now the question, of course, becomes what difference will the next year make? So as we look ahead to 2019, we are paying very close attention to the government shutdown, potential trade disruptions, other sources of economic instability. We read the same headlines that you do and while concerning, we've not, to this point, detected much of an impact on our numbers.","Scott will walk through our facts that we are making this particular point. Of course, we will keep watching and in the meantime, we will just stay focused on the priorities that we can control, in particular, the way we serve our customers.","So, switching to that, more than ever, we're focused on putting our customers, all of them at the center of everything that we do. This year we'll continue to roll out a series of innovations and improvements to customer experience and we believe we will continue to reshape United's image. We will introduce a series of new routes, boosted by new customer-friendly aircraft that are designed to make United the airline our customers choose to fly.","Just next week, we will be able to download a completely reimagined version of the United app. It's already the number one downloaded app amongst US carriers but we are making it even better, putting useful information at your fingertips without losing the features our customers love.","We'll also continue to add useful information to over 60,000 mobile devices used by your employees that have real-time information and communicate better and solve your problems in the moment. These are just a few of the examples of the digital advantage that has resulted from the new entrepreneurial culture that we're fostering here at United.","This culture, coupled with our deep company-wide commitment to our core four principles, will be essential to the success of our efforts to take our standard of customer service to a whole new level.","Lastly, moving to Slide 6. Let me emphasize that while we're delivering on our commitments to our customers, we are also delivering on our commitments to you and our shareholders. Last year, our ability to recover almost 100% of the year-over-year increase in fuel expense helped us achieve a full year adjusted EPS of $9.13. In 2019, we are committed to delivering an adjusted EPS target of $10 to $12, which puts us nicely ahead of the pace to deliver our adjusted EPS of $11 to $13 in 2020.","So with that, let me hand it over to Scott.","Scott Kirby","Thanks Oscar, and thanks, everyone for joining us on the call today.","2018 was a fantastic year financially, operationally and for our customers. We operated the most on-time flights in United's history. This is the result of the commitment and hard work of the entire United team that came together to deliver a great operation and experience for our customers. From the frontline to the corporate support center, everyone played a part and I'd like to thank all of them.","In 2018, we continued to run a great operation, including top-tier [D-0] performance, all while flying a record number of passengers and with record load factors. We had the best ever consolidating completion factor in our history and drove a record 9.3% revenue growth year-over-year. As Andrew will talk about later, we believe our strong operation and continuously improving customer focus drove about a point of PRASM improvement in the quarter.","These operational steps, coupled with our strong PRASM performance and our return to margin growth in the fourth quarter are clear evidence that the growth plan we announced this time last January is the right strategy for United. As we look at 2019, we all know that there is a relationship between costs, with fuel being the industry's most volatile cost and revenue. It's precisely what gives us the confidence to give annual and multi-year adjusted EPS guidance.","This historical relationship is why we were confident giving full year guidance for the first time last year. And we're able to maintain and raise that guidance even as fuel rose significantly during the year.","This historical relationship not only gives us confidence for one-year guidance, but also allowed us to provide $11 to $13 adjusted EPS guidance for 2020 because we were confident that PRASM would increase in the world of higher fuel. Set another way, unpredictable fuel costs are reality, but at United, they will not be an excuse to miss our guidance.","Our revenue strategy, combined with our cost discipline gives us confidence that we can continue - that we can continue to meet or exceed our adjusted 2019 EPS targets anywhere between $40 and $80 Brent Oil.","As Oscar mentioned, there's been a lot of concern on Wall Street about the health of the economy as we enter 2019. We normally don't react to a single week's worth of bookings because of the inherent volatility in bookings. But the first full week back from the holidays is unique, as business customers are back in the office and planning business trips.","It's the largest booking week of the year and the first opportunity to see what's happened with corporate budgets. Historically, the companies we are seeing weakness are concerned about the outlook. They almost always reduce the travel and entertainment budget for the coming year. As a result, business bookings for the first week of the year are reasonably good forward indicator for the health of economy.","And despite all the stock market volatility hindering, despite the government shutdown, our business bookings is measured by all large corporate accounts and travel agencies, we're up 11% at slightly higher yield last week. The world can certainly change going forward. But United Airlines demand remains solid, at least, based on the data we have so far.","Over the last several earnings call, you've heard us talk a lot about the benefits of our growth strategy. But today, I want to talk to you about another change that's hard to quantify and even harder to proceed from the outside of the company, but it's essential to driving strong PRASM and margin growth. In short, at United, we're changing our culture. We started to shift to a nimbler, faster and more action-oriented approach to improving our customer and employee experience.","I can't tell you the number of times I sit in a meeting or someone walks into my office to show me something new and innovative that we're doing. You're able to see it in the performance of Gemini, to develop an industry-leading mobile app and the powerful new technology that we put in the hands of our employees.","Our teams are developing new ideas literally every day and testing them in speeds we wouldn't have thought possible. We are now experimenting with all kinds of new initiatives and solutions, quickly expanding those that work and pulling back those that don't. And this is happening throughout United.","At the start of last year's budget process, as an example, we asked the teams to keep M&A total headcount flat, despite growing 5% and adding all kinds of initiatives to deploy. There's a fair bit of anxiety around this from the team, but we did it and achieved the great results that we announced today.","For this year's budget process, we took it a step further and set a goal to keep total M&A spending flat. So, leaders had to fund growth, new initiatives and pay raises without spending a single dollar more. And I'm proud to say that the team had embraced that challenge with the positive 'can do' spirit. It isn't an easy target to hit, but aided by our new entrepreneurial culture that\u2019s taking root, we are confident we will do it.","We're committed to making United best airline in the world. We have the world's best network potential and this ongoing culture change really is a significant and difficult to replicate competitive advantage for United. We had a great year in 2018, and I again want to thank the team for delivery.","There's a lot happening at United. The growth plan, focused on the customer, great operations, and a new action-oriented culture facilitated by core4, to name just a few. As a result, we're confident that we'll meet or exceed our $10 to $12 EPS guidance in 2019 for any fuel price between $40 and $80 per barrel.","As we said before, unpredictable fuel prices will not be an excuse here at United. 2018 was an incredible year, and set a solid foundation for the strategy we laid out one year ago. We're looking forward to repeating our success in 2019.","With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.","Andrew Nocella","Thanks Scott.","Turning to Slide 12. I'm pleased to report our revenue momentum continued from the third quarter and into fourth, with PRASM growth up 5%, achieving the high end of our expectations. All entities achieved positive PRASM in the quarter.","For all of 2018, we achieved 4.3% increase in the PRASM on 4.9% more capacity. We achieved the high end of our unit revenue guide each quarter in 2018. Congratulations to the entire United team for top-tier PRASM performance in the quarter.","There were a number uniquely United initiatives that drove our PRASM outperformance in 2018, outside of just our capacity growth. Our employees delivered a record setting operational performance and improved our customer service, which we estimate will add about a point of revenue to our PRASM year-over-year.","Gemini, our proprietary revenue management system, which was also rolled out last year, has exceeded our expectations. We leapfrogged our competitors and have an industry leading RF tool that delivered 1 point of PRASM growth in 2018.","Lastly, we further sharpened our product segmentation strategy to better deliver our customers the product they want, when they want it. These improvements and our host of other commercial and digital initiatives contributed about an additional point to PRASM. The culture change Scott talked about and delivered in an environment where innovation and change are welcome. Overall, we feel good that the plan we laid out in January 2018 is working as we head into 2019.","Now for some details about each of the regions on Slide 13. Domestic PRASM improved 6% year-over-year in the quarter, leading away across all regions. Domestic capacity increased 6.4% in the quarter and 6.7% for 2018. Corporate revenues were once again strong year-over-year, outpacing our overall top line growth of 11%.","We continue to successfully shift our booking profile to reduce dependence on lower-yielding tickets booked further out from departure, while increasing our share of higher yielding business tickets generally booked closer in.","Gemini worked well last year and implementing this strategy. Our RM posture as we enter 2019 continues and accelerates this practice, relative to the industry. Following two years of very strong Atlantic PRASM growth, we saw Q4 PRASM growth of more moderate 1.6%. Passenger load factor was strong, increasing 5.2 points year-over-year. However, that increase was not large enough to offset declining close yields.","Our outlook continues to show coach yield weakness, and as a result, slower PRASM growth with the Atlantic in the coming months. PRASM across the Pacific was up 4.5% year over year in Q4, our third quarter positive for PRASM.","We continue to watch demand levels in business class for China play and have yet to see any reduction in demand for January, resulting from these trade disputes. After negative PRASM growth in Q2 and Q3 of 2018, Latin performance inflected sharply positive, increasing 3.8% in the fourth quarter. We are optimistic about strong PRASM from the Latin region, even with continued weakness in Brazil and Argentina.","Looking ahead, we anticipate first quarter consolidated system PRASM to be flat to up 3% year-over-year. The shift of Easter holiday to mid-April is expected to be an 80 basis point headwind for Q1, with an equal tailwind for Q2. As we look at the revenue environment, the primary change we observed is pricing across the Atlantic.","While it has gotten weaker, we believe it will improve as we enter peak travel in Q2. Overall, we do not think anything fundamental has changed as we look at the demand environment. That being said, the government shutdown and other factors have created some uncertainty in our Q1 outlook, and as such, we've guided to a 3 point range in yield revenue this quarter.","As Scott mentioned earlier, domestic business bookings for the week of January 7th, the first clean booking week of the year were strong, indicating to us that our momentum continues to be on track. Our capacity outlook for 2019 remains at 4% to 6%.","Our passenger segmentation strategies remain on track. Induction of widebody jets equipped with our all-aisle access flatbed Polaris seats continue to be on target. The mid-continent strategy continues with our Denver rebank scheduled for February.","We're pleased with the results we've seen in both Houston and Chicago and see even more upside in Denver, and the possible itineraries at all three have grown about 12% year-over-year. The basic economy footprint has continued to grow. We continue to closely monitor our relative share performance related to basic economy sales. We feel it is important to differentiate our basic product and we continue to be pleased with the operational benefits of our bag policy.","Another key component to our passenger segmentation strategy is Premium Plus, our new intercontinental premium economy seats. Early sales figures for Premium Plus have average fares of approximately two times the coach fare, above what we had planned for. ","Our ancillary revenue had a fantastic year as well, with revenues up 13% for the year. Increase in fees paid to upgrade into first class was a key area of success. In late 2018, we also started the sale of a limited number of preferred seats that will be a new revenue stream in 2019. As always, most passengers have the option of either picking a non-preferred seat for free or waiting to select an eligibility seat for free at the time of check-in.","In summary, we're all set up for a strong first quarter and we'll continue to focus on enhancing the customer experience.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Gerry.","Gerry Laderman","Thanks Andrew. Good morning, everyone.","Yesterday afternoon we released our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings and our first quarter and full-year 2019 Investor Update. You can refer to those documents for additional details.","For the highlights, Slide 17 is a summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 18 shows our non-GAAP adjusted results. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.41. That's 67% higher than a year ago and above the high end of our own expectations.","Adjusted pre-tax income was $814 million and adjusted pre-tax margin was 7.8%, up nearly 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $9.13, which is 33% higher than 2017. This is a fantastic result and above the high end of our guidance.","Adjusted pre-tax income was $3.2 billion and adjusted pre-tax margin was 7.7%. We are all proud of these results, and we believe they provide powerful evidence that our growth strategy is working.","Slide 19 shows our total unit cost for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018 and our forecast for the first quarter and full-year 2019.","Turning to Slide 20. Non-fuel unit costs in the fourth quarter decreased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis, better than the midpoint of our expectations going into the quarter. We continued to benefit from improved asset utilization, smarter maintenance practices, and lower aircraft ownership costs. For both the first quarter and full year 2019, we plan to, again, manage our non-fuel unit costs to flat or better and expect our cost discipline this year to remain industry leading.","We believe that running an efficient airline is a prerequisite to growth, and we expect to continue to benefit from a lot of the same initiatives we had in 2018 and to take advantages of new opportunities.","For example, as we begin to exit certain aircraft types, such as our oldest Airbus A320s and Boeing 757, we will benefit from optimizing the retirement schedule and related maintenance costs for these aircraft.","It's also worth noting that we continue to benefit on the cost side from running a more reliable operation. Greater reliability allows for more efficient planning, allowing for less over time, as well as improved irregular operation recovery and generally, fewer buffers across the system.","As you see on Slide 21, we repurchased $240 million in shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $88. Over the full year, we repurchased about $1.25 billion of our shares at an average price of $71 per share. I expect we will continue to be opportunistic with our share repurchases as our shares trade below our view of intrinsic value.","During the month of December, we ordered four additional Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, with two of these aircraft delivering this year and two delivering next year. These aircraft are highly efficient for routes that have demand for large premium cabins. Also during the month of December, we finalized an order for 24 additional Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, with deliveries beginning next year.","These aircraft will allow us to replace older and smaller gauge aircraft domestically and support our capacity plan. The unit cost advantage of these more fuel efficient and larger aircraft is expected to be in the double digits and support our CASMex initiatives for years to come.","Our adjusted CapEx spend for 2018 ended at $4.2 billion, above our earlier expectations. This difference is largely due to opportunistic purchases of used aircraft and aircraft off-lease, which were not originally in our plan. We continually work to maximize both return on invested capital and our aircraft ownership costs as we update and upgauge our fleet. Even with this incremental spend, however, we had strong free cash flow of approximately $2 billion for the year.","For 2019, taking into account, the additional firm aircraft order I mentioned, along with existing aircraft orders, continued opportunistic purchases of used aircraft and other high-value investments, we currently anticipate spending approximately $4.7 billion in adjusted CapEx for 2019.","Finally, Slide 22 includes a summary of our current guidance, including the projected fuel price range for the first quarter. The range provided for capacity, revenue and cost implies a first quarter expectation of adjusted pre-tax margin between 2.5% and 4.5%. Implying at the midpoint of this range, 150 basis points of margin improvement on an adjusted - on an adjusted basis year-over-year.","Also on Slide 22, we provide a summary of our full-year 2019 guidance. We are confident that we will deliver our adjusted EPS guidance of $10 to $12 this year. As you all know, fuel has been extremely volatile over the last few months and we're frankly not in the business of forecasting where jet fuel prices settle.","What we are confident about is our ability to nimbly manage our airline to deliver bottom line results in a wide range of macro environment. In that spirit, we run numerous scenarios for fuel from as low as $40 per barrel to as high as $80 per barrel. We're committing today to meet or exceed our guidance of $10 to $12, and adjusted EPS this year within that very wide range of fuel prices.","Before we take questions, last Wednesday, we released our December and full-year 2018 traffic results. Moving forward, we will no longer be issuing these monthly traffic results. As we focus on our long-term earnings targets, we believe monthly updates are unnecessary distractions from the steady progress we expect to deliver.","With that, I will turn it over to Mike to begin the Q&A.","Michael Leskinen","Thank you, Gerry.","First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And from J.P. Morgan, we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","I'd like to start with a quick cost question for Gerry. The 4% pilot raise that's effective this month or has already gone into effect this month? I obviously have estimates. But can you share with us in dollars what that drives in terms of incremental 2019 expense? I just want to better understand the underlying W2 component of pilot comp as we look forward to next year and I don't necessarily trust Form 41 on this?","Gerry Laderman","Jamie, that's a detail we can just follow up with you later.","Jamie Baker","Second, when I think about last year's RASM, and what that potentially portends coming into this year, I think most of the focus understandably was on the mid-continent growth, the speed with which RASM ramped quickly in those markets. But the reality is, you've also called a considerable number of what, presumably were underperforming unprofitable markets across the network.","Is there any way to quantify, which has had more of a positive impact than the other? I mean, adding the new stuff or cutting the weak stuff. The reason I ask is that, I've got to imagine most of the underperformers have already been cut, which suggests that RASM going forward is going to be much more indicative of how the network actually handles the growth component, if that makes sense. Any color?","Andrew Nocella","I'm not sure I agree. I think while we did get rid of a few routes, I think approximately 30 that were underperforming financially, I think there's more to come. And Jamie, what I would say is the potential of our - or the way we look at it is our pipeline of ideas and changes was not just for 2018, there's a lot of - the initiative for 2018 that apply for 2019 and then there's a whole list of other initiatives that come online.","And I'll just - I have a few examples I suppose. The Gemini RM system, which we turned on early last year, we really didn't get fully sold until 2Q. So, we think there is tailwinds from that, that will continue to come.","In 2019, we have another 60 wide-body jets that will get Polaris all-access aisle seats. We're going to rebank the Denver hub on February 14th, that's not in our baseline numbers. And the number of departures for bank go from 43 to 50.","The other, tidbit example, we've cut the number of pre 6 am flights by 50%. For 2019, our 6 am flights have RASMs that are 9% greater than our 5 am flights. Last fall I talked about the transfer of aircraft from New York to Dallas, that transfer, we're doing Phase 2 of it as we speak right now.","We've moved about 33 aircraft flying around and amazingly enough, the margin point change for that is 50 points for those 33 aircraft and almost all of that will be in 2019. We have this full capacity we added in 2018, in the '19, for example, our Singapore and Sydney new flights. That's about 1% of our company, and we expect those two new flights to perform much better this year than they did last year.","We'll obviously continue to add our catchment area of growth line from mid-continent hubs. That's worked well. But even better than that, the number of flights that are in bank in 2019 versus 2018 that all of these hubs is going from 89% to 95%, in-bank flights have better RASM. We are growing our premium cabins from New York to LA and San Francisco. It's really important for us.","We're going to continue to grow our co-brand card. We're going to continue to fill up Premium Plus. The point is, there is a whole host of RASM initiatives as we go into 2019 that we think are going to fuel United Airlines. They're not all about growth. In fact, many of them are not at all about growth as we go forward.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","I think this is probably too for Scott. Hey, Scott. How will these strong run of financial results and the business momentum you guys have been showing impacted the tone or the pace of the negotiations with the pilots, particularly on some of these more complicated issues?","Scott Kirby","So first, I'm actually afraid to answer a question after everything that Andrew said. I, kind, of want to stop the call after that. Hard to go up from there. But look, good results create a good background for everyone on getting - whether it's getting contracts done, doing deals with other partners. It certainly doesn't hurt the tone of the tables. We are having good run - I'm talking about the details there. We're having good discussions with ICAO.","We have good relations with all of our unions. We're looking forward to getting competitive deals done that are good for our people and good for the company. And we're confident that we're going to get there. But good results help the tone of everything.","Hunter Keay","And then also, Scott, what did you learn in the last five years about how the market values airline stocks and also how investors value airline capital deployment?","Scott Kirby","Boy, that's going to be a tough question.","Hunter Keay","You can handle.","Scott Kirby","First, I think, whether I have learned it or not, I think at the end of the day results are what are going to matter and results are what matter the most. We are trying to focus here, as Oscar often says, on proof not promise, it's a dramatic difference as we sit here today and when we said almost exactly a year ago, when we announced the growth plan and the difference is that we're proving that what we're doing works.","We spent time today trying to talk about things beyond growth. Andrew had three points of PRASM, that we think three points of PRASM in the quarter about things that had nothing to do with growth. There's just an awful lot going on here at United that we feel really confident, that we're going to be able to continue to drive earnings and margin growth for years to come. And ultimately that will matter.","I do think from an investor perspective, credibility is important. And when I say credibility, I mean, credibility on delivering on your numbers. We talked about last year a \"no excuses, sir\" mentality and the importance of hitting guidance.","Today, we've tried to even expand on that by saying we're giving you guidance that is good for any fuel price raise between $40 and $80 a barrel on Brent Oil. We know that there are going to be speed bumps that are going to happen. The government shutdown was one of those things.","And as we look long term, there is going to be a quarter, there's going to be a time when those speed bumps become significant enough that despite our best efforts, we can't overcome them in any given quarter or year. We hope that's not this quarter. We hope that's not this year. But we're also giving you guidance that allows us to hit some speed bumps.","We have resiliency, flexibility to adjust and even if we hit speed bumps, we are committed to, as we said before moving heaven and earth to hit our numbers. And I don't know what that means for industry multiple. But as long as we keep growing earnings every year, as long as we keep delivering on our commitments, I believe that not only will we get a higher stock price from higher earnings, but we will get a higher multiple as that credibility grows and people have more confidence.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","I guess, my first question is around the growth rate. You reiterated your 4% to 6% growth plan in '19. 4Q is at the high end of this. 1Q is going to be towards the higher end. I guess, just in this kind of backdrop of slightly slowing global economic growth, why is the high end the prudent way to start off the year?","Andrew Nocella","We end 2018 on a high note and we look at how things are doing right now and we think we're still on a high note. There are definitely risk factors out there and we've widened our range for RASM, But we feel really good about our plan.","And then as Scott already said, this is a lot more than growth that is driving the RASM of the company. And so all those other initiatives are just as important and unique, I think, to United at this point. And so we're excited to go in that direction and believe we can deliver on the results we\u2019ve talked about and promise for the year.","Andrew Didora","I guess, just looking at that growth a little bit more closely, just based on the schedules, it still seems like a big part of your domestic strategy, as you head through '19 is still much more focused around the regional flying. So, maybe can you give us a sense of where you think, what inning are you in terms of your mid-continent doled out and how long can this kind of regional growth do you think continue to outperform mainline?","Andrew Nocella","I think it's done, obviously, very well and we have more runway there. We're going to take it quarter-by-quarter, and we're going to adjust as needed. To be said, things don't look the way they like. We like them. But at this point, they do. We are still relatively undersized in our level of connectivity we offer.","And so we are working hard at that and improving the quality of the schedules, and you'll see more of that. But I just think we're very bullish on where we've been and where we're going, and we'll be nimble if we have to change.","Andrew Didora","And then just quickly, one last question. You mentioned the Denver rebanking beginning kind of mid next month. How would you rank that rebanking opportunity relative to what you've done in Houston and Chicago? Thanks.","Andrew Nocella","Sure. It's similar, maybe worth a little bit more. We're taking the number of banks down by one, which is increasing our connectivity. We will have 43 aircraft - or 50 aircraft on the ground at the same time on average versus 43. So, we're pretty optimistic about it. But that being said, there are other changes we are making to the schedule in Chicago and Houston as well.","We better tweak those and make them better, the early flights of the day and the more rebank places are a good example for that. So, we are going to continue to mine this mid-continent hub strategy. And we think we have a long way to go.","And again, not all of those things are entirely about growth, changing when our place departs or making the bank sizes difference is not necessarily about growth. So, there's a lot of different dimensions what we are working on.","Operator","From Citigroup, we have Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey","Maybe it's for you as well, Andrew. When we look at the 2018 performance, which was very strong from a revenue perspective, when I understand the effect that regional variances and easy comparisons had versus strategy and also like what - whether you see 2019 having more of the dollar benefit from the initiatives you put in place than 2018. Basically, I'm trying to see how we should see comps and regional variances versus your strategy over '18 and '19.","Andrew Nocella","I think we fought really well in 2018 and I'm not going to attribute it to easy comps. I, in particular, for the fourth quarter, I'm not going to attribute it to easy comps. I think we had a reasonable setup and we hit it out of the park in fourth quarter and we are really happy about it.","As we go forward to the next year, we have a whole host of initiatives. We are not going to break them out and say, what each one is worth. And by the way, there is plenty of initiatives that we didn't talk about and there is plenty of initiatives that increase margin but do lower RASM. It's just the nature of the piece.","And so we feel really bullish as we go into this year that there is this little bit more of uncertainty, which is why we widened the range of the RASM guide. But we believe our initiatives are going to still deliver and lead to the EPS targets that Mike and the team have laid out.","Kevin Crissey","Maybe if I could look at this maybe a little differently. What aspect of your network strategy was most beneficial in 2018? If I had to say, you could only pick one thing you have done that you did in 2018, which one would you do again?","Andrew Nocella","You are asking a network guy a question and it's hard to answer because we did so many great things. But I think in more aircraft on the ground, at the same time, it's just fundamental and that is connectivity. So that is awfully importantly and we look forward to do it more that in 2019.","The other example I'll give is, we grew capacity a lot on off-peak days. And we did that because in years passed, United had, in theory, cut capacity on those days to reduce RASM, when in fact our results for this year showed that our RASM under off-peak days actually went up more than our average RASM. And that's because United uniquely cuts muscle from the bone, is the best way to say it. And that actually lowered RASM. It didn't increased RASM.","So, one of my favorite things in 2018 is taking off-peak days, growing them faster than average and increasing RASM faster than the company's average throughout the year. I don't know if we can do that again in 2019. All we did was returns those off-peak days to these normal schedules that we should have always had as many of our competitors have as normal. But that was an exciting achievement for the year.","Kevin Crissey","And maybe one little quick question for Gerry. Gerry, the slide on the flatter, better costs in Q1 and assuming for the year, is that drawn to scale? Is that supposed to indicate a similar numbers or is that just a directionality downer?","Michael Leskinen","Kevin, this is Mike. It's not the scale. Do not get your ruler out.","Operator","And from Credit Suisse, we have Joe Caiado. Please go ahead.","Jose Caiado","First question for Andrew and Gerry. Just following up on Andrew's earlier question on Denver and your expectations from the rebank. I think you'd previously said, you expected that to start driving improved results in Denver starting in late February. I'm just wondering if that expectation is embedded in your Q1 PRASM guidance.","Andrew Nocella","Yes. Yes and yes. February, 14th and yes.","Jose Caiado","And then that expectation is again based off of your lessons learned in Chicago and Houston but maybe a little bit better it sounds like? Or you not assuming that potential for it to be a little bit better?","Andrew Nocella","Well, I mean, each hub had a baseline that we're trying to improve from and Denver is a great hub, before we made this change to be very clear. So, each number for each hub is different based on exactly what we were doing. Denver has one fewer bank. It's a dramatic increase in our connectivity. Particularly during the middle of the day, it's a dramatic decrease in the number of pre 6:00 am flights and it's increase in the number of early am departures out of Denver for our local passengers.","So, we're not going to give a specific number for Denver. But as we create the revenue plan for the year and the revenue guidance for Q1, we do make an attempt to make sure that what we are working on is reflected in that guidance.","Jose Caiado","And then just one more for Gerry. Just given the new lease accounting standards and moving pieces on the balance sheet, do you have an updated view of what you think the right leverage range is for the company going forward?","Gerry Laderman","As I said before, I think we're in that range. We spend a lot of work over the last six, seven, years, getting our balance sheet into the position it's in today, where we have a very manageable debt load including our capitalized leases. We have $7 billion of unencumbered assets. We have very manageable amortization schedule. Everything about our balance sheet is in great shape.","I wouldn't anticipate it moving much one way or another. We'll continue to finance new aircraft deliveries. I would expect most of those to be dead. I would say that the lease market is getting a little more attractive than it's been historically. So, there could be a mix there. But as new debt comes on, we've got the debt amortizing. So, it's going to stay in the range it is and we're very comfortable with the state of our balance sheet.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Have you guys put out an estimate for the impact of the shutdown, just given your presence in the DC market?","Scott Kirby","No, we haven't. We do have a largest exposure. We have a biggest presence in DC. But as we said, it's hard for us to know what the impact is right now or what it's going to be. We also don't know how long it's going to go. And really what we did is gave a wider range to reflect that uncertainty. Maybe after the quarter when it's all over, we'll try to look back and see what the impact was. But right now we're not going try to pin a number on it.","Michael Linenberg","And then just a question to Gerry. Just in the income statement, there was a sizable decline in depreciation and amortization - excuse me, aircraft rents, you got cut a bit. And I just wasn't sure if that was actually tied to the move toward lease accounting and I don't even - my sense is that just looking at the balance sheet that you have yet to make the adjustment, is that a 2019 phenomenon? So, sort of a two-part question there on lease accounting.","Gerry Laderman","So the reduction in rent expense is largely due to the initiative we have of buying aircraft off-lease. Switching from rent expense to basically depreciation, in many cases, is terrific and is factored into our CASM numbers.","Particularly for mid-life aircraft, the lease expense - going from lease expense appreciation reduces ownership costs by 60% to 80% in some cases. So, that's why there is that significant drop in rent expense. And then lease accounting is - you'll start seeing that next year.","Operator","And from Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","So listen, I don't mean to be too much of a nerdy analyst here, but if I take the midpoint of your full-year guidance and I look at the current fuel curve, I think that implies something like a flat RASM outcome for the year. So, I just wanted to ask, is that something in the plans? Are you guys looking to get momentum on unit revenues throughout the year?","Scott Kirby","Brandon, we'd encourage you not to be a nerdy analyst. Because really what we're trying to say is we can hit, and we said, meet or exceed our $10 to $12 guidance range at any fuel price between $40 and $80. That's another way of saying.","At some fuel prices, we think we will end up above that range. But you shouldn't try to pin down a fuel number today and say that's what we think RASM is today because we've intentionally tried to move to a rule where we were going to tell you an EPS number and we're going to have a commitment to you that we try to hit that we do everything we can to hit that EPS number in a wide range of fuel prices. And we're getting away from point guidance on fuel changes constantly or on RASM.","Brandon Oglenski","And I think I get the sense too that there's a higher focus on margin? Or is that also correct or incorrect?","Scott Kirby","That is correct.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. And the last one\u2026","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we have Catherine O'Brien. Please go ahead.","Catherine O'Brien","So, maybe one more question is on the complexion of your capacity growth for this year. Based on schedule so far, it looks like you have a couple of long haul routes that drives about a point capacity pretty similar to last year. But last year you also had two points from Hawaii.","So as it stands now, should we expect more of your capacity to be generated from, easing up some of your hubs? And do you think that's positive for 2019, RASM trends, given the performance you've seen this year? Or do you think we'll start facing tougher comp issues at some point? Any color there would be really helpful.","Scott Kirby","There's a lot of moving pieces here, and we did grow Hawaii a lot in 2018. And while we like the margin results of that RASM, in that case, would have brought down the averages. So, we're going for margin. And the fact is Hawaii will have dramatically less growth for United Airlines in 2019. And that's an example of, I think, ultimately will be a tailwind to RASM year-over-year.","But Catherine, there are so many moving pieces on that front. And again, we're moving things around that, do things that boost RASM, but we're also doing things that take RASM away in the extent that they reduce the margin.","Another good example is our 787-10s flying across the Atlantic. I expect the 787-10 to replace older less efficient aircraft. And our CASM on those aircraft will fall by 10% or 15%. But our RASM is also going to fall on those aircraft by some percentage less. So, hopefully that answers your question. I think there is just an incredible number of moving pieces.","Catherine O'Brien","That makes sense. And if I could just maybe ask one more quick question on the CASMex. I just want to be sure first that we shouldn't be assuming that a new potential pilot contract is not in there. And then second, obviously, I know you can't negotiate in public. But could you offer any guideposts on how a new pilot contract could impact your 2019 CASM outlook? Have you built enough variability into that or a better, quote unquote, or do you - to keep CASM flat or do you think that we could see some CASM inflation if we got a new pilot deal?","Scott Kirby","So, keep in mind that embedded in our CASM guidance is the 4% increase the pilots receiving this year under the current contract. So that's in the number. With respect to a new contract what we committed to when we put out our multi-year CASM guidance, last year was that this would include the impact of labor increases.","Operator","From Evercore, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Congrats on the margin expansion. Your commentary about corporate bookings being up 11% last week, is the federal government included in that figure? And what would you guess your sort of percentage of volume is from the federal government?","Scott Kirby","Yes, it is included. But before I answer, we want to apologize to Brandon who got cut off or the operator cut him off. It wasn't intentional, Brandon. So if you want to get back in, please do. It includes all of our bookings. So it includes government. I don't have the exact number of what our percentage of government business is. And even if I did, it's not exactly reflective because we could tell you what's on government contract.","But we can't tell you all the contractors or partners or others that are flying in to meet with the government. So wouldn't be a meaningful number anyway. But the 11% is everything. So it includes the impact of government shutdown at least for that first week.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then just for my follow up. The four to six this year, just broad brush, I wonder if you could talk about domestic versus international, regional versus mainline, and maybe just contrast that at a high level with '18. Thanks for taking the questions.","Scott Kirby","Sure. At this point, I think a similar profile. Domestic is we're focused on our mid-continent hub strategy. We will continue to be the higher of the two numbers. And international, the lower obviously to offset that. And I'm not sure I can add any more from there. But domestic will be a little bit higher and international a little bit lower than the average. And again, it's very similar to what we did in 2018.","Operator","And from Cowen, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","So, I guess in the end, it turns out that your hearts were in the right place there. You are generating good traffic growth in each of the locations. Can you talk about the opportunities that you have in San Francisco, LA and New York that might add to growth this year, that maybe what - that you're not talking about because it's less impactful than mid-con, that will still be impactful to revenue growth?","Oscar Munoz","Helane, I'm not sure we heard your question. If I understood the bits and pieces correctly, I would say, you're asking for 2019 for our what role did our coastal gateways play in our plan?","Helane Becker","Exactly, because your growth has been focused on mid-con and yet you still have opportunities in New York, LA and San Franc because I have seen you add capacity in those markets as well. So, maybe you could just parse out the difference between the two. Sorry, I'm losing my voice here.","Scott Kirby","Well, I'd say we really do love all our hubs. And we have spoken a lot about our mid-content hub strategy, because our margin gap in the mid-continent hubs is clearly the most significant and more pressing issue for us to address and that's exactly what we're doing. But I will say that our coastal gateways are really unprecedented and they are really - they are long-term potential.","And so, I'm really excited about them, New York and Dallas on the East Coast are amazing. Having our single hub in New York City is a great advantage and we announced new service to Naples and Prague this year out of New York. And Tel Aviv out of Dallas, San Francisco, I think is the premier gateway to Asia and we've grown that as well. And we've announced new service to India and Australia out of San Francisco.","So, we will continue to focus on our mid-continent hubs for the time being. But I do want to say that over the long run, we do recognize that United's international footprint and our ability to mine that is pretty unprecedented. It's unique to United in many respects. And over the long run, I think you'll see a lot more activity there.","But in the short run, we have a problem to fix in our mid-continent hubs and we are well on our way. And we want to close that margin gap that we cited last January in those hubs and we think we're doing it as we want to do it and it's working.","Operator","And from Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski back on line. Please go ahead, sir.","Brandon Oglenski","I appreciate. But I get rejected all the time. So, this is not there for me.","Scott Kirby","Well, we are sorry. We didn't mean to.","Brandon Oglenski","Look, I guess, I was going to ask a variation on the question that's been asked couple times on the call. But you talked last year with the strategy about how United has to plug back into these small communities and we saw a lot of regional flying additions last year.","But if I look at your fleet schedule, it does look like the majority of your capacity this year is going to come from mainline aircraft additions. So, can you just talk about how does that fit into the connectivity strategy and does this increased risks that now you're maybe going up more head to head with low-fare carriers than you were maybe incrementally in '18?","Andrew Nocella","This is Andrew. The way I would describe that is our deployment of regional jets was not all that optimal and that we flew regional jets in mainline markets. So, what I think you'll see us do in 2019 is make sure that mainline markets have more often a mainline aircraft. And that will allow us to redeploy the regional aircraft into the regional catchment feeder markets.","So, I don't think that dramatically changes the profile of our client or competitiveness. It does, as you can imagine in the big market, it lowers our unit cost structure dramatically and makes those, I think, much more profitable. So, it's about getting the right aircraft in the right markets.","Our jet fleet size, I think is approximately the same. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. So, you are right. But how we deploy the aircraft really matters. And that is what I think you'll see more and more changes as we go through 2019.","Operator","And from Bernstein, we have David Vernon. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","So, Scott, a little under a year ago you laid out the rationale for the hub connectivity strategy. You identified about a 10 point margin gap in the mid-con hubs at United. Can you give us a sense for how much of that gap you guys have closed to date, and whether or not it's feasible to actually kind of get those mid-continent hubs to parity? I'm not sure if there is some geographic differences that might not sort of let that get all the way to closing the 10% gap.","Scott Kirby","We haven't actually updated that analysis. We probably will at some point. But I guess, I'd just point it to, at least, part of the relative margin performance at United where I'm doing this math in my head, but try to beat the industry on average by a couple hundred basis points on year-over-year margin last year that I would say half of that is probably from the growth strategy. And half is from all the kinds of other initiatives that we talked about today and that we continue to talk about.","So, that's probably a good indicator of how much we closed the gap so far. That would tell you that there's a lot of runway left and a lot of room to go and ultimately, I think we'll get to margins that are, at least, in the ballpark of where our competitors are.","David Vernon","Is it right to think that there might be some sort of diminishing sort of an impact of that, whether - like if some of the first network changes you made were more impactful than a later network changes or does it not work that way?","Scott Kirby","Well, I'll let Andrew add on to this. But the way it works when you grow a hub is, it's kind of a quadratic curve turned upside down. So, as you are growing, you're driving exponential connectivity, which drive margins growing fast.","So the next airplane comes in, it drives margins up. You realize you've gotten to a mature hub where you get to the point that margins at the hub start to flatten out. And that means that you're, when you get to 900,000 flights a day and you're adding the next route, the next flight and it's to a smaller and smaller place, margins start to flatten out.","At that point, you kind of know that you've gotten to a mature hub and if you keep growing then you drive margins down. But as you first start growing a hub, you start growing connectivity. It has kind of exponential growth and connectivity, which drives really strong growth in margins. And I think we're still at the early part of that curve, particularly in the mid-continent hubs.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions]","And from The Associated Press, we have David Koenig. Please go ahead.","David Koenig","I guess, this is for Scott. I'm trying to understand the 11% increase in business bookings. How much of that is repeat from existing customers? I mean, are they just - are your old customers just spending 11% more than they did a year ago, or how much of it is getting new customers, including maybe taking some away from your competitors?","Scott Kirby","I don't know is the short answer. Look, we have 11% more bookings. I'm sure some of them are new customers. I'm sure a lot of them are old customers. I think the better way to think about it as opposed to that lens is that businesses still have enough confidence to be getting out and travelling and on the road. And despite all the doom and gloom you hear, you watch CNBC in the morning, businesses aren't coming through with that.","Yes, I agree that people are nervous and they're watchful and they're waiting for something bad to happen, but it hasn't happened yet. And the economy is performing better than you would think, if you just listened to some of what people say that are worried, that could all come to pass.","But right now, the economy is performing pretty well and you just see that in strong business bookings. I suspect our competitors - this is really just a share thing. I suspect - actually, I think even Delta yesterday talked about strong demand as well. So, this is just overall strong demand.","David Koenig","And Delta put a number on the government shutdown, you didn't. Did you consider that or is the size too hard to estimate the direct and indirect effects?","Scott Kirby","Look, it's hard to estimate and we want to get ourselves focused on delivering on our earnings commitments and that's the focus.. And trying as best we can to overcome the speed bumps that gets thrown in our way. And we are starting to quantify them. It feel like now is the right way to just say, we're going to have to power through and figure out how to get done. So we didn't spend really a lot of time trying to quantify.","Operator","And from Wall Street Journal, we have Micah Maidenberg. Please go ahead.","Micah Maidenberg","How many passengers have missed United flights because of long TSA or customs line? And is there any way you can quantify how much rebooking them cost United? And then secondly, just overall, how widespread are the delays in screening, where are you seeing problems?","Greg Hart","This is Greg. We've seen pockets of staffing issues around the system, but really what's happened is it hasn't really impacted line waits all that much, and we haven't seen an impact in terms of people not being able to make their flights.","Typically, what would happen if we're having that issue is we hold the flights for those customers. And we just haven't had to do that. So the TSA has done a pretty good job of covering for it when they've seen some staffing shortages.","Micah Maidenberg","Has United deployed any of its employees to assist TSA? Delta talked about that yesterday.","Greg Hart","We have not. We do have partners who help us with some of the line management and other things that help the TSA with processing our customers. But we haven't used our own employees to do that.","Operator","Okay. And from Bloomberg, we have Justin Bachman. Please go ahead.","Justin Bachman","This question might be for Oscar or Scott. I wanted to ask about the state of the ALPHA talks in terms of the urgency for that this year, given that the pilots got a 4% raise, sort of weighed against the idea and your thoughts on flying the E170s with 70 seats on them in the future. What's the level of urgency on getting that deal done?","Scott Kirby","Look, we continue to constructive conversations with them. We have a good relationship and good partnership, and we are succeeding together but we're going to leave the negotiations at that table.","Operator","And from Reuters, we have Tracy Rucinski. Please go ahead.","Tracy Rucinski","I wanted to ask a little bit more about your use of regional aircraft as well. You mentioned that last year, the use wasn't very optimal. Regional costs have clearly gone up in part because they are having to pay more to attract pilots. Have these added costs factored into your decision not to deploy them in mainland markets this year?","Scott Kirby","This is a long-term strategy, and we want to make sure that our smallest regional aircraft are flying in short-haul catchment markets and our mainline aircraft are flying in mainline markets. We just didn't have the right fleet mix historically to do that and we still don't. This is a process that evolves over time.","So, what you'll see is fewer 50 seat regional jets, in particular, flying on routes that are between major hub cities. That's the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do two years ago. It's the right thing to do today, and we're going to do continue to execute on it. And I think that's the right way to look at it.","Tracy Rucinski","Okay. And can you give an update on your Career Path Program for pilots and generally on pilot shortages?","Greg Hart","Hey. This is Greg. We've got a program in place with a number of our partners to facilitate hiring at those regional partners as well as matriculation eventually to the mainline. It's a program that's working really well for us and we're happy with the results.","Operator","And from CNBC, we have Leslie Josephs. Please go ahead..","Leslie Josephs","You guys have been adding a lot of premium seating, business class in Polaris. What happens if there is a slowdown and just how prepared are you guys for a recession or just economic slowdown in general, given that you're putting such a focus on corporate travel and high-paying customers? Thanks.","Scott Kirby","Leslie, we watch the data, as we said several times in this call, we watch the data even more closely. We built an airline, as Gerry talked about, our very strong balance sheet. We've got incredible flexibility with the fleet.","We've built an airline that we think has a lot of resilience and flexibility in it, created a culture where we can be more quick and nimble about taking actions if we need to. And so we feel pretty good that, in the event things change in the world for the better or for the worse, that we've got the ability to respond nimbly and keep the airline running well and performing well.","Leslie Josephs","Are there any - is there anything specifics that you've toyed with, if there is a slowdown and you mentioned being quick and nimble, anything like - any color of what the airline could look like if there is a slowdown in demand?","Scott Kirby","Certainly nothing that we would talk about publicly.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now turn it back to Mike Leskinen for closing remarks.","Michael Leskinen","Thanks to all for joining the call today. Please contact media relations for any media questions. And I will be reaching out to the analysts. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"21150":["United Continental Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 18, 2017 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Oscar Munoz - CEO","Scott Kirby - President","Andrew Levy - EVP and CFO","Andrew Nocella - EVP and Chief Commercial Officer","Julie Stewart - MD, IR","Analysts","Dan McKenzie - Buckingham Research","Susan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel Nicolaus","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company","Darryl Genovesi - UBS","Kevin Crissey - Citi","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James","Andrew Didora - Bank of America","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Michael Sasso - Bloomberg","Ted Reed - The Street","Operator","Good morning and welcome to United Continental Holdings Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter 2017.

Please go ahead, Julie.","Julie Stewart","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning everyone and welcome to United's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and a separate investor update. Additionally this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our web site at ir.united.com. ","Information in yesterday's release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.

Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor update, copies of which are available on our web site.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy. In addition, we have Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart, and Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella in the room to assist with Q&A.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Julie. Good morning everyone. Thank you as always for joining us. Yesterday, we reported pre-tax earnings of $1 billion with a pre-tax margin of 10.4%, excluding special charges, as you can see on slide 4. Our earnings per share was $2.22 excluding those special charges. In the third quarter, we repurchased $556 million of stock at an average price of $67 per share, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to about $1.3 billion. Andrew Levy will provide a little more details of the financial results here shortly.","In the quarter, we certainly faced a number of challenges, including a series of historic storms and natural disasters, coinciding with the usual busy summer travel season. I have to shout out to our employees, they all impressively overcame these challenges, delivering record setting operational performance. Not only did our employees manage to keep our operations moving through these three devastating storms, they really banded together to help one another and take part in one of the largest relief and recovery efforts in United history. So I want to thank all of them, for demonstrating the level of energy and teamwork and morale, that embodies the shared purpose that we have at United.","As you know, a big driver of this new spirit at United is what we term an energized culture and really increased employee engagement around all areas, but evidenced specifically by this year's operational performance, which has been just simply outstanding. This can also be seen on how our employees are prioritizing and elevating the customer experience, and I want to highlight a few of those on slide 5 that are gaining traction. We continue to improve our mobile tool, such as in the moment care, the app that allows our employees to more quickly and effectively solve customer interruptions, such as the ones faced this quarter from the severe weather. Also to proactively address travel disruptions, we put together a team, dedicated to providing creative solutions to ensure customers reach their final destinations. They are available to all stations worldwide, 24\/6, 365 days a year.","Now evidence of progress on our customer service can be seen at the dramatic decline in the third quarter of our involuntary denied boarding or IDBs, which are down 92% over last year, and we also had a remarkable 28 days this quarter with zero IDBs. And for context prior to this year, United didn't have a single day with zero IDBs.","Now if you look at the business more broadly, we do feel good about over accomplishing at United, but we also know that we have a long journey and a lot of hard work ahead of us to realize our potential. The third quarter was a challenging environment, probably due to macro events such as the storms I mentioned, as well as things like geopolitical tensions, causing softer demand out of Guam, but we have also made a strategic decision to compete aggressively with ultra low cost carriers, which is essential to the long term health of our business. So today -- earlier, we promised the investment community an update on our 2016 Investor Day initiatives, Scott will do that in a moment. At a high level, our Investor Day initiatives are on track, with the exception of segmentation, where incremental contribution was temporarily offset by broad competitive issues.","And also, new issues have arisen this year, and our goal is to produce meaningful, absolute and relative margin improvement, that is something that remains steadfast in our focus. And as we continue on this journey, it's critical for us ensuring that we properly prepare for and mitigate the headwinds that we cannot control, which are often many, correct through the ones we can control and we have to be able to distinguish between both of those. And so, we know we can control how we implement our initiatives like basic economy. We know we can control how we control our new revenue management system, and we certainly have control over the pricing mix that we are doing right now with ULCC. And that is what we are doing.","In addition, we are taking a very-very rigorous approach to reviewing our costs, as we look forward into 2018 beyond our planning process.","So that's the general update of our quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Scott for some more details.","Scott Kirby","Thank you, Oscar, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I am going to take a slightly different approach this quarter. We will start by providing the traditional brief revenue update and spend some time, talking about how the business has evolved over the last year.","Turning to the revenue environment, our PRASM was 3.7 points lower year-over-year, and this included about a point of storm impact. Domestic unit revenues were weaker than our initial expectations due to the storms. More aggressive ULCC pricing in our hub markets, and temporary share loss during our initial basic economy roll out.","PRASM performance in the Atlantic and Latin regions was in line with our expectations. The Pacific was a lot weaker than we initially expected and declined more than 10%, due to softer demand in China, Hong Kong and Guam. And while Guam is only around 1.5% of our ASOs, demand to Guam has seen a very sharp decline, and we are scaling back service between Guam and the markets in Asia.","Looking forward, we anticipate fourth quarter PRASM to be down 1% to 3%. We expect October and November to be close to flat, which obviously implies a large forecast PRASM decline for December. For what it's worth and in some of the analyst reports, that doesn't imply that December will be down exactly minus 6, we'd say close to flat in October and November, doesn't mean it's exactly zero, and the midpoint of our guidance minus 2. There is a lot of rounding in all of those numbers.","However, our forecast for December really is driven by the calendar, and in fact, the Christmas outbound starts a lot later this year. A lot of schools, including my own kid, don't get out until December 22nd. That means two things, first, the off peak period between thanksgiving and Christmas, which is the lowest RASM period of the year, that extended by a week. And second, much of the holiday return is pushed into January. So a lot of uncertainty around our December forecast, but our forecast PRASM decline really isn't about anything systemic, it's just the vagaries of the calendar.","Now I'd take a step back and look at 2017, which has been a difficult year for United. We started the year focused on several key areas, improving the operations, which includes improving the culture for our employees and customers, rebuilding our network in a profit maximizing way, and executing on our Investor Day initiatives, as we work towards our goal of improving absolute and relevant margins.","Turning to slide 9, our operations team continues to do a truly phenomenal job. This quarter was a great example and despite experiencing some devastating storms, our team and all the employees of United were able to rally together, keep the operation moving and deliver top tier operational performance.","As challenging as the recovery efforts were, we continue to set new company records in the operation. We managed to set the best ever third quarter consolidated departures within zero, with the month of September having the best ever month in a consolidated D0. We also set a record for the best ever Star D0, which is the first flight to depart beginning of the day, and they set the stage for success throughout the day.","Following second quarter's industry leading departure performance, third quarter D0 was second best in the industry among our peers. This type of operational performance is really outstanding, particularly given the four day closure at our Houston Hub. We have the lowest rate of consolidated airport operations and flight operations delays ever. These records show how committed we are to making United the best in class airline and how resilient our operation has become.","A big driver of our operational improvement is the energized culture and increased employee engagement that Oscar talked about earlier. Operational performance is evidence that our employees are prioritizing, elevating the customer experience.","On the network, we put some key faces -- some new faces and few leadership positions, and are really just getting started on our network improvement. Consistent with what we outlined this Investor Day, our top priority in the network is to strengthen our hub. We started over the summer by improving the competitiveness of our product and schedule, in October, later this month, we will re-bank Houston Hub, and in 2018 we expect to re-bank Chicago and Denver.","Lastly, on Investor Day, all our initiatives are duly performing as expected, with the exception of segmentation, due to temporary competitive headwinds from the basic economy rollout. Our basic economy roll-out will dwell operationally, but from a revenue perspective, it started out right. Now that we are competing with similar projects from our large competitors, we are hopeful, segmentation will start to contribute, as we originally thought it would.","We are in the early stages of our revenue management improvements, and we are encouraged by the initial results. We continue to optimize our yield management posture in our new system, which is called Gemini, is rolling out to plan. Initial results in test markets are encouraging, showing large improvements in forecast accuracy and a 1% projected improvement in RASM.","Internally, we have a lot of work left to do on the yield management system, but I am really proud of the team, and look forward to doing a full deployment in 2018.","Despite the momentum in these initiatives, as you can see in our results, they have been offset. Higher costs from labor and fuel, combined with revenue headwinds in the second half of the year, more than offset the value of our initiatives in 2017. Some of those headwinds we have talked about, include ULCT pricing, which is a strategic decision that we know is the right long term decision for United, as well as exogenous events like an unprecedented series of storms, softer demand in China, Hong Kong and tensions around Guam.","In summary, we feel really good about things in our control. Many of our initiatives are long-tailed and we are headed in the right direction. As Andrew will mention shortly, we are also taking a very hard look at our cost base, which is an important driver of our ability to improve margins going forward.","Turning around the operation, driving cultural change and improving our networking product and improving the customer experience, are all things that are important to our ability to build a great airline. While there have been some bumps in the road in 2017, we are on our path to achieve our financial goal, and we will work to navigate through unforeseen challenges along the way.","I will turn it over to Andrew now for the financial results.","Andrew Levy","Thanks Scott. Yesterday afternoon, we released our third quarter 2017 earnings and our fourth quarter investor update. I will discuss both our results and outlook at a high level, and please refer to those documents for additional detail.","Slide 12 is a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 13, shows our non-GAAP results. We reported earnings per share of $2.22, excluding special charges and pre-tax income of $1 billion, which represented a 10.4% pre-tax margin excluding special charges.","Turning to slide 15, non-fuel unit costs increased 2.6% on a year-over-year basis, which was at the better end of our September 6 updated guidance, mostly due to the timing of certain maintenance events that will appear in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter non-fuel CASM mix to be higher year-over-year by 2.5% to 3.5%, which brings projected full year 2017 non-fuel CASM mix to the high end of our prior guidance of between 2.5% to 3.5%. There are four principal drivers that have changed, since we issued that range.","First is Harvey, where we continue to incur many costs including some additional costs, extraordinary costs, despite lost ASMs. Second is at our maintenance operation, where we experienced more high cost maintenance visits than we had forecast earlier this year. Third, is higher depreciation and amortization expense, which is mostly driven by changes made to our depreciable life assumptions for our fleet, to ensure consistency across some fleets, and changes to salvage values. It is also higher, because we continue to purchase aircraft off-lease, which has driven higher D&A expense, with the future offset in rent savings. Lastly, we had additional expense associated with new regional flying that started in September. While this additional 50 seat flying comes with additional ASM expense, it does enable us to execute our strategy of increasing [indiscernible] flying to smaller cities, from places like Chicago.","We understand how critical cost control is to 2018 and the team is doing a ton of work to identify opportunities to improve cost performance, as part of the budgeting process. These range from flying the network in more cost efficient ways to reevaluating why we spend money in certain areas that have always been that way. At the same time, we know there are some headwinds in 2018. While we don't have the same pressure from new labor contracts that we had in 2016 and 2017, we do face some headwinds, such as a higher mix of 50 seat flying, rising medical and dental costs, higher pension expense and rising airport rates and charges, all of which we are working to overcome.","Turning to slide 16, we ended the third quarter with $6.3 billion of unrestricted liquidity, which includes our $2 billion of untapped revolver. We are comfortable in excess of our stated liquidity target range of $5 billion to $6 billion and our balance sheet remains strong.","During the quarter, we raised $400 million of unsecured debt, at an interest rate of 4.25%. We also contributed $160 million to our pension plans and that brings us to our expected contribution of $400 million for full year 2017.","Turning to slide 17; during the quarter, we repurchased $556 million of our shares at an average price of just over $67, bringing our year-to-date repurchases through the third quarter of 2017 to $1.3 billion. Cumulatively, since we began repurchasing shares in the third quarter of 2014, we have invested $5.4 billion to buy back our stock, retiring 26% of our shares outstanding. As of the end of the quarter, we have $553 million remaining of repurchase authority. For 2017, we continue to expect adjusted capital expenditures to be between $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion.","As we announced in early September, during the quarter, we finalized negotiations for our A350 order. We are pleased to have reached a great outcome for United-Airbus and [indiscernible]. There are three key changes; first, on timing. We have deferred deliveries by four years to begin in late 2022, and they will continue through 2027. Second, we will take the A350-900 instead of the larger A350-1000 variant. Third, we added 10 aircraft for a total order size of 45 aircraft. The delivery timing, model type and order size are all a better fit for our future wide body fleet needs, that allow these aircraft to have used for either growth or for a potential replacement for 777-200ER aircraft, as this subfleet will begin to approach retirement age, around the same time you start taking delivery of the A350s. Finally during the quarter, we finalized agreements to take two additional A320s in 2017 sourced from the used market.","Slide 18 is a summary of our current guidance, including fourth quarter's projected fuel price range, using the October 12 curve. The range provided for capacity, revenue and costs imply a fourth quarter pre-tax margin between 3% and 5%.","Looking forward, cost control is an integral component of our path to margin improvement, and as I mentioned earlier, we are in the middle of our 2018 budgeting process and taking a very rigorous approach to stem future cost inflation.","With that, I will turn it back to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you. I just want to thank once again to our employees, our customers, and certainly our investors. I think as Scott mentioned, there have been some bumps in the road in 2017, but we are on a path to achieve our financial goals, and we will work hard to navigate through any unforeseen challenges that come along the way. But at the end of the day, we are excited about our path forward, and just try to reward all of you along the way.","So with that, let me turn it over to Julie and we are happy to take your questions.","Julie Stewart","Thank you, Oscar. First, we will take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question, and if needed, one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And from Buckingham, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks. Scott, I guess the first question really is for you. There is a lot of noise in the revenue trend for the third and fourth quarter, which makes it a little hard to think about core underlying revenue trends. And so, if we just go back and strip out acts of mother nature and other idiosyncratic stuff, how are you thinking about the true core steady state revenue trends sequentially? Are they getting better, worse or going sideways?","Oscar Munoz","Yeah, I agree. Dan, it's really hard to strip out. There is so much that happened in third quarter this year, with the stuff that's happening in the fourth quarter this year, and stuff that happened last year in H1. So I think that the core trends are largely the same. The third quarter wasn't as bad as it appeared, is mostly what that means, and as you go into the fourth quarter, it's more representative of what the real demand trend is. The one thing that I think is improving, at least for United in particular, is we had in late of July, a huge change in the pricing philosophy at one of our ultra low-cost carrier competitors, that was a big shock to the system. Where walk-up fares wound up going down over the course of a week or two by 80% or 90%, and that takes little time to adjust to. While fares remain at those levels, we are better at managing in that environment, I think today, and will be in the fourth quarter than we were before.","But if you sort through all the bad stuff that happened; I think, that the fourth quarter is a little bit better than the third quarter, even on core underlying trends. Mostly due to the changes we have made in being able to manage better, and the pricing that has remained consistent with the ULCC, and there is also less industry capacity in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, particularly as Southwest is growing less.","Dan McKenzie","I see. Thanks for that. And I guess, if I can go back to the ultra low cost carrier pricing just for a second; I know, at the time of our last earnings call, that was impacting 3% of our revenue. And I think that that stepped up and impacted a bigger percent in the quarter. How has that progressed? Is it still affecting a larger portion of the revenue base than it was at the time of our last earnings call, or how is that -- as we think about that heading into 2018?","Oscar Munoz","Yeah, it is. At the last United earnings call, we didn't -- I don't think we talked about Spirit, at least at all, and really didn't think much of it. But of course, the day after their earnings call, fare has been down dramatically, and it continues to go down dramatically. And so it did spread. It has kind of been constant I would say, for the last six to eight weeks, where fares got down to -- walk-up fares as low as $10 and that $10 including the online convenience fee or whatever they call those fees, which are lower than ever seen, and including the time that we were engaged in stuff like this, like my prior employer. But they have been -- they haven't gone up, but they haven't gone down. If you want to get down to $10 at the walk-up fare, there is not much room to go down, particularly when that fare started at $170 two months ago.","So really not much change. There is a higher percentage of markets that are involved in the really low fares. The percentage build out 17% of our revenue that comes from markets where ULCCs fly, but the amount that is exposed to this kind of pricing -- that's of the domestic system by the way. But the amount that's exposed to this pricing is obviously less than that, it's 100% right now.","Dan McKenzie","Okay, thank you. Appreciate that.","Operator","From Macquarie Capital, we have Susan Donofrio. Please go ahead.","Susan Donofrio","Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted a follow-up on Dan's question, and that is, you talked a little bit about better managing against ULCC pricing. I am just wondering, is that because you are getting more comfortable with some of your new pricing levers, to as far as fine tuning basic economy, and also, your new yield management system? I mean, how can we kind of think about that? Because I am looking at markets, and it definitely looks like you are not as widespread with respect to some of the pricing initiatives?","Oscar Munoz","Yeah. There is a whole bunch of things, Susan, that are going on. One, basic economy is a great tool and we have been experimenting with the difference of price between basic economy and standard economy. It's not really the new yield management system yet, but it will be, and we have got some really cool stuff going on that we are experimenting with, that will roll into the new yield management system, that can be particularly targeted in these markets.","One of the big things that changed is, for us, in this environment is, actually the impact on flow traffic. And so as the fares go down like this, we are selling a lot more local demand on some of these flights, and what happens is, we wind up spilling off connecting revenues. And that takes a little time to adjust to. What we do essentially is, we are going to be selling more seats in the local market, will continue and that maintains that competitive posture in the head-to-head local competitive markets. But we continued our yield management posture on the connecting flows, because essentially we have now fewer seats to sell in some of those connecting flows.","But there is improvement in the local market with the connecting markets or places we can improve as well. And we have far more data today than we would have had a few years ago, to help us manage this and we also have, as you mentioned, the tools, basic economy, that's a real help. That in the very short term of things, when fares go down by 90% over the course of two weeks, that takes a little time to adjust it, but we are getting a lot more adjusted, as we go forward.","Susan Donofrio","Okay, great. Well thank you.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning everybody. Scott, a question in the hypothetical, if you are given the chance to renegotiate one contract from scratch, but you were given a choice between the current Chase credit card agreement in the existing alliance contract with Air Canada and Lufthansa. Which would you pick? I am just thinking longer term, which of these two, unless you think there is a third more material option, might afford the greatest amount of potential margin upside, that sort of thing?","Oscar Munoz","Yeah, you are trying to box me out. So I will say there is opportunities on both. In dollar value, the larger opportunity, and it's not necessarily renegotiation, but the larger opportunity is absolutely with our credit card partner, Chase. And we are working on that. This is my and Andrew Nocella's third or fourth time through one of these, and also on the people on the Chase side, not their first time going through something like this with a partner. We had great success in the past, getting to win-win situations with our bank partners, and I believe and hope that we will get there with Chase. On both sides, we are seeing all the right things. We are big organizations that don't move -- both big organizations that don't move overnight. That has been true everywhere else that I have been as well. And I think that we will get to, ultimately, a much better result.","And it is certainly -- it's a great partnership, but it is a disadvantage, as we sit here today compared to our competitors, and one that has a lot of opportunity. We also have opportunity on the Alliance front, and it's not so much about renegotiation of JVs, it's about realizing the potential of the JVs and on that front, all of our partners are engaged and anxious, and we are making real progress, both in South America and across the Atlantic in particular. We today are getting better results in those geographies than we otherwise would, even though we haven't done a new deal, just because we are working much closer together, and we are [indiscernible] to the line and feel good on both of those fronts that we are going to have improvements. The credit card deal is obviously bigger.","Jamie Baker","Got it. And the second question, on the topic of 'natural share.' Is it possible to quantify the progress that you have made or that you expect to make by, I don't know, call it summer of next year. Are you going to be half way there, 10%, 90%? And also, does re-banking help contribute to natural share in your model, or is achieving natural share strictly exercising growth? Obviously, I am trying to back in to when your capacity might moderate back to something closer to the industry average?","Scott Kirby","So I am not going to be able to give you an answer today on what the ultimate end-game on capacity is. But re-banking does help with natural share -- when we talk about natural share. It means, not just our share at our hub, it actually frankly means more our share and all of the non-hub cities around the country, so at Des Moines or wherever. And winning your share in Des Moines is not about carrying people from Des Moines to Chicago, it's about carrying people from Des Moines to the world. And what we have, a less efficient hub structure in Chicago, when we fly those people to Des Moines and we miss 10 or 15 connecting markets, then we lose out on share in a place like Des Moines, that would just be natural if we had a hub structure that worked better.","So some of what we are doing to regain that -- a huge part of what we are going to regain natural share, is re-banking the hubs and driving higher levels of connectivity, which will increase your share at a market like Des Moines, without having to increase capacity.","Jamie Baker","Makes sense. Thanks a lot Scott, appreciate it.","Scott Kirby","Yes","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Yeah, thank you. So Scott, the 4Q guidance implies full year operating margin of about 9.5% if you adjust for the weather in 3Q. By my math, about 3.5 points to that is from selling miles to chase, so why shouldn't I be worried that at 3% GDP and $50, the core airline business is only earning at a 6% EBIT margin. Does that type of return require different strategy than what you are pursuing right now?","Scott Kirby","Well, one, you can't divorce those two things from each other.","Joseph DeNardi","Well, to be fair Scott, last quarter, when you said that you are -- you have about 0.5% margin gap versus American because of your deal?","Scott Kirby","Well, I am saying you can't divorce those two things from each other, because one of the disadvantages that we have and that Chase has, is that if you are living in Des Moines, Iowa, and you are picking a credit card, and we are the number three player in Des Moines, Iowa, you are more likely to pick one of the other two. And that is not incumbent just on a Chase fix, but on us to help address. So part of winning back natural share is not just about the core airline business, it is also about improving credit card business.","And I think of those two as fundamentally tied together. It is true that a big part of our earnings, and I am not agreeing necessarily with your numbers. But a big part of our earnings comes from selling miles. But that is a core part of the business, and you can't say strip that out, and then watch your growth fee at the airline. That said, we do think that there is opportunity to improve that part of the business, and it's one of the big areas that we are focused on. We can't do a -- well there are some things that we can do unilaterally. But we are working with our partners, but Chase is by far the biggest, and working with them to get results that look like our competitors. And I think both of us agree, actually both United Airlines and Chase believe that we can do that and that we can get to a world that's good for Chase and good for United Airlines that generates the same kind of results and we are marching towards that. It will not happen overnight, but we are moving in that direction, and I think we will eventually get there.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Andrew, it looks like you guys recently made some changes to mileage plus award valuations, you had increased the price on some saver awards, added a fee to cancel. It seems like those decisions benefit the airline business, because the miles flow through at a better rate, but they effectively devalue the currency for consumers. So how far can you push that, before people stop signing up for the card, and why shouldn't I be worried that, unless your disclosures improve and the transparency gets better, the marketing company won't continue to subsidize the airlines?","Andrew Levy","We have made some changes. We have gone through a dynamic type of pricing environment. But we have been really careful on how we do that, to make sure that our customers still see a great value. And I don't think that has changed here. There were a few price points that went up. But there are not many price points that are actually lower, as they reflect the true availability on particular flights. So I don't think what we did over the last two weeks is going to change the dynamics at all.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Oh yeah. Hey everyone, good morning. Just I guess, two quick ones here. Andrew, you talked about pension expense being a headwind in 2018. How does the expense in 2018 at this point, how does that compare to 2017 and then how does the expense compare to what your anticipated contribution will be in 2018? Do you have a sense on that?","Andrew Levy","Yeah Mike, it's about $70 million of inflation that we are expecting at this point in time. Some of that is based on a forecasted discount rate, which we can only forecast at this point or actuaries can only forecast. That will get kind of locked down at the end of the year. So at the moment, a little over half of that is due to forecasted lower discount rate applied, and the balance would be lower mortality and expenses associated with that.","Michael Linenberg","And then just the contribution, I guess it was what, $400 million this year. For next year, what should we expect?","Andrew Levy","Mike, historically, we are kind of hesitant to give anything on 2018 just yet. But we will certainly talk about $400 million a year, and at this point, I don't see any reason to expect that number will be much different next year. It will depend on a number of factors. I think it's safe to assume, it will be similar to what we did this year.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. And then just to Scott, the PRASM forecast for the fourth quarter. How much of it is FX? Is there an FX boost in there that we should see?","Scott Kirby","It's pretty small, a quarter -- about 25 basis points of tailwind.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. Thanks Scott.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Thanks. Good morning. I think I have two questions for Oscar. Oscar, if we put aside any relative comparisons to your competitors, for your margins to go up next year, with current fuel, your RASM has to be something like 40 or 50 basis points better than your CASM ex-fuel. So I am asking you now, will that happen? And if you want to put that -- answer a different question, would you say United is a RASM or CASM story in 2018, and I would encourage you not to say both?","Oscar Munoz","Well I appreciate the encouragement Hunter. I think we are a margin company, as we happen for -- I think focused on that for quite some time. You know, I think it is a good opportunity for us to just discuss the broad advancements that we made as a company, with a strategy and a management team and a focus that, I think, holds for a very bright future.","I think the interim periods are difficult to discuss, because we are making investments. We are -- I think the way I said it earlier is, we have dug ourselves historically in a little bit of a competitive hole as a company. And in order to get ourselves out of it, we have to do something a little bit extraordinary than others. And so, that's what we are focused on. We are focused on doing that, but at the same time, from a long term perspective, on margin capability.","So as we head into 2018, one of the reasons we are not talking too much about it, we are deep, deep at work with regards to that. How do we get the kind of growth that has good margin, and how do we get into the bowels [ph] of our cost structure and ensure that we make that. And so it is about the net margin number. And so it's a difficult period for us, as we work through all this information. This team has only been in place really for a year, and we are just getting our mojo working. And again, I think Scott said it from -- with regards to our initiatives are long tailed, and what you see, vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, is that they have been together as a team and with their focus and their initiatives for quite some time, and they are beginning to see the benefits of that. We just have a little bit more work to do, and we will continue to ask for a little bit more patience. But there is no change with regards to where we think our relative and absolute margin improvement need to be, to compete in this industry.","Hunter Keay","Okay. All right. But I think people are really trying to buy into this story, because they believe there is a CASM story here, at least I was. And the excess capacity growth has not translated in a better CASM ex, despite the fact that your ops are better. Higher completion factor drove a lot of the CASMB or the ASMB. And yes there were some onetime items in 1Q, I get that. But how can we have any confidence in the 2018 CASM ex story, particularly given the headwind that you guys went out of your way to lay out on this call? So can you at least may be bracket in like a high end of CASM ex for us, so we have some sense how to think about you guys in this next year?","Oscar Munoz","Not today. And trust me, we are not telling you because we don't want to; we are, as Andrew Levy talked about, deep in the middle of this stuff. In fact, I just saw the thick book that was on Scott's desk that I went through briefly yesterday, we are taking a very different approach that Andrew Levy has taken us through, with regards to some of this. And again, we need to ensure that we [indiscernible] through the detail before we probably can tell you anything at this point. So let us keep working through this, I just need a little bit more time. We have always been about proof, not promise, and so right now, it's going to look a little more promising and the proof will come, as we get more into the details of this.","Hunter Keay","Thank you.","Operator","From Cowen and Company we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks operator. I appreciate the time. Hi guys. So here is my two questions; one is, I think, relatively easy question. When you think about Scott, the ultra low cost carriers that you are competing against, are you just talking about domestic or are you including international in there, so that if you look at like Newark-Athens as an example, I think Emirates is in there, and they would be considered a low fare airline, maybe not low cost. So can you parse out what the impact of something like that would be on your business?","Scott Kirby","So we have the same approach to all competitors, low cost or not. Emirates is a unique example, we feel really good about our ability to compete with ultra low cost carriers domestically or with the ex-Air Berlin or Norwegian or anyone like that, that has a -- that is not subsidized by the government. Emirates is a completely different story, because they are subsidized by their government. And we can compete, and think we can compete effectively and win against anyone, but we can't compete against governments. So our best approach to competition is the same everywhere we fly, but you have brought up a unique example of a subsidized carrier, that is unfair competition.","Helane Becker","But is it -- aren't China Easter and China Southern subsidized as well?","Scott Kirby","I don't know. It's really not the same extent, and certainly they are not allowed to do things like fly from Newark to Athens.","Helane Becker","Okay, fair enough. Okay, that's great. Okay, I think that was it. One question, one follow-up. Thank you.","Scott Kirby","Thank you, Helane.","Operator","And from UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Scott, when you rolled out basic economy, you would have been forced to choose some spreads between how you price basic economy and how you price your regular economy product. I would imagine that early on, that spread is somewhat of a guess, and as you gain more experience with this, I mean, I guess, would you expect to be revenue managing that spread over time, and could you envision a scenario where it's much different than it is today?","Scott Kirby","Yes, is the short answer, and we are already doing that in a number of markets. So we do think that there is an opportunity there, and we are experimenting with that, as we sit here today.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then I guess on some of your longer term initiatives, I think you said the only one that was behind, was the segmentation initiative. I guess, if I looked at the chart that you showed in November, I think you showed about an incremental $1.4 billion from these initiatives ticking in next year. Should we be thinking of that number as still largely representative of your view of how these initiatives sort of play out altogether in total?","Scott Kirby","Well, we are trying to get away from being quite that prescriptive. But we do think that we are largely on track with the exception of segmentation, that we are largely on track with those initiatives. It's also important I think to point out that, the Investor Day initiatives, while we felt we went out of our way to say that these are -- versus what would have happened, had we not done them, but that they were not absolute increases compared to the prior year numbers. A lot of people interpreted that in a different way. And what that means is, there are other things that could be headwinds or at least, it could be tailwinds. This year we have more headwinds, things like Asia. I am hopeful that Asia next year, will actually be a tailwind, because those kinds of geography driven issues ebb and flow around the world. But we do believe that we are -- basically, with the exception of segmentation on track or everything that we talked about, timing maybe a little earlier or a little later on different ones, we had some of that this year, although they are largely balanced out, with the exception of segmentation. But we think that we are on track for these initiatives.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. I think that's an interesting perspective about what you just said about, people sort of taking these to meet -- to be something absolute versus something incremental, what you otherwise would have done. If I look at the 2018 consensus, earnings before tax number, it's about $3.1 billion, which is actually below the $3.2 billion that you have in this presentation from initiatives, which you would imply that the three kind of things that you would be breakeven or even at operating at a modest loss, without these initiatives?","Scott Kirby","Yeah. You got a bunch of numbers that are kind of apples or oranges that we neither endorse nor don't endorse. So yeah, you did the analysis, but I am not sure I'd agree with the conclusion, because I am not sure I agree with all the input numbers.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Citi, we have Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey","Hey, thank you for the time. I am going to follow-up on Darryl's because that was essentially the question I was going to go with. If we are not going to use those specific numbers, and I understood. I think we tried to understand at the time that those numbers were relative to what you would have otherwise done. And I think Darryl's point is fair, that given the results and being on track mostly, it implies that the company was going to have some tough times, were it not for these initiatives. What I am hoping to do is, maybe give you guys an opportunity to tell us, reframe this in a different way. Coming and saying we are on track for these initiatives, but don't mind these numbers, doesn't feel right. It feels like you need to like reset expectations, whether it'd be not giving specific numbers for individual initiatives, or somehow saying, resetting a bar here for these initiatives; because I don't think those numbers mean very much to anyone anymore, they seem very optimistic, and there must have been some significant headwinds that we were unaware of.","So maybe I am hoping for you to give us an opportunity to come up with more specific reason, how are these initiatives going to play out? You got the gist of my question I guess?","Scott Kirby","I am not sure I actually do understand the questions, but it sounds like you want to give a new set of numbers that you believe?","Kevin Crissey","Well yeah, I mean, those numbers are -- [indiscernible], it's like $1.4 billion between 2017 and 2018, and we will back out segmentation entirely and call it $1 billion. I don't know what $1 billion headwind year-over-year should be there, that we shouldn't be able to attack those on. So if you are on track with these initiatives, why aren't we adding $1 billion? And I don't think that's the right number. So therefore, these numbers are not terribly useful. So what I am looking for is kind of more useful numbers.","Scott Kirby","Okay. Look, we are not going to redo the Investor Day numbers on this call today. As I think through what the Investor Day initiatives are, the network initiatives, we feel good about; we are going to redo Houston Banking, a lot of this is about the re-banking structures, we are doing Houston on October 29. Chicago and Denver are going to be a little bit later than we originally planned, just as we work through all the operational stuff on that. The fleeting is going to be a little bit different next year, because we just have changes in the fleet plans with 50 seaters. MileagePlus should go up, we had a hit this year from MileagePlus that was related in the old deal, we are paying back, essentially it's a loan. Not to classify it as a loan, but it was essentially a loan. We are paying back miles at a lower rate, that was pretty straightforward. Should happen. I talked about the revenue management stuff in my opening commentary, we feel pretty good about that, got it delivered, and there is a lot of water that still has to go under the bridge on that. We feel good about that one. And we are doing a lot of work on the cost stuff. I think that we will do well there.","Headwinds remain, the overall macro environment that applies to everyone. The ULCC environment, and they are talking about some of the cost headwinds. We don't know for sure what the Pacific will do next year. But we kind of walk through each one of those. I am not sure the -- I don't have an exact number to update on today, but on those initiatives, we feel pretty good about, because they bring on those initiatives.","Oscar Munoz","And Kevin, this is Oscar, I think you raise a great point, and we understand it completely. And I think the conundrum is, how do we give you a sense of the results of these long tailed initiatives and provide you a little bit better transparency. And so, it's a good point. It is what we are in the middle of today, trying to understand -- not only understand, trying to better understand these issues and how they play out. Given all the things that have changed since we have given those things. So we need to package all that together, and that's what we are doing, as we put together our plan. But again, I just want to make sure, I understand your point completely as of the rest of the team, and thank you for that admonition. Appreciate it.","Kevin Crissey","Thanks. Maybe it's for Scott, can you talk about -- I know you are probably not going to give specific capacity guidance for 2018, but how do you think about it and the need to -- how do you think about capacity growth for 2018 overall?","Scott Kirby","Look, we are still going through it, and it's driven by a view of what's going to maximize our margin performance. And every day we are just trying to do that. And so we look at anything either additive or subtractive, it's about what the margin of RASM is going to be and what the margin of CASM is going to be.","Kevin Crissey","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth. Please go ahead.","Savanthi Syth","Hey, good morning. Scott, I might have missed this, did you talk about what you expect regional trends to be that's kind of embedded in the 4Q guidance?","Scott Kirby","We didn't talk about it, but we -- essentially, there are some onetime things that happened last year, that are going to cause our reported results to differ slightly from what I am going to say. But the core performance is going to be that, Domestic and Atlantic are our two best regions we think and do better. Pacific will probably have the largest improvement, despite the fact that Guam is terrible. For core Pacific, we are at least forecasting it's going to improve. And Latin will continue to be strong, but as it overlaps the recovery and the sharp improvements in RASM last year, on a year-over-year basis, we expect it to be less strong.","Savanthi Syth","Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And Andrew, if I might quickly ask you, I know you realized on -- your focus on liquidity targets, but could you share your thinking on, how you think about debt levels and the use of cash here?","Andrew Levy","Well, you know Savi, our view on the balance sheet is unchanged. We certainly like to see a higher rating of our debt. But we feel very comfortable with where we are. We have not decided to try for investment grade. We may decide one day, that that is something that's worth doing. But at the moment, we are very comfortable with our debt levels. We are able to raise capital at extremely attractive rates, and we are very comfortable with where we are in the balance sheet, which is taking into account, not just debt levels but also the liquidity and the active capital that we have.","Savanthi Syth","All right. Thank you.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning everyone. Scott, there is obviously a lot of seasonality in your business, but the pre-tax margins in 4Q and 1Q, that can -- significantly below 2Q and 3Q, yet much more so than some many other airlines out there. Is there anything you are doing or can do to help mitigate this? Has it been something in terms of how you focus new capacity or maybe even the re-banking of the hubs? Or anything that you are doing in order to kind of fix this seasonality?","Scott Kirby","Well we are going to have higher seasonality than the others. Driven by the fact that we are a more business oriented airline and we have less exposure to Florida and the Caribbean, which for the less exposure of Florida and the Caribbean, means that our first quarters are relatively weaker. Our seasonality is going to be higher. We are working on -- another thing that we do that's unique, our peaks are higher and our valleys are lower, and should we change those two variables to help with costs. That drives higher CASM at United. But it's easy to say that, and it's harder to go through all the analysis and some work to address it. But I do think over the coming years, you will see us with less variability in our seasonal scheduling, which should be a cost benefit. But we are in the early stages of figuring that out. But we will always have higher seasonality, because we have lower exposure to Florida and the Caribbean.","Andrew Didora","Understood. Look I know, in terms of 2018 CASM, you are obviously not prepared to talk about that right now. But just at Investor Day, you did speak about 2018 to 2020 unit cost CAGR of sub-1% on just 1.5% capacity. I would say, you grew much faster than this in 2018. But with the headwinds Andrew that you kind of outlined in your prepared remarks, do you think this CASM outlook that you provided last November is at risk right now?","Andrew Levy","So we are just not prepared to talk about 2018. Look, there is a lot that's happened, a lot of changes that have happened since we provided that forecast over a year ago. We are working through it right now, and it's not as simple as you grow more CASM-ex goes down. I mean, on an Excel spreadsheet it does, but there is a lot of inputs. Some of them have nothing to do with, whether you grow fast or not. I mentioned one of them, airport rates. When airport rental rates go up, it doesn't matter how much you fly, you just pay more, and there is a ton of other costs then, some of which do go down when you fly more. As you fly more with aircraft utilization, it drives down your membership cost on a PRASM basis. But there is a ton of inputs. We are going through all that, and we are just not ready to give detailed commentary on 2018 for costs.","We are in the middle of our budget process, we are going at it in a very-very detailed way in trying to get to the best answer we can get to, that's going to maximize margin for United, and we will comment on that further when we are ready to.","Oscar Munoz","This is Oscar again; again I just -- and I know this won't help matters much, but I know everybody is getting scared about the fact that we are not going to give these numbers, because of some ominous reason. I cannot fully express to you, how much in the middle of things that we are. We historically have had a lot of talented people with a lot of experience in this industry, who know their relationships and how they are supposed to work, and we also have a very-very large company, with a lot of places that we are digging into. And so, let us do a little bit more of that work, and when we come out of it, we will be able to sort of provide you some better information around what we are thinking.","Operator","Okay. From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning everyone and thank you for taking my question. And look, I try not to be too critical on these things, but I have just heard a lot of conflicting comments today, so I do want to poise my question this way. So Oscar, you have been in the transportation business for quite some time now, you know a lot of the investors here probably more than a decade. And you know that, when you point out public statements about earnings improvement or efficiency targets, people are going to measure you against those. And so, when you put in your slide today, that Investor Day initiatives are generally performing as expected. But then we hear on the call, we don't really want to focus on those numbers. You guys are drawing the focus there and then saying, we shouldn't be focused on it. So I guess, I just want to focus on your comments that, you said on the call, I am focused on absolute and relative earnings performance. When I look at your absolute earnings, they are down more than your competitors. Your relative margin gap is widening, not narrowing, and more importantly for the investors on this call, the stock is now down, call it 20% to 25% versus the market this year.","So from an investor perspective, what is it that happened this year, that we didn't anticipate at the Investor Day last year? We knew a lot of the labor costs are going to be here? And what is going to incrementally drive positive change for your shareholders, where we can start to address some of these absolute and relative gaps? And can you commit to driving higher margins in 2018, barring some sort of change in the macro?","Oscar Munoz","Hey Brandon. Again, the things that I have changed, I think we have noted and discussed, A. B, it's hard to prove to you how well some of our initiatives have worked. The fact that they are working, and the headwinds have been significant. The inconsistencies that I think you are picking up, are just a function of time and structure. We are in the middle of planning process. It is a quarter that we just had and a quarter that follows, and we are really getting to the bottom of all these things. So I wish I had more information to share with you at this point. We are committed to the things that we've said, the absolute relative margin growth. It's just in this interim period, we are having some difficulties explaining this to you clearly, and we get that. That is still a little bit more work, and as we get better clarity on the things that we are doing, we will do what's required to make sure that we regain the trust. But more importantly, beyond the communication and quarterly update, I think the execution of all these initiatives is something we have to continue to focus on. And so, I appreciate your concern and your pointed question and appreciate your sentiment. And we will just move forward.","Brandon Oglenski","Well if you don't mind, I just want to follow-up; because you did mention you are going to control what you can. And in your opening comments, I think you mentioned revenue management, your role of economy basic, mention of the fair structure of ULCCs. But notably absent from that -- and now listen, I live in an Excel spreadsheet, right? I don't run errands, I am not trying to say, I know better than you guys. But at a simplistic level, we see domestic revenue growing, let's call it 4% this year. You guys chose to grow your capacity, let's call it 5%. From our perspective, we'd say that's going to be dilutive growth. So why was not capacity part of that discussion of what you can control, and is that something you are looking towards in 2018, to maybe rethink it?","Oscar Munoz","It's not. We have dug ourselves in a hole, from a competitive perspective, and the team that we got in together here, is about regaining that competitive advantage, and we have that focus on margin, but at the end of the day, we feel that the moves we made in the marketplace are creating a more positive potential for revenue increases in the future. And so it is a focus of ours and it's one that we are committed to.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Analyst and Investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions]. From Bloomberg, we have Michael Sasso. Please go ahead.","Michael Sasso","Hey, good morning. I will open and this is up to whoever wants to take it. I have been interested in the Polaris international cabin. There has been a lot of blog posts in the last few weeks, suggesting that you are delayed in your lounges. At least, there was some delay early on with seats. It has been really hard from my perspective to kind of assess how it's doing. I have not seen much guidance or input into whether it's helping you win over customers on these international routes. Can you just talk about one, how is it -- one, did you maybe announce this too early, there is some sense that maybe people are confused, why can't they see it? Should you have been a little -- been more restrictive or whatever in how you went about announcing this? And number two, just give us a sense, how is it doing? Is it winning over any customers?","Andrew Nocella","Sure, this is Andrew Nocella. The way I'd describe it is, first of all, whenever you change out -- see employers, there are many -- owner\/suppliers that sees one of the -- for an airline the size of United, it takes a number of years. So the airline announced the new seat and has launched it, and by all of our measurements, where we are flying, it's doing very well. We are serving our customers all the time about the time about the cabin, comfort, their overall experience and all those things are going really well onboard our 777-300s and we just got our first 767 out there. We'd like it to go much faster, and we are looking at ways to do that all the time. But when there is hundreds of aircraft involved, it's just going to take a few years to roll out, and we are well on our way, at this point.","But we also remember, there is many other components to Polaris. There is a new refined food offering, there is new amenities, blankets, and all of those things are available on all United Intercontinental flights, and are being well received by our customers. So we are well along the way. We'd like to go faster. But the feedback we have gotten in two days, I think has been fantastic, about the seat we have put on board and the changes we have made, and you will look for more and more of it over time, as we get more aircraft converted to include the seat, as well as all the other Polaris experiences.","Michael Sasso","And then, is there any -- how would we know, how it's doing? I mean, I guess it wouldn't be broken, I am sure it would be broken out and the results or whatever. But is there -- how could observers tell how it's doing financially, and if it's helping you financially?","Andrew Nocella","Yeah. We wouldn't release that type of individual data. And you are talking about, at this point, a small number of flights across the global system, it would be hard to -- even internally for United to estimate how one or two routes are doing, relative to the whole system. So that's something we wouldn't release. But look, we serve our customers all the time, and we are trying to understand what they like about the service, and we have made incredible headway. And our performance on those aircraft that have the Polaris seat as well as the overall Polaris experience is better than the experience on an aircraft that don't. So we know we are moving in the right direction.","Operator","From The Street, we have Ted Reed. Please go ahead.","Ted Reed","Thank you. I'd like to ask Scott a couple of questions about the ultra low cost carriers. Mainly, in the current quarter, are they doing anything different or are you going to do stuff differently? And also, I'd just like you to explain to me a little bit, the impact on connecting traffic?","Scott Kirby","So not much has changed in the last six to eight weeks in the ultra low cost carriers, and I don't know if things will change going forward. The impact on connecting traffic is, if we are flying between Chicago and Fort Lauderdale, and they are now lower fare. We carry more local traffic between Chicago and Fort Lauderdale. That means, we have fewer seats available to carry from Fort Lauderdale to Des Moines, actually, because we are more likely to be sold out in the local market, because we sold more seats in the local market. So that's how we have changed our yield management posture, with regard to connecting revenues, recognizing that essentially there are fewer seats available for connecting traffic than there were before.","Ted Reed","Thanks. And last thing, what are the hubs where they have the most impact?","Scott Kirby","We have probably the most flights in Chicago, it's number one for us.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you, Scott.","Scott Kirby","Yes.","Julie Stewart","All right. Thank you all for joining the call today. Please contact media relations, if you have any further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Brendon and I'll be your conference facilitator today. Following the initial remarks from management, we will open the lines for questions.","This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed, or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.","I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Jonathan Ireland, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Brendon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com.","Information in yesterday's release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. Number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-Q, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for more thorough description of these factors.","Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor updates, copies of which are available on our website.","Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are President and CEO, Oscar Munoz; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; and Senior Vice President of Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. We also have Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Greg Hart in the room to assist with Q&A.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jonathan. And thank you all for joining us this morning. For the first quarter, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $688 million excluding special items, our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability and our highest first quarter pre-tax profit ever.","We achieved dilutive earnings per share of $1.23 excluding special items, a 28% increase versus last year when adjusting for taxes. And as you all know we repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock.","Reflecting back on the quarter, I'm particularly proud of our operational performance which again showed significant improvement. Our first quarter consolidated on-time performance was more than 12 points better year-over-year and we had 3,600 fewer cancellations, a 20% reduction versus the first quarter of last year. This improvement demonstrates the dedication, passion, and hard work of United's aviation professionals.","I know as I travel the system, I see the renewed engagement, excitement and energy that our nearly 86,000 employees around the world are bringing to work every day. I'd like to thank them for their efforts and dedication, particularly their work through this winter season.","This quarter's results show great strides forward and with our sense of shared purpose and the investments we continue to make in people, processes, and systems, we're positioned for even greater success in the months ahead.","On the commercial side of the business, we launched our Global Performance guarantee, which links our corporate contracts to operational performance, showing both our confidence and commitment to running a consistently reliable operation.","With respect to our network as part of our industry-leading Pacific strategy, we announced an enhanced partnership with Air China, and a joint venture with Air New Zealand, both of which are expected to expand our global reach.","We also announced several routes that further strengthen our global footprint, including the first ever non-stop service by a U.S. carrier to Hangzhou, our sixth Chinese destination. We also became the first U.S. airline to serve Israel non-stop from the West Coast connecting two of the world's most influential technology communities.","Now, having said this, we know we are facing some revenue challenges. We are making good progress on a number of initiatives to improve revenue, but some of them like a more reliable operation and improved customer satisfaction as you know have a lagging effect. I expect these improvements along with other commercial initiatives will drive improved revenue performance as we move into the back half of this year.","Now turning to our people, as I've said many times reaching new agreements with our representative employees is one of my highest priorities. We have already made great progress with our pilots, dispatchers and IAM representative work groups, all ratified contract extensions this year. This represents half of our unionized workforce. We remain focused on getting contracts like these for our flight attendants and technicians and we plan to keep working closely with the unions to make that happen.","Lastly, as you have heard, yesterday we announced additional changes to our board. I want to welcome the two new board members and I look forward to working alongside them and our other recently elected members over the upcoming years.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Jim and Gerry. Jim?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on slide six through the first quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined 7.4%. The four primary drivers we identified at the beginning of the quarter impacted our PRASM performance in line with initial expectations.","In addition, while we had anticipated that the timing of Easter would have some impact on close-in business travel, it proved to be greater than we had expected. While we have seen total bookings return to pre-Easter levels, we are closely monitoring the mix of business and leisure bookings.","Turning to the second quarter: We expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 6.5% to 8.5% year-over-year with domestic PRASM expected to be down approximately 3.5% to 5.5% and international PRASM expected to be down approximately 11% to 13%.","While the primary drivers of this decline are consistent with the first quarter, we are beginning to lapse some of the effects from last year, somewhat muting the impact on a year-over-year basis. For the consolidated system, we expect the strong dollar, lower surcharges, the Houston and energy market weakness and competitive pressures to drive approximately 3.25 points of softness.","While these drivers explain a portion of the unit revenue decline, they don't capture all of it. As can be seen on slide seven, the remaining headwinds unit revenue is largely driven by passenger demand, using GDP as a proxy, not keeping pace with capacity. Like any supply versus demand relationship, this is creating downward pressure on pricing. This is particularly evident in the international markets where United is more exposed than any other U.S. carrier. While United has consistently grown at\/or below the rate of GDP, this dynamic is creating a unit revenue headwind to United of approximately 2.5 points.","Turning to slide eight; we are taking specific actions in each market to improve our unit revenue performance in this environment with a focus on maximizing near-term profitability while also positioning ourselves for longer term success.","In the domestic market, this includes redirecting capacity to capitalize and changing demand patterns, introducing entry level fares to increase segmentation and reduce dilution; launching marketing and sales initiatives that leverage our improving reliability and further rolling out two-cabin service in top business market. We expect that these actions, along with improving reliability and customer satisfaction, will drive domestic unit revenue to be flat to positive in the fourth quarter.","With respect to the international markets, we expect Latin PRASM to turn positive by the fourth quarter, benefiting from reduced Brazil flying. While we are currently experiencing softness in the Atlantic due to recent events, we see strong summer bookings and expect to get close to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter.","Unit revenue recovery in the Pacific will take more time. And surcharges and a strong U.S. Dollar continued to impact our performance. In spite of this, we are very optimistic that the Pacific entity, one of our true competitive differentiators, will see sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement this year despite continued pressure from industry growth, which is not uncommon in developing high opportunity markets like China.","We are also prepared to reduce overall capacity where appropriate. We have made some targeted reductions to our schedule, pulling down flying in Houston, Brazil, and the Middle East. And as you can see on slide nine, we now expect our 2016 capacity to grow 1% to 2%, a half a point reduction from our previous full year of capacity guidance.","In conclusion, during the first quarter, we continued to generate high levels of profitability, despite the unit revenue pressures we experienced across our system. We are taking very deliberate actions within our network and we'll continue to adjust our flying with a goal to maximize long-term profitability and return to positive unit revenues.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gerry.","Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. A summary of our financial performance for the quarter can be seen on slide 11. Our net income declined by approximately $200 million year-over-year as this quarter was the first quarter in a number of years in which we booked significant federal taxes.","Pre-tax earnings improved by approximately $100 million due to lower oil prices, partially offset by lower revenue and higher non-fuel expense. Our pre-tax margin was 8.4%, a meaningful improvement compared to last year. More significantly when adjusted for taxes, our earnings per share of $1.23 increased 28% versus last year.","Details on our fuel expense which decreased by almost $700 million year-over-year are shown on slide 12. This decrease was driven by lower fuel prices, improved fuel efficiency and reduced hedge losses.","Looking forward what we have not added to our hedge book since July of 2015, we're still 12% hedged for the remaining nine months of 2016 and as of yesterday are in a loss position of approximately $80 million including premium expense.","Moving to slide 13, non-fuel unit costs for the quarter grew 1.3% when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third-party expenses. We continue to manage our costs to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the airline.","For the second quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs to grow 2.5% to 3.5%; and for the full year, we now expect unit costs to grow 2% to 3%. This guidance includes the benefit of annual efficiency savings initiatives totaling over $1.1 billion.","These savings initiatives were achieved a full year in advance of our initial expectations and are providing over $100 million more in sustainable savings than our original goal. Our guidance also includes the impact of the three recently ratified labor agreements.","We expect the newly ratified IAM agreement to have a marginal impact on 2016 expenses. For 2017, we expect the impact of the three contracts to be approximately three-quarters of a point of CASM.","Based on the guidance we have provided for cost and revenue, we expect our pre-tax margin to be between 13% and 15% for the second quarter. With respect to cash, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $376 million of free cash flow.","As you can see on slide 14, during the quarter, we invested approximately $820 million in the business. We took delivery of three 787s, two 737s and one used A319. And we added six Embraer E175s to our regional fleet.","We also announced additional aircraft orders for 65 Boeing 737-700 aircrafts. These aircraft will allow us to reduce the size of our 50-seat regional fleet to address the regional pilot shortage while providing customers with larger two-cabin aircraft with greater amenities. Importantly, as we transition out of 50-seat aircraft into the larger gauge mainline aircraft, we expect to begin generating structural cost benefits of up-gauging and reducing departures.","During the quarter, we also announced plans to accelerate deliveries of certain wide body aircraft to facilitate the early retirement of our 747s, as the 747s' cost and complexity to operate continues to be a burden. This decision does not represent an increase to overall CapEx, capacity, or total fleet size.","Our sustained cash generation over the last few quarters and the discounted value of our stock led us to repurchase $1.5 billion worth of stock in the first quarter, representing 8% of shares outstanding.","Based on the progress we've made to-date and cash flow expectations for the rest of the year, we now anticipate completing our $3 billion share repurchase authorization by the end of the third quarter this year.","In conclusion, we showed once again the first quarter solid cost discipline while investing in our business and returning significant cash to shareholders. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our plan to improve our financial performance and secure a strong future for our employees, customers, and shareholders.","I'll now turn it back over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, sir. So while I'm pleased with all of the accomplishments within the quarter, I got to say it's the future that has me and us excited. Thus, after spending time with many of you share owners over the last few months, I know there's a strong desire to learn more about certain initiatives we have underway and of course their impact on the bottom line.","To that end, we'll be holding an investor call on June 21st to describe in more detail many of these initiatives and their contributions to earnings over the next several years. I look forward to that conversation. But before opening up for questions, I'd like to thank our customers for choosing United. They have a choice, and I appreciate your business.","So, with that, I'll turn it over back to Jonathan.","Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Oscar. We will now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to one question; and if needed, one follow-up question. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And please hold for a moment while we assemble our queue. From Barclays, we have David Fintzen online. Please go ahead.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Question on \u2013 really for Oscar. Now that you've gotten a little more time in the seat, can you just talk us through a little bit of how you see the earnings gap to your peers and in large buckets, how do you think about the mix of revenue and cost in sort of closing that gap over time?","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, there's no mistaking that our various airlines domestically are built differently and we clearly have our own strengths and challenges. Our higher cost hubs \u2013 and structurally we are less \u2013 we are a little bit \u2013 little less reliable. But I think of it from the standpoint that we have I believe better business markets and certainly better international gateways. Those are a little bit more competitive than others. But as we think about building a playbook, our own playbook, not copying others, is I think the strategic work that we have to continue to do; and so as I think of your question, I think we have to sort of double down on three areas of strategic focus. Certainly we need to win on revenue. And it's just not markets and schedule and price but it's product and service. Execution, which we're doing a great job already. Reliability certainly; productivity, just heard Gerry talk about that in a significant way. Cost of course is included in that and then technology which we haven't talked about.","We look forward to sharing some of that in June. And people always kind of wink at me when we say this but winning on trust with our employees and then speaking to them and then through to our customers and of course invariably to you as share owners. So we're still in the early innings, the momentum is building in the system across all these areas. But it's a combination of all of those, David.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then when I look at the international RASM outlook, I mean, should we think of those things as just short term oversupply issues or kind of more of the macro or do you think you're going back to sort of the revenue side in closing that gap, I mean, is this something that you think is more structural in nature that's further developing?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey David, this is Jim. The way I think on the international side is clearly depending on the regions of the world, take China, for instance, where passenger demand is growing at a fast pace even in that high capacity. So we believe that over the long-term that capacity and demand will come in line. What we're excited about is our uniqueness as to how we're participating in China.","It's unique in the sense that as Oscar mentioned two new secondary cities in China; that growth that I mentioned out of China, half of that will come from secondary cities. It's the fleet that we have and the flexibility of the 787, it's really allowing us to play in that market at a fairly early stage in a very profitable entity that runs at a high profitability. Quite frankly, at a profitability that's no different than our domestic. So we believe that as demand catches up to the capacity level out there, we will be able to close that year-over-year RASM. And I mentioned in my comments we actually see closing much of that during the year as we move to the fourth quarter.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate that. And I look forward to learning more about the playbook. Thanks.","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi online. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jim, just two questions for you. One just on your \u2013 I'm not sure what you guys want to call it. But the kind of basic economy fare that you guys plan to roll out. Is there any updated timing on when that's going to be launched and is the benefit from that factored into your expectation for flat domestic PRASM by 4Q?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hi, Joseph, we're targeting second half of the year. So no change to our timeline that we talked about and very excited about and yes, it's a piece \u2013 it's one of the initiatives that as I described in my comments of how we're very much focused on moving PRASM to flatten upward and that is a big piece of it.","The concept of it is to allow us to compete more effectively with low cost carriers. And the second piece of it, it will allow us to move some of the dilution that happens in the marketplace given the fare structure we have today. So, yes, absolutely that's part of our path to that flat deposited PRASM in the fourth quarter.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just one for Oscar actually. I think that the CapEx increase that you guys announced surprised some people. Oscar, I'm just wondering if you can you talk about given how short of a time period you have been there, you don't have a permanent CFO in place at this point. What made you feel comfortable to announce such a big increase to your CapEx profile over the next couple of years?","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a combination of things certainly aging of the 47 fleet that needed to be replaced, plain and simple. And on the 37s, it's actually economically viable and accretive rather than not and having to jump on those slots with regards to what was available to us. So, a combination of those things. I can tell you that not only myself, but the team was very deeply involved in that conversation. And we didn't do that lightly knowing what the reaction might be with regards to increased CapEx. Jim, would you add anything?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","And the only thing that I would add is on the 737s, keep in mind, we had a real problem. There is a regional pilot shortage that compelled us to deal with the significant reduction in 50-seat flying. And when we did our analysis to say, okay, what should replace that looking in the new and the used market, we took some used aircraft, as many as made economic sense. In the new aircraft market, we looked at all of the available options. They are all good aircraft, but the lowest cost choice for us is the 737 and 700.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, hello. Oscar, there's a little question that you delivered a pretty unimpressive guide for the second quarter. And I realize that with everything going on with the board, that may have been a distraction and you know you're getting involved with the flight attendant negotiations. Nobody is accusing you of not having a full plate here. But traditionally when companies start falling further and further behind their competitors and based on the guide that is what you expect in the second quarter, they're faced with three choices. You can do nothing. You can simply try harder. Or you can come up with a new plan.","So, my question is simple. Does mediocrity suffice, is fixing United as simple as rolling up your sleeves and relying on easier comps or is something significantly more radical, a change in course ultimately required?","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Is that a leading question, Jamie? I'm going to go with mediocrity for 200 planes. It's \u2013 I think one of the things that is important to know is that we ain't conceding anything on anyone, and so what we've been doing is flying profitably. I have watched and monitored how that works. We need to be, in my mind, a bit more disruptive in the marketplace. I think we've been standing by a little bit too much. Now, exactly what that means and how we do it thoughtfully and from a share owner, sort of value-creating perspective is the work we're beginning to do.","Interestingly enough, I have a couple new board members that have a lot of knowledge and ability in that space. I will lean hard on them with that regard. But, no, it definitely has to change. Accepting the same thing constantly over and over especially in this market. There would be decreasing demand, overall global economic picture, our increase in expenses on the labor side and all those things. We have to do things differently through many, many factors. And so you will see some of that thrust here over the next few months. As far as the initiatives, some of the values of those initiatives will be there. But certainly, again, there is a lagging effect. But, no, there is no one standing by here just waiting for these things to clear up. And hopefully it will get better. We've got to take some action.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That helps. And on that lagging effect, presumably, the investments that you're making in labor aren't driven by a sense of charity. Rather they're intended to generate a return at some point, presumably in the form of better RASM, more corporate share preference by business travelers to make United their first choice and all that kind of stuff. So, in your mind, once labor is embraced, compensated and energized, how long do you think it's likely to take before you start to generate a financial return on those efforts?","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, I'll just correct one thing. I think my family here is damn energized already. So we've got a good hard step on that. How and long it will take, I don't know that I am capable at this point in time with projecting that. The way I'll see it and monitor it and present it very transparent to you \u2013 every little step we take forward, we're going to highlight for you. And how long it's going to take, it's hard to tell. We didn't get here overnight, and we're likely not to get out overnight. But I want to have initiatives that have a more immediate sort of value that you can see. I really believe in this concept of proof, not promises. Again, my history is laden with that, and that's what we're going to work through. So, again, as far as timing, Jamie, it's too early for me to tell you any specific timeframe.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Oscar, thank you for your answers. Take care.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker online. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody, and thank you very much for the time. I know that the first quarter is generally your toughest quarter anyway and you generally underperform your peer group. When you look at the performance in the first quarter to the second quarter, given that the unit revenue guide is kind of flattish to maybe even a little worse, can you just talk about the dynamics that get that revenue decline continued as opposed to sequential improvement?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Helane. This is Jim. You're right. Seasonally, our first quarter is our more difficult quarter. And we are working hard in terms of that sequential RASM to improve that. I do want to emphasize the international exposure. The domestic RASM from the first quarter to the second quarter does, with our guidance, show a sequential improvement. So we are focused very much so on that international side in particular and we've made some capacity adjustments. That's part of our guidance down to 1% to 2% capacity guidance. That half point drop from our previous guidance is all international.","So one is to react to the market out there on the international side, and to make sure that our capacity moves more in line with demand. As we move through, particularly it's still the second quarter, a shoulder period, for instance, in Trans-Atlantic. We see strong bookings in the summertime for Trans-Atlantic that will help with that sequential RASM as we move through the year. We've made initiatives in Latin America that beginning in the second quarter our capacity through the rest of the year is basically flat after doing seasonally adjusted capacities to capture demand in each markets, for instance, that drove our capacity up, very strong margins, but that put pressure on RASM. So our focus is on that international side, the initiatives to move capacity to right places as well as to drive the initiatives.","And in addition, the great work by the operations team and reliability, given that work, we're beginning to see already in our hubs, signs of our share beginning to improve. And we think that will continue and spread and drive that RASM as we go through the year.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks for that very comprehensive answer. I just have a question about the first quarter the decline in regional capacity purchase expense. As you shift more capacity to the mainline from the regionals, shouldn't that expense line actually decline further? And how should we think about the mix between mainline and regional revenue given that your mainline revenue declined more than regional for the first quarter, and maybe it should have been more balanced?","Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer","Helane, let me address the cost piece of it. But clearly as we shift from regional to mainline, you'll see a continual drop in regional expense. Some of that, though, is going to be offset by the increased cost of the regional flying as they have \u2013 the regional airlines have their own pressures that they have to deal with, and that becomes more expensive flying. But generally with the decline of the 50-seat flying, you'll see a drop in regional expense.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Thanks very much for all those answers.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Helane, I will just add to that as we shift to the mainline, remember, it creates revenue opportunity. Those 50-seaters don't have economy, plus they don't have a first-class cabin. And we continue to see great up-sell in the first-class cabin as well as strong economy plus sales.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Jim.","Operator","From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jim, thanks for all the commentary. I appreciate the presentation as well everybody. But, Jim, in your commentary, you talked about being open to adjusting overall capacity. And I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit further. Specifically, I'm just wondering what international entity is driving the biggest sequential revenue deterioration exactly. And I'm wondering what demand trends need to transpire before you might get more aggressive. And however you might talk about that, whether it be bookings or revenues that might be falling short, and how quickly you might be able to respond.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Dan. Thanks for the question. I think the Pacific is quite frankly the biggest sequential driver on unit revenue impact to us. And as I mentioned, we will \u2013 as I mentioned some of the capacity reduction, actually all of that half a point reduction in guidance is on the international. So, we will stay really focused on the demand environment relative to the capacity we have. I will say about the Pacific, it's also impacted but we'll start to lap some of the foreign exchange and the surcharge impact is most dramatic in the Pacific. So, we'll lap some of that.","So, we believe even in that entity that we will continue to close \u2013 move towards flat RASM in the Pacific as we move through the year. The Pacific, as I mentioned, even the markets we're adding, Oscar mentioned two of the secondary cities, but you think of San Fran to Singapore, very unique and innovative for us. It's the first non-stop market to the U.S. just from Singapore.","San Fran-Auckland building on our relationship and growing our relationship with Air New Zealand. San Fran-Tel Aviv that we launched on March 30 is off to a great start, connecting two high-tech communities and seeing great bookings there. So, all of those would say that uniqueness of our expansion we think serves us well and comes at a high level of profitability. All that being said, we've been consistent. We'll keep track of capacity and demand and make sure that we're keeping them in line, but also remembering that the international is also a longer term play that we're really excited about.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Very good. I appreciate that, Jim. I guess just staying on the Pacific for a second here. United did sign a multi-year agreement to strengthen its partnership with Air China per the release. I'm just wondering what is that exactly and how and when might that tie to, say, increased revenue contribution on that entity?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Yeah, Dan, we recently signed an enhanced agreement with them that quite frankly builds a relationship over a longer number of years. I want to be clear; it's based in the concept of the alliance world. It's not a JV world. China is not Open Skies and so it doesn't come with antitrust immunity. But we think we have a lot of ability to grow together both relationship-wise as we learn about the market from each other, both Air China learning about the U.S. market and us quite frankly learning a lot about the Chinese market.","That will bring us closer together in marketing. It will bring us closer together in some sales initiatives and allows us to understand the marketplace. And we think that will enhance our connections through the market as we build not only in Beijing, but as we build in some of the secondary cities. So, we can increase the connecting opportunities that we have with Air China. We connect close to 200 a day over the Air China network in Beijing today. And we think there's upside building that relationship.","So, it's \u2013 within the alliance world, we're bringing much more higher level executive attention to it. The team of senior executives will much more frequently meet with senior executives of Air China to work on those initiatives that I talked about.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Very good. Thanks for the time, guys.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay online. Please go ahead.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning. So, when we talk about the structural margin gap, I think everybody just talks about market share and hubs. And I think that's important, but I think it gets focused on a little bit too much. So, how much of the gap is attributable to the fact that you've a 1,500 mile stage length versus about 1,000 mile stage length for your two biggest peers. And that seems to me like it's as structural as anything. And given that or a change in that wouldn't it just be unreasonable to assume that you have any possibility of closing the margin gap, particularly now that your costs are going to be going higher? And shouldn't we just expect this margin gap to be permanently structural if for no other reason than the stage length alone?","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Hunter, it's Oscar. I'm going to let Jim answer the stage length question specifically as we have discussed it. I'm not sure we'll give you some additional facts there to warrant maybe a different opinion.","With regards to, again, the concept of the long-term perspective and in fact, conceding that margin gap will be there forever as I've studied the market and the industry over the last decade and before, I know that things can change very quickly in one way or another. So, I'm not quite ready to concede anything in that regard. And we'll continue to work the initiatives to close and narrow that margin gap in the near term. But with regard to the stage length, Jim, why don't you cover some of that with him?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Thanks, Oscar. Hey, Hunter, there are structural differences between networks, and I think of them as mainly driven by geography. We clearly have two East-West Coast hubs. That by definition is going to indicate longer stage length. It's also those coastal hubs are tremendous international gateways, which is why our network is really built for strong international presence and growth over time and then international flying.","Our hubs are also very business-centric markets and \u2013 which also means there's lots of competition. And I think you're referring to sea chair and so forth. That's a result of those competitions of large business-centric markets. We don't have a dominant hub. They're very competitive. And, again, the geography of the coastal hubs, large business-centric markets drives more competition. And by definition, drives more stage length.","So we haven't evidence that correlates stage length directly to profitability. Stage length is somewhat a result of the geography and the strength of our hubs. And we think that hub structure works for us very well. For instance, in New York, it is the only true connecting hub in New York. And it allows \u2013 it allows us to make revenue management decisions on high yield flow traffic versus low yield connect traffic that's unique to us. All of those things will drive an actual stage length.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think I will add to that real quickly. As we begin the discussion on this in earnest, certainly that's one area. But there are a lot of other factors that will, in fact, affect our network. And to optimize that network, that's the discussions we are having in earnest with regards to moving forward. So many factors there. Thank you.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Yeah, thank you very much. And look, I appreciate the commentary and the 4Q PRASM trajectory. The market doesn't appear to believe you. Your stock has actually sold off more since you guys provided that. So I think it has been sort of one step forward and one step back with United for the last four years. And as you talk about this margin gap closure, it becomes like all people are going to focus on. So \u2013 and it's actually the fact it's the widening as your operational metrics are improving is arguably even more concerning.","So the existence \u2013 the argument against the existence of a structural disadvantage seems more feeble as time goes on. So is there a conclusion that you might draw here, if that doesn't happen that you don't close the margin gap or the PRASM gap that maybe there is a conclusion that United is just too big?","And is there a scenario where a couple years down the road if you are not getting where you need to be that we're talking about major surgery here to the network, involving asset divestitures or real estate divestitures of something like that, is there a scenario where we see structural overhaul of the network evolving shrinking the size of this company?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Yeah, Hunter, I think it's way too early for anyone, particularly me, to answer that question. And so stand by. I understand your viewpoint, I understand the market's reaction. I understand the situation we're in. And that's what I'm here to do. And that's what we'll get at very quickly.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thank you for the time.","Operator","From Credit Suisse, we have Julie Yates online. Please go ahead.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, in your prepared remarks you noted strong summer bookings, particularly in the Trans-Atlantic and one of your peers last week highlighted strengths in advanced summer yields domestically. Are you seeing similar dynamics on the domestic market?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Julie. You know, as we look at the demand environment in the second quarters, from a business travel point of view, we saw softness in margin that continued into April. We do see signs kind of mid-May and into June, positive signs that would point to strengthening in yield as we get up closer to that time. It's a little bit early on the business traffic, the window. But we are yield there right now.","We feel pretty good that we see some demand picking up as we move towards the summer, beginning in mid-May. I would emphasize corporate is still a little bit soft. We saw our corporate portfolio in the first quarter down 3%. We took out energy, it's down about 2%.","So, the energy sector is impacting us. We expect that to continue through the second quarter, given where oil prices are. So, the corporate sector \u2013 the energy sector as well as the overall Houston hub will continue to put pressure on us. So we see good demand, we see strong demand, but quite frankly it's at lower yields.","And then I think, I'll point to the slide I showed in the presentation and we do have some supply and demand dynamics affecting in diluting yields, as we think about the near-term. And I'll close it that we see demand picking up kind of mid-May, June with some signs of stronger yields.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then is there any additional color you can offer on the Trans-Atlantic and the dynamics causing the weakness there, the sequential deterioration in PRASM in Q1 was a little worse than I would have expected given the actions just taken on seasonal shaping. Is there lingering impact of Paris and Brussels that's going to impact Q2 as well or what are some of the dynamics there?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Yeah, Julie, I think the recent events and the tragedy in Brussels has impacted bookings. What we generally see is a slowdown in bookings after events like that. Those begin to pick back up, but quite frankly you lose days, even weeks of the booking curve.","And that's impacting the second quarter, which is why, in the Trans-Atlantic as you move towards the summer period, that booking curve still has plenty of time to fill up and we see that demand. So, I tie it more to the recent events that, particularly in Brussels, that is affecting the overall travel to the Trans-Atlantic.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg online. Please go ahead.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just two questions here. Jim, going back to the slides \u2013 and by the way, thanks. I really appreciate the slides. Very helpful with the call. But on the slide, I think it's slide eight where you look at the different geographic regions and you call out China performing better than domestic. Now, is that on a PRASM basis or is that on a profitability basis?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Mike, this is Jim. It's on profitability analysis. You can thank my boss for the slides.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then \u2013 thanks, Oscar. And then my second question is to Gerry. With respect to the fleet, when we look at your fleet and how it has evolved, it looks like versus the last update, there is a larger reduction in the number of CRJ-700s.","And as I think about it, I would have maybe anticipated the bigger decline in 50-seaters rather than 70-seaters. And I'm just curious if that reduction is a function of the fact that you're bringing in a lot of E175s, the Embraer Aircraft and maybe that you're up against scope and so as E175s come in, you got to take out CRJ-700s. So, if you could just provide an explanation for that, that would be great. Thank you.","Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer","It's a combination, I think, of two things. One, as you said, the scope limitation that we dictate some of the swapping out of the CRJs for the E175s. And also timing on when the 50-seat aircraft leases expire. We try not to take an aircraft that we're still paying for. So, between the two, that would drive what you're seeing.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. Jim, I wonder, you gave a lot of stats there pretty quickly. I wonder if you could just repeat by regional entity where you think we'll be in the fourth quarter and what gets us there?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Duane. Yeah. This is Jim. As I said on domestic, we expect given our initiatives improved reliability. We're seeing that translate into some of the highest customer \u2013 the highest customer satisfaction scores that we've seen. And as we build on that momentum, coupled with the initiatives, I talked about entry level fare initiatives that comes in the second half of the month.","The ability to upsell into first class as we put more two-cabin aircraft into the domestic system. And other marketing initiatives that will leverage that reliability that we're seeing in our system. We think those initiatives put us on a path to flat to positive PRASM in the consolidated domestic system in the fourth quarter. In the Latin, we also believe we have a path to progression to hit the Latin America PRASM by the fourth quarter as well as in the Trans-Atlantic.","The one area that will probably lag it because of things that are particularly the strong dollar, the RMB, the Chinese currency, is relative \u2013 the dollar relative strength to that currency has a longer tail to it, lack of better words, than what we saw with the yen and the euro.","So, we think Pacific will take a little bit longer to get to flat PRASM by the fourth quarter. But we're really excited about it. And we have a good path to it. We understand the importance of PRASM. And what it means to drive in top line revenue and the team is very much focused on it.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","So, flat to positive in domestic, Atlantic and Latin, which just feels like given the relative size of those feels like a consolidated flat to positive despite Pacific, is that a reasonable way to think about it?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","I put it kind of consolidated closer to flat. Again, the domestic we think we have a path from flat to positive. The other international entities, given the capacity growth were closer to flat, so you weight those together. I would want to call it consolidated positive at this point.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then just for my second question, as we think about losing a bunch of these 50-seaters, can you give us some basic building blocks? So, maybe a ratio for every three 50-seaters that goes away, you take one of these mainline deliveries associated with that order. And then just the inputs to profit improvement to help us sort of build up to what this fleet transition could mean for you over the next couple of years?","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'll jump in and then let Jerry. As you think about from a network perspective, you can think of \u2013 you're right, the three-ish 50-seaters, two to three kind of in line with each of those 737s that come in to replace those.","And so, we think of concepts in markets, where we're perceived neutral and where we can work with frequency and use that mainline aircraft to fill in the pattern that previously had much more higher frequency of 50-seaters. Well, you can kind of think of that two to three range in terms of that replacement.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","And can you give us any sense for profit improvement for each of these that goes away?","Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer","We haven't. But I really want to stress the ability to drive ancillary revenue. On the firsthand, given the economy plus section that comes with that. It's a great first-class cabin. It comes with Wi-Fi. It comes with our personal device entertainment system. So, it has a lot of the attributes that customers are looking for. And it will come with increased reliability.","So, we think from a customer point of view, it will drive great benefit. I think it's one of the things that Oscar mentioned on our Investor Call in June, we can highlight and kind of walk you through some specific steps on that.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just on the cost side, I would add clearly the larger aircraft is going to be more efficient on a seat cost basis and fuel efficiency as well. There will be some meaningful savings there.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi online. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. With regard to the changes that we're seeing at New York in the regulatory changes at New York, do you have a sense of just how much, if any, additional capacity may be accommodated not necessarily your own, but your total New York capacity as a result of the FAA relaxing some of the restrictions there?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hi, Darryl, this is Jim. We don't. And, you know, the marketplace will obviously \u2013 will determine that. Again, our big concern in a highly congested, most congested air space is we \u2013 is the risk of a more congested air space. And so, what that would mean for our customers. In terms of what the market dynamics or what the results \u2013 we just don't have a sense of that right now.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe to follow-on some of the other questions that we've heard. I guess, what might help is if you could give us some reassurance, perhaps, in the level of commitment to actually getting to a positive unit revenue trajectory. Meaning, I've heard some people ask you if you should get smaller, and I think that's a fair question.","And I've heard some people ask you, how confident really are you that you can get to a flat or modestly positive RASM trajectory in some of these markets by the end of the year. But just wondering, you have the ability to get to positive unit revenue in just about any demand environment. It just depends how small you're willing to get. So, would you be willing to provide a commitment to \u2013 the investment community to achieve a flat unit revenue trajectory by the end of the year?","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Oscar. I think, as far as future guidance, I just \u2013 I want to hold my powder dry a little bit until I understand it a little more thoroughly and get a lot of input from all of you as well as our team here. I think on the June call, I think, we'll be able to give you a sense. I know that's a couple months, and it gives us a little more certainty about the year.","But what I don't want to do is begin to commit on these calls the things that I know the market wants. I know the optics wants to be there. We need to fly profitability. We need to fly the way we at United fly with our current network.","And over some point in time, if that needs to change or adjust accordingly, we'd make those changes. But we'll make them thoughtfully with a lot and lot of research and internal analysis. And those are not sort of shooting from the hip kind of conversations that I want to have on a call. So, if you'll allow me a little more patience, now that we're getting back to work, we'll talk a little bit more about this in June. Thanks.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Stephens, we have Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. When it comes to rolling out that basic economy fare later on this year, what are the gating factors that would prevent you guys from getting that out as expected? Sort of what needs to happen internally, is it IT or something else?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Jack. This is Jim. We're really confident on our timeline. The IT team here is very focused. It's a very collaborative process. Quite frankly, it's collaborative with our operations team, because we want to make sure that across the enterprise, the understanding of what the customer is purchasing and what their expectations are for that product are really clear. So, we're really confident on the timeline, and I don't see any gates or as you mentioned in our way. There is a huge collaboration going on, and IT is right behind us with it.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's great. And then when it comes to thinking about fuel hedging, could you guys give us an update on your thought process around, perhaps, increasing your forward hedging, given the volatility to the upside that we've been seeing in fuel over the last several months?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Sure. Hedging is just one tool that can help provide better certainty, as we try to achieve our business plan. It's no longer for us a hedging of near-term volatility. That's a very expensive insurance policy. We can just self-insure that risk. So, it's just one tool. There are a number of factors that we'll look at, including our net exposure to fuel. One of the benefits of the Houston hub works in the other way.","As fuel prices rise, there's a correlation on revenue, particularly in Houston. So, it will be that net exposure that we would focus on. The competitive landscape, what others are doing that could impact the industry and the overall economic environment.","So, we'll be thoughtful about our hedging. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have not done any hedging since last summer. And while there's been some volatility in fuel recently, from a historical perspective, it's still a very low fuel environment.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you again for the time.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth online. Please go ahead.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Just on the CapEx program, could you just talk a little bit about your thoughts on financing. I know that you mentioned about maybe 50% of aircrafts were debt financed this year. But as you look forward, thoughts on operating leases or debt financing and how should we think about liquidity and debt targets?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Sure, Savi. Let me talk about leasing first. I would absolutely love to lease some of these aircraft. But it's got to make economic sense. There are a number of factors, let me give you three. One is just the cost of money, cost of debt.","As you know, we can finance \u2013 debt finance aircraft at a very low cost. That creates a high hurdle for the leasing companies to overcome. And historically they haven't been able to do that. They are better able to today to pass through their lower cost of funds to us. But that's one factor.","Probably the bigger one is residual value. You need to make leasing work in situation where the leasing company is going to be more optimistic on residual value than we are. And then sort of tenure, think of it like buying an automobile. If you're going to trade in your automobile every two years or three years, leasing might make sense. If you're going to keep that auto through its useful life, leasing becomes very expensive.","So, when we look at these aircraft \u2013 these are largely core aircraft that we expect to keep, very long-term, 25 years, 30 years and leasing can get expensive. But, that's not to say that leasing can't work. And like we've done historically, we will continue to look at leasing opportunities and see if we can make anything work in that space.","But that's one of the reasons why when we talk about free cash flow and capital allocation, I look at adjusted free cash flow. So, for me, I'm going to adjust for the financing. So, whether it's a lease or whether we use [ETCs] or other debt financing, that's going to drive the availability of liquidity that we can use in our capital allocation program, where top priority is still going to be returning cash to shareholders. And as we continue to have strong earnings, we would continue with that program.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's very helpful color. Thank you. And for a follow-up, just on the reliability, that has been a big focus and there will be a lot of investments here made to kind of continue to improve reliability. Could you discuss like what metrics you're looking to measure how you're performing on that? And then just from a timing perspective, when do you expect that to kind of manifest itself and get revenue and costs as a benefit?","Gregory L. Hart - Chief Operations Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey. This is Greg, Savi. I'll take the first piece and then defer it to Jim and Gerry on the cost and revenue piece. We look at a ton of factors and a ton of measurements in terms of how we're performing, everything from bag delivery and performance to two different ways of looking at around departure performance to how quickly we shut doors on aircraft and literally tens and tens of metrics each and every day.","And we've managed this quarter through the hard work of the United team and the 86,000 people out in the field working the flights each and every day to actually set record performance across many, many metrics. And as proud of that performance as we are, we're more excited about where we're headed, because we feel we still have a lot of opportunity to improve from there.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","This is Jim. I would just add that reliability that we're seeing and the great progress in that area, we actually are seeing in our hubs our share growing and taking hold the beginnings of that. And when I talk about moving towards flat deposit RASM by the fourth quarter domestic, again a piece of that is the momentum that we're capturing there.","So, it's hard to put a timeline on net revenue as Oscar referred to that earlier. But we're seeing signs in our hubs in that share. We want to obviously expand that some of those old cities and get some traction there. But we're really confident with the reliability and the initiatives we have out there. That's part of our success in moving towards flat to positive.","Gerald Laderman - Senior Vice President Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And from the cost side, we're seeing some of that benefit already. You think about misconnects and having to deal with the cost of putting customers up at hotels and meals and whatnot and crew costs as well. So all of that, we see immediately as we run more reliable operations, but there's still more to come on that as we can gain greater efficiency in the operations. So, while we have some cost savings, we're already seeing it will increase over time.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Savi. This is Oscar. One thing, at least from my operational background that I think applies across any industry, as you invest to become more reliable, that investment is purely a cost one. As you get more reliable, how you reduce that cost or that safety cushion, how quickly you do it, how effectively you do it, is a key attribute that Mr. Hart will be challenged with very quickly.","And, again, now, every time we do that, I mean, we've said Denver and Houston over the last couple of weeks have been massively hit. We have 700 people that are not able to come to work on a day. And so it's all those things and all of those different moving parts that you have to address. But that safety cushion is across the system will have to be managed better. And then, therefore, cost comes out. But it starts with having a reliable product. So, thank you.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Savi.","Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations","And thanks to all of you for joining the call today.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mike Leskinen, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Leskinen","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone and welcome to United's Third Quarter of 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com.","Information in yesterday's release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the Company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, investor update and presentation, copies of which are available on our website.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart; Executive Vice President of Technology and Chief Digital Officer, Linda Jojo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. In addition, we have other members of the team in the room available to assist with Q&A.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Mike and my thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before I start, as we always do, we want to thank each and every one of our United colleagues for their determination and passion for serving our customers. It truly is their dedication that has helped us build the track record of delivering on our financial targets and returning a solid value to our investors that we have.","So to the results, we had another strong quarter of results. As you can see on Slide 4, we reported adjusted pretax earnings of $1.4 billion with an adjusted pretax margin of 12.1%. Our adjusted earnings per share of $4.07 was 33% higher than the third quarter of last year and that reflects 250 basis points of adjusted pretax margin expansion in the third quarter. It is our best so far this year.","It also reflects the third consecutive quarter that our pre-tax margin has grown in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis. This strong performance gives us the confidence to raise our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $11.25 to $12.25.","We are now ahead of pace towards achieving our 2020 adjusted EPS target of $11 to $13 which we set nearly two years ago. We extended this quarterly streak of pretax margin expansion despite the obstacles like historically severe weather, volatile global market and of course the grounding of the MAX aircrafts. Now we didn't overcome these obstacles by cutting back on the value we provide to you, our customers, in fact, just the opposite.","We continue to invest in a variety of improvements to the United experience that are benefiting our customers and elevating the value proposition of flying United. Here's just a few items. Our ConnectionSaver, which you've heard about that's already saved over 50,000 customers from missing their connections year-to-date, which is accruing customer gratitude and appreciation over time while ensuring each aircraft arrives on time.","We are also now selling flights on the new CR J550 which will transform regional flying and give us a uniquely United advantage serving customers in our [small city] [ph] as they connect to international destinations. As we told you before, it will offer a first-class cabin, economy plus seating, Wi-Fi and more amenities than any other 50-seat regional aircraft operating today.","So from the award winning and refreshed United app to expanded complementary snack options, we are continuing to invest in our customers' experience across the board. But ultimately, what makes all of those enhancements truly come alive are the people who deliver them and serve our customers every day and that is why our Backstage event for our flight attendants are so pivotal. It's proven to be an absolutely game changing experience for our employees.","I believe the reason for their enthusiastic response is that Backstage brings our core4 principles to life in a variety of tangible ways that authentically resonate with our employees and our customers. It's been really satisfying to travel systems since we introduce core4 and witness how our employees have embraced this framework of safe, caring, dependable and efficient. And it's inspiring to see how they've taken personal ownership of the concept finding creative compelling ways to embody it, every customer, every flight, every day.","In closing, when you look at the sum of all these efforts, what you see is a picture of what proof not promise looks like in practice. So we have less than a quarter left of 2019 and we believe our momentum remains strong. But I promise you and I use that word with earned confidence, we expect the best lies ahead.","I look forward to welcoming journalists from around the world for our first ever Media Day here in Chicago on October 24 and October 25. It will be an excellent opportunity to showcase what is driving our confidence and the bright future of United Airlines, and the new spheres of United.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Kirby","Thanks, Oscar. I'd also like to thank all the people of United Airlines for the incredible job they're doing taking care of our customers and producing strong results. Thanks to our team's no excuses mentality, we delivered another quarter of adjusted pretax margin expansion.","This continued an eight quarter streak of coming in above the midpoint of our guidance range. Andrew and Gerry will talk more about the recent results and the near-term future, but I want to address a couple of the bigger picture questions that have been top of mind for our investors.","First, we're getting a lot of questions about our ability to continue driving flat CASM-ex in the years to come. It certainly won't be easy, but our goal remains to drive flat CASM-ex at the same time, we will of course continue to make the anticipated increases in compensation for all of our employees. After all, it's the people of United Airlines that are driving these results and they deserve sharing the rewards.","As Oscar mentioned earlier, we also expect to continue making significant product and customer experience investments next year consistent with our core4 framework of being safe, caring, dependable and efficient. We've been doing that this year with investments like ConnectionSaver, free DirecTV, dramatic improvements to Wi-Fi and much, much more. We already see the positive impact of those investments.","The material increases in customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Scores which is driving customers to choose United Airlines and contributing to our strong financial results. So how can we continue to invest in our people and our customer experience and drive towards flat CASM-ex? For one thing, we plan to take advantage of increasing gauge.","We have large hubs in big cities across the country and because of that we should be the airline with the highest gauge. But at this point, we aren't. In fact, United is seven years to eight years behind our large competitors on gauge growth with approximately 13% fewer seats per domestic departure compared to Delta.","As our fleet mix shifts to a higher percentage of larger gauge mainline aircraft instead of regional aircraft, we begin closing that gap in earnest starting next year, and we're planning for approximately 3% more seats per departure by the end of 2020. We expect gauge growth to continue to the middle of the next decade.","In addition to gauge growth, we've also built a disciplined, action-oriented, innovative no excuses culture here at United, where we make difficult decisions to drive efficiency throughout the Company, which provides us with the resources to continue investing in our people, product, and customer experience.","The second big concern that we're hearing from investors is what's going to happen to industry PRASM with the return of the MAX. We don't have unique insight into the economy that will make our opinion any better than yours. But we're more optimistic than most about industry revenues and more importantly, we feel good about our track record of overcoming hurdles and producing results without making excuses.","We're in the early innings of our journey to make United the best airline in the world for our customers and our employees and our owners. We believe, we'll continue to have uniquely United opportunities that will allow us to continue to differentiate our performance in 2020 and beyond. The bottom line is that we expect to meet or exceed our $11 to $13 adjusted EPS target for next year.","I'd now like to take a moment to talk a little bit about the team and culture here at United. Many of you probably play fantasy football. I don't by the way. And my wife, Kathleen is in a couple of leagues and is actually the Commissioner of one of our league, so I hear about it a lot.","A successful company is a lot like a successful fantasy football team. You're looking for players you can count on who are more than just stand out individual performers. You are looking for talented players, who are part of a good team, playing in a good system and who overcome obstacles to help their team win. And the reason is simple. Football is a team sport. Well running an airline is a team sport also. And here at United, you've got a talented team and a great system that now has a track record of overcoming obstacles and competing at the highest level.","On these earning call, we're increasingly trying to introduce you to more of the talent on our team. Kate Gebo, our EVP of Human Resources and Labor Relations joined the call last quarter, and today, you will hear from both Greg Hart, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer; and Linda Jojo, our EVP of Technology and Chief Digital Officer.","Even better, get out there and fly United, and you'll see in person what our incredible frontline team is doing every day to take care of our customers. This really is a new United Airlines and we're continuing to build a new culture around a talented team that's determined to be the best airline in the world for our customers, employees and owners.","Right now, we're winning and we're more confident than ever about our future. There have been and will be speed bumps along the way. But we will not be defined by them. We will be defined by our ability to overcome them. I'm really proud of this team and really proud to be a part of it.","And with that, I'll turn it over to my talented colleague, Greg.","Greg Hart","Thank you, Scott. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and I also want to thank all of our 95,000 employees. This has been an incredible year and I want to take a moment to mention some of the great achievements of our team. We are consistently number one for on-time departures at all hubs, where we face with large competitor. In the quarter, we achieved first place in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.","In fact, September was the 15th month in a row we've outperformed our three major competitors in LAX, the 31st month in a row in Chicago, we outperformed our two main competitors and the 55th month in a row in Denver that we've outperformed our two major competitors, achieving first place in on-time departures at all of those hubs. And we did this while carrying more customers than ever.","This is really something to be proud of and is a true testament to the team's ability to quickly and effectively respond to the range of operational challenges we face every day while doing their very best to take care of our customers.","Our teams have achieved this incredible track record despite the fact that we are facing some hard hitting weather across the system. Tropical storm Imelda caused severe flooding in Houston and impacted over 20% of our scheduled flight system-wide for three days in September.","We also had 9% of our flights impacted by aircraft control delays in the quarter. This compares to about 4% at our competitors. Tough weather and irregular operations are nothing new to United but it's incredible to see how our team gets better and faster recovering from these events.","To enable this success, we have equipped our employees with the right tools to manage all types of situations. Linda and her team have done an incredible job of putting technology in the hands of our employees to better communicate with each other to solve problems in the operation or take care of customers in the moment. We are running a great operation at United and we couldn't be proud of the team. We are the industry leader when it comes to our ability to recover from irregular operations caused by weather and we'll continue to learn and only get better from here.","I'll now pass the call on to Linda.","Linda Jojo","Thanks, Greg. It's great to be on the call today. I'm excited to share some of the progress we've been quietly making on the digital front, our operational improvements and growth plan takes hold. At its core, we've created a fast-paced, action-oriented culture that frees our people to partner closely with the business units and quickly roll out and test new innovations.","Not all of them work, but the fast pace allows us to quickly test new ideas, discard those that don't and double down where we're seeing cuts. Today, I am going to highlight a few examples of those high return investments. Starting with our digital channels, united.com and our award winning mobile app, we enable our customers to purchase and change both tickets and ancillary products through any of our channels at any time before their trip. All of the confidence that if they change their mind, we have their back.","For example, if a customer can pre-pay for her bag at time of ticket purchase but if she doesn't actually end up checking her bag, the bag fee is automatically refunded. We are the only airline to do this. Or if a customer checks the app, when she arrives at the airport and sees that she might be too far down the upgrade list, she can purchase an upgrade right in the app.","We also continue to build upon personalization of our mobile app. Developments like Mile Play, which is unique to United, our \u2013 our in-app product offers include artificial intelligence, gamification features that increases customer engagements and drive take rates even higher, especially with our millennial customers.","These examples may seem small, but they have helped us grow ancillary revenues by over 18% year-to-date. I want to speak briefly about how we work. Our digital team does not sit in some far off building or city. We are embedded in the airline and rather than take years, new tools and features are rolled out in weeks often at just one airport or one region, where we get real-time feedback, make changes and then repeat it until we get it right.","As you've heard from Andrew in the past, our new revenue management platform Gemini is helping us get more granular and delivers significant value to United to more precise forecasting and predictive modeling. This wasn't a Big Bang implementation but one that started small was modified and expanded until it covered all of our markets.","In the operation, we took this approach when solving the problem of aircraft swaps. We have to take a plane out of service. We have a new tool that consider several possible aircraft, evaluate future scheduled maintenance, the seat layout and many other factors and then makes a real-time recommendation to our routers on which aircraft to fly. This gets our down \u2013 our customers on their way, all while creating the least amount of downstream disruption.","What I\u2019ve touched on today is just a small sample of what we do. We have created tools, developed apps and streamline processes that benefit our customers and our employees while improving revenues and driving cost savings, and there are hundreds of projects we're working on now side by side with Greg and Andrew's teams that we believe will drive customer engagement, empower our financial performance for years to come.","With that, I'll pass it over to Andrew to recap our commercial performance.","Andrew Nocella","Thanks, Linda. In the third quarter, our PRASM grew 1.7% which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, with September being the strongest month in the quarter. PRASM performance in our domestic network was up 2.1% on a 1.7% increase in capacity driven by solid close-in bookings.","International performance was mixed with continued robust results in Latin America offset by headwinds in Asia. Latin America was our best performing international region in the third quarter. Third quarter PRASM increased 7.2% on a 0.4% increase in capacity. We had great results in many parts of Latin America, including double-digit increases in Mexico, Brazil and Puerto Rico.","Performance across the Pacific further weakened in the quarter with a negative 3.4% decrease in PRASM on a 2.3% increase in capacity. All the weakness occurred in Hong Kong and to a lesser extent Beijing and Shanghai. As we indicated earlier in the quarter, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai reduced our Q3 system performance by about 0.5 point.","Atlantic PRASM was up 0.8% in the quarter on a 2.8% increase in capacity, strong U.S. point-of-sale demand offset weaker European point-of-sale demand. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect our consolidated passenger unit revenue to be up 0% to 2%. We see potential for stronger yields among leisure travelers during the holiday season. We think this is a positive indication of the increasing effectiveness of our commercial initiatives and customer focus here at United.","Our PRASM outlook is also impacted by our ability to quickly adjust to changing market conditions as demonstrated in the third quarter. This summer, we announced the suspension of Chicago to Hong Kong and New York to Buenos Aires which were offset with capacity increases to other parts of Latin America. And a global network as large as ours there will clearly always be a few spots that have demand issues.","Hong Kong demand, while weak, has for the moment stabilized. We expect Pacific year-over-year PRASM performance in the fourth quarter to improve versus the third quarter. We continue to push the booking curve closer into departure date saving more seats for a closer-in, higher yield business traveler, which in turn allows stronger yield performance early in the booking curve for leisure customers.","Gemini, our new RM system that Linda mentioned earlier is working well with this strategy. Additionally, our sales team has been busy signing up new corporate accounts totaling over 500 year-to-date, a record number for United so far. This is just one of the many initiatives that we have in place to help us drive our RASM performance in 2020.","We believe United's network is uniquely suited to be the leading airline for business here in the U.S. as well as across the globe with our great partners. Our network is performing well as we continue to build connectivity, scheduled dep and small community service focused on our Mid-Continent hubs.","However, our coastal gateway hubs also saw improved profitability on many network realignments over the past year. We're running a disciplined airline that will make hard decisions like suspending service and as a result, all of our hubs are profitable on a rolling 12 month basis. It's a nice achievement on our road to our adjusted EPS targets.","Turning to Slide 13. We continue to focus on our commercial initiatives. Our first set of 10 dual class CRJ-550s are scheduled into service in the next couple of weeks with client focus here in Chicago, later followed by New York. We expect to have 54 CRJ-550s flying by the fall of 2020.","We announced several changes to the MileagePlus program into the third quarter. First, miles don't expire anymore, which will help engage new members and less frequent travelers in the program. Second, we replaced our upgrade certificates with PlusPoints, which starting in December will be easier to use and understand.","PlusPoints can be managed in our industry-leading mobile app, a first for any U.S. airline. Third, we will adjust how members are in status going forward to be more reflective of their total value. As a reminder, we are also now dynamically pricing award redemptions in Q4 for the first time, which allows, both lower and higher redemption pricing, a win for our customers and our investors.","Segmentation initiatives continue to perform well and we have a lot of them in different phases of roll out. Basic Economy allows us to offer a low price point profitably. Premium Plus will accelerate in 2020 and beyond, be more consistently offered across the globe on our wide-body jets. Our high business class configuration 767s are now operating most flights from London to Chicago and New York. Installation of Polaris seats continues and in 2020, our passengers will find an increasingly consistent experience on our intercontinental fleet of wide-bodies.","We now regularly offer with plans to continue in 2020 Boeing 787-10 service from New York to California and have recently started selling Premium Plus seats on these selective flights. We estimate that our Economy Plus seats per departure on mainline jets is now more than 50% larger than our competitors, providing our frequent flyers with more upgrade opportunities and serving as an excellent driver for ancillary revenue growth.","As we look to next year, we expect these uniquely United initiatives, the CRJ-550 deployed in key high yield markets and the ancillary revenue drivers that Linda spoke about earlier to drive incremental revenue growth moving forward. Thanks to the entire United team for a great third quarter.","With that, I will turn it over to Gerry to discuss our financial results.","Gerry Laderman","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Before I start, I want to mention that one prominent analyst recommended that we have no theatrics on the call this morning. In deference to this analyst, I will attempt to be as bland as possible. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our third quarter 2019 earnings release and our fourth quarter investor update. You can refer to those documents for additional detail.","For the highlights, Slide 15 is a summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 16 shows our non-GAAP adjusted results. We are pleased to report adjusted earnings per share of $4.07 for the third quarter, up 33% versus a year ago. Adjusted pretax income was $1.4 billion and adjusted pretax margin was 12.1%, up 250 basis points year-over-year and marking the fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted pretax margin expansion. These strong results demonstrate our ability to offset challenges across our global network, as we continue to grow margins. Slide 17 shows our total unit cost for the third quarter and our forecast for the fourth quarter and full year 2019.","Turning to Slide 18, nonfuel unit cost in the third quarter increased 2.1% on a year-over-year basis, slightly above our original expectations. This was due to our capacity growth for the quarter coming in at 1.9%, slightly below our original expectations.","As we discussed on the last call, we have some pressure on nonfuel unit costs in the second half of this year due to the timing of a number of maintenance events which moved from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. We expect fourth quarter CASMex to be up year-over-year by approximately 3.5% which brings projected full year 2019 CASMex to be up around 1.2% as compared to last year. Almost all of this year-over-year increase in unit cost compared to our original plan of year-over-year flat or better is driven by the MAX grounding, temporary suspension of our India flights and suspension of our Chicago, Hong Kong flight.","Looking ahead to 2020. We are in the middle of our budget process and we'll provide formal guidance in January. However, based on preliminary numbers, we expect nonfuel unit cost next year to be flat as compared to this year. This will put us slightly above the target we established almost two years ago to maintain flat CASMex during the three year period from 2018 through 2020.","We began making investments in customer experience over the past year and those investments have resulted in improved financial results. We expect to continue to make more investments next year that we believe will enhance margins. While these improvements represent about 1% of CASMex growth overall, we are very proud of the cost control we've delivered and will continue to deliver.","Through next year, we expect the three year compound annual growth rate for nonfuel unit cost to be just 0.3% which would be a remarkable and industry-leading achievement and allow us to deliver our commitment to use to meet or exceed our adjusted EPS targets.","As you can see on Slide 19. During the quarter, we took delivery of six additional used Airbus A319 aircraft and nine new Embraer E175 aircraft. We also spent $363 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the third quarter at an average price of $88.22 per share. This brings our year-to-date repurchases through the third quarter to $1.4 billion.","During the quarter, we raised $1.2 billion of WTC debt at a blended interest rate of about 2.8%, the lowest rate on record for this type of debt and another proof point that the market already views us as an investment grade credit. We maintain a healthy balance sheet that allows us to be opportunistic with share repurchases and strategic investments.","Lastly, Slides 20 and 21 have a summary of our current guidance. The range provided for capacity, revenue and costs implies an expected fourth quarter 2019 adjusted pre-tax margin between 7% and 9%. As Oscar mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be between $11.25 and $12.25. With three quarters behind us, we are proud of our financial performance and ability to nimbly manage the business. Finally, our cost management is an integral part of our path towards continued margin expansion, and our entire team is taking a rigorous approach to our budgeting process to ensure that we offset inflationary pressures next year and achieve our financial targets.","With that Mike will now begin the Q&A.","Mike Leskinen","Thanks, Gerry. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed, one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask the question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And from Bernstein, we have David Vernon. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Andrew, I wanted to follow-up on an issue we talked about before, which is the premium economy roll out. Have you guys gotten any closer to being able to kind of give us a sense for what the unit revenue headwind or tailwind, or tailwind from that is going to be in 2020?","Andrew Nocella","I don't have a 2020 number to report to you. I can tell you in Q3 it was 0.5 point number system. So it's pretty substantial.","David Vernon","So 0.5 point tailwind from the premium economy roll out and that should be a bigger impact next year or smaller impact?","Andrew Nocella","I'm not going to give you that number today. But what I would say is that we are becoming increasingly consistent and Greg's team is rolling out these aircraft very, very quickly. So we expect by next summer, premium economy getting really consistent across the system, so we're pretty bullish about its contribution next year. It's one of the reasons why we think RASM \u2013 the PRASM next year is pretty good.","David Vernon","Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, as you think about the impact of dynamically pricing the award tickets, is that \u2013 can you help us give \u2013 help give us a sense for what that should do from either a utilization or yield benefit kind of as we think about the 2020-2021 timeframe?","Andrew Nocella","What I would tell you is that we're able to kind of move the redemption awards around in a way that allows us to price lower and price higher, which we think will be a net benefit to the airline, but I'm not going to give any more details on that, but we do think this is a win for everybody and that we have a lot more lower-priced inventory available out there based on our ability to be more surgical in the way we price it.","David Vernon","Have you seen any change in the redemption rates on that so far as you're starting to enable it?","Andrew Nocella","No, we are continuing to redeem miles, I think at the same pace. It's going very well.","David Vernon","All right, thanks very much for the time, guys.","Operator","From Credit Suisse, we have Joe Caiado. Please go ahead.","Joe Caiado","Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. First question really on high level 2020 capacity growth outlook. Now I'm not looking for explicit guidance, we have the 4% to 6% guide posts that you've given us, but Scott, since you mentioned that we're going to start to see some gauge growth in the operation next year, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about how we should think about departures and gauge and stage and the overall composition of your growth for next year?","Andrew Nocella","Sure. This is Andrew. We're still developing the plan for next year. So it is still preliminary. That being said, assuming the MAX returns there and we don't know when that will be. And based on the fleet plan we have, we are driving to increase the gauge of the airline. It happens more in the back half of the year than the first half quite a bit, in fact, more in the last 90 days quite frankly.","But as we looked at our load factors where we're flying aircraft and the size of aircraft we have out there, we think this is the next great opportunity. It's going to be a significant help to CASMex as I'm sure Gerry will talk about later. So that's kind of where we're going. But there's still a lot of moving pieces. The plan is not finalized, but we believe there is a ton of opportunity for gauge growth at airline, given our hubs are located in the largest cities across the country, and we're currently flying the smallest gauge as anybody.","Joe Caiado","Okay, got it. And then actually, just another quick follow-up for you Andrew. You mentioned your corporate sales team signed a record 500 new accounts this year, I think that's what you said. Can you just give us a sense for how that breaks down roughly between brand new corporate accounts for United versus customers that may be left United several years ago and now you're winning them back?","Andrew Nocella","There's definitely a mix of those, but quite frankly a lot of these \u2013 the disproportion of share are brand new customers. To be clear, some of these customers flew United without a corporate deal. So we want to be very clear about that, but now they're signed up on a corporate deal where we can provide them the appropriate discounting being a bigger share of their spend. So I think it's a pretty big deal.","Our sales team is doing an excellent job out there, and quite frankly, the product that we're delivering every day is making their job easier and easier. So we can win back customers that maybe left us many, many years ago and we also can gain new customers. So it's just been, can\u2019t say how bullish we are about the progress we've made on the sales front, we believe that a lot of that activity in terms of the revenue creates shows up in 2020 and beyond.","Joe Caiado","I appreciate the answers. I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, good morning guys. First and obvious one on the CASM side for, I guess, Gerry and Scott, does your preliminary CASM thoughts for next year still include a reset of all your open labor contracts?","Gerry Laderman","Yes, it's Gerry . So all of our CASM guidance that we put out, including the original three-year numbers includes something for any open labor contracts.","Rajeev Lalwani","And does that apply for 2020 as well?","Gerry Laderman","It applies pretty much for any CASM guidance we put out, period. So, yes.","Scott Kirby","For any guidance that we put out, we make it a point to put in scenarios for everything, so we're not going to make excuses and this is consistent with our guidance practice of putting anticipated labor increases in the guidance.","Rajeev Lalwani","Understood. It just seemed like things were moving around and I wanted to clarify, so thank you for that. And then, Andrew, a relatively quick one for you. You talked about health and leisure going into the fourth quarter. Can you provide a little bit of color on how corporate's looking, and then maybe some color on domestic versus international?","Andrew Nocella","Sure, trying to take it piece by piece. I would think what we're seeing is corporate volumes are steady, they are not growing rapidly, but they are steady, but even more importantly than that, we're seeing leisure yields as we enter the quarter being pretty strong. So that gives us a lot of confidence about our outlook as we go into the quarter.","So for example, the premium cabins were slightly down across the Atlantic and across Pacific in the previous quarter and that's probably true in the next quarter. But the main cabin is outperforming that. And so we're pretty pleased by that performance and that's driven again by leisure travelers or main cabin travelers more than business travelers.","In terms of view of the world, international had tough comps in the Q3 time period. As we go into Q4, I expect international is likely to outperform domestic on year-over-year PRASM increases. As I said earlier, I expect the Pacific to do better in Q4 than it did in Q3. It's interesting, I would always say that I've never seen a bigger disconnect between the global headlines in terms of the economy and its potential impact on travel than the numbers I see here at United for yields and future RASM builds across the globe. Latin America looks \u2013 continuing to look very strong, Europe is definitely going to be probably the weakest of the three, but also still doing I think very well from a P&L perspective. So overall, I couldn't be more happy about where we stand and the outlook for Q4 I think looks really solid.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning, everybody. First question for Gerry. How do we think about CASM relief as the MAX is reintroduced? Obviously in above plan growth rate next year provides its own relief, but specific to the MAX and the cost drag that it's currently creating, how sticky are those costs? How quickly do they exit as the aircraft is reintroduced? And also for any one-time maintenance costs and I understand it's going to differ whether the planes have been in short-term or long-term storage, do you intend to take those as one-offs or is that also baked into the CASM guide?","Gerry Laderman","So, yes, our plan for the MAXs next year is actually similar to what we were planning this year. The issue is going to be, Jamie, if, let's say there are further delays next year than what we are currently assuming, that could create again CASM pressure like it did this year, but other than that, for us, it's sort of business as usual and baked into that CASM, I wouldn't call it a guiding tip, but the CASM expectation that I mentioned earlier.","Greg Hart","And this is Greg, the maintenance cost associated \u2013","Jamie Baker","Hi Greg.","Greg Hart","\u2013 aircraft back in the service is minimal, not material at all.","Jamie Baker","Okay, perfect. And second question probably for Scott or for Andrew, how have your multi-year forecasts for Latin America changed in the last month or so? Obviously, material revision in terms of alliance structure down there, I realize you're pursuing your own strategy with several partners. We also have American adding capacity with its own metal. I know you don't guide by geography, but have you made any internal revisions to your forecast as to how you're thinking about Latin America on a multi-year basis? ","Scott Kirby","We have not, I will tell you that I think our recent performance has actually gotten better, given all the changes with revision, which is I think fascinating, it is doing incredibly well. As you can see by the numbers we\u2019ve put up this quarter and last quarter. So we're pretty happy by it, it's not our biggest international entity and therefore we have been working really hard with a great set of partners, Copa, Avianca and Azul, and we are going to put together a fantastic joint business and we are going to be competitive in the region as a group in a way that I think has actually just been enhanced over the last few weeks. So we're pretty pleased by where we stand and are positioned in for the long-term.","Jamie Baker","Okay, thanks for the color. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","From Vertical Research Partners, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, good morning everyone, thanks for the time. Scott, I don't want to downplay the CASMex performance, that's clearly industry leading. But I do \u2013 I would like if you're able to get a little bit better feel for the investments that you're talking about, in particular, I guess your operational reliability has become much better, the customer experience is better as you've outlined, Linda's team has clearly made some investments. Is there a way to tie all of that back to your expected RASM performance relative to the industry?","Andrew Nocella","Maybe I'll try \u2013 it's Andrew, I'll give you maybe one or two examples. So we announced, I think six months or nine months ago the High-J 767 that would be flying across the Atlantic. When we did that, we took a bunch of seats out the aircraft and we caused the CASM of that aircraft flying from New York to London to go up by about 25% quite frankly.","And so as we give our guidance for next year, part of that guidance includes a significant CASM headwind related to the reconfiguration of those aircraft, but we reconfigured those aircraft to get higher RASM and in fact our performance as we look forward is going to be well in excess of the increase in CASM, otherwise, we would not have done it. And so I think that's working well. But when you add that up, you have to think about the fact that our CASM is definitely higher on that aircraft. And as a result, it's going to drive higher RASM and it's one of the reasons we think, we are going to have decent RASM results for next year.","The CRJ-550 is not all that dissimilar, we now have our premium cabin being offered to all flights that we didn't have before. We know our CASM of that particular aircraft is going to be up high single digits relative to what otherwise could be, but we think the RASM gains related to that is more than that. So those are just two, I think really very specific examples of us pushing higher costs on to the airline in terms of CASMex, but knowing we're going to get it back in terms of RASM and knowing we are managing our total CASMex number to a really great spot. So those are just two examples.","Linda Jojo","Yes, I can, this is Linda. I can add one really about improving onboard Wi-Fi. Greg's team in tech-ops have just done an incredible job to make the product more stable. We have 63% less maintenance deferrals, 20% less onboard recess by our in-flight crew. And what that's translating into is customers that are just using it more. You have 30% increase in our data consumption and 17% increase in customer satisfaction.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. I'll keep it to one, thank you.","Oscar Munoz","Hi Darryl. Let me just add. I have been long enough to see where there were times we managed for revenue. There are times we managed for cost and as you know those never worked and what you're hearing everybody say is all this is managing to margins and EPS. So those investments that we're making are going to drive those financial results.","Darryl Genovesi","Perfect. Thanks very much everyone.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hi good morning. Hi, Scott, you guys are clearly driving some transformational changes with the way you do business and your success is obviously involving some pretty big thinking, so with that backdrop, Scott, what is the likelihood that you push for and get partial content agreements with GDS in your next negotiation and if that's not a near-term issue. How important to that \u2013 how important is that to you that you eventually get there?","Scott Kirby","Look. We are quite proud of the culture that we're, that we we're creating here at United and you're right that there is transformational changes going on. We\u2019ve talked about some of the big picture items, the reason I talked about the team and the culture on some of these calls recently is because, I literally could talk for the next hour off the top of my head on examples of things that are going on throughout the airline that no one else is doing and that the team of people at United Airlines is doing and doing quickly and it's showing up in our bottom line results.","As to the GDS specifics, it kind of depends on where those partners are and what they want to do. We want to be able to deliver our products to our customers who are actually willing to carry a fair price to do that. We want to be able to deliver our product to our customers in the way they wanted to consume it and purchase it as long as we can do so at a fair price and importantly as long as GDSs or OTAs or anyone else can actually display the products to the customer.","And so any push back that we have in the months, quarters, years to come with third-party providers is more likely to be about their ability to service the customers in a way that we think is appropriate.","Hunter Keay","All right. And then on CASMex the third-party expense was up over 100% year-on-year in 4Q, the guide. Why didn\u2019t other revenue tracking higher? And is $65 million a quarter a good run rate to use as we model that out for 2020?","Gerry Laderman","It's Gerry. So what happened with other revenue is, what you are also seeing there is the impact of the decline in cargo, which offset what you would have seen as a gain in third-party maintenance revenue.","Hunter Keay","Right. And then the run rate into 2020, Gerry if you would \u2013 should we take $65 million a quarter in third party-expense and put it into that run rate for 2020, third-party expense.","Gerry Laderman","Yes, it's a good number to use.","Hunter Keay","Okay, Gerry. Thank you.","Operator","From Cowen, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks, operator. Hi team. Thank you very much for the time this morning. So I'm not sure whether it's Scott or Oscar to answer this question, but, or maybe even Greg. Last week, I think you said, you were going to hire 10,000 pilots over the next decade, which seems right when we look at your numbers, we see about 6,500 of about 12,000, 13,000 maybe retiring in that time frame. So can \u2013 so it works out to like a 1,000 a year. Right? Can you say what percent of those hires are going to be growth versus retirees?","Scott Kirby","Helane, that's a difficult question to answer, right now, because a lot depends on where we're flying obviously if we're flying long-haul flights. We got augmented crews which drive a little bit more need for pilots, but the majority. The vast majority of those hires will be replacing retirements with our wave starting to hit us in 2022 or 2023.","So that's kind of what we're looking at is the vast majority of the 10,000 will be replacing folks currently on our seniority list.","Helane Becker","Okay. Well, so then as you up gauge. Just as a follow-up. As you up gauge the aircraft, is it more, do you need more pilots per plane or I guess the other part of it is the training costs associated with moving pilots around.","Gerry Laderman","Helane, I'd caution you to not try to back use our pilot \u2013 high level pilot hiring number to try to back into what our 10-year growth plan assumption is. We don't actually have to use them. There is nothing to be read into that number, it's a nice round number, that's in the order of magnitude of what we will hire over the next decade.","Helane Becker","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. I'll keep it at one question.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning, everyone. So Gerry, I had a question just on, in terms of some free cash flow components. Can you maybe help us understand some of the bigger buckets there particularly in terms of planned pension contributions, anything we should be thinking about on cash taxes and then should we still be expecting CapEx of about $1 billion higher next year than originally planned in 2019?","Gerry Laderman","So let me start with CapEx. As you know, next year is a peak year for us for aircraft deliveries particularly the 17-or-so wide-body aircraft, on top of hopefully a significant number of MAXs and other aircrafts. And so when you start adding all that up and assume kind of a normal level of non-aircraft CapEx, you actually get to a number that's potentially closer to $7 billion, than $6 billion. So it's going to be higher than just $1 billion more than this year, which is still running we think about the $4.9 billion that we said.","With respect to pensions, this year was a little bit of an unusual year because we effectively in September, prepaid contribution that we normally would have made in the first quarter of next year, to save a substantial amount of some fees we otherwise would have been hit with, so this year's total pension contribution slightly over $600 million. I would expect next year to be \u2013 could be potentially zero. But what you should assume right now is probably $300 million at some point during the year.","Andrew Didora","Got it. And just curious on \u2013 when do you become a cash taxpayer?","Gerry Laderman","I really hope it's not for a while other than a small amount of taxes. One of the benefits that we now have that is making up for the \u2013 going through of the NOLs is the 100% expensing on new aircraft that we are now able to take, pretty much on all the new aircraft that are delivering this year and for the next few years.","Andrew Didora","Great, that's helpful. I'll keep it to that. Thank you.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Yes. Hey, just two quick ones here. I guess, first to Andrew, as we think about your 2019 \u2013 excuse me, 2020 capacity headline number and we think about how it relates to the original plan. How many points, assuming that the MAX does come back in January, which does seem less likely, but if we assume the current schedule, how many points tied to the MAX in India? Does that drive that headline number relative to the original plan? Is that about two points, two and a half points?","Andrew Nocella","I think one and a half points is our estimate.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, thanks. And then just my second question, Gerry, for the year on the tax rate you were guiding to 21% to 23% for the first three quarters, it now bumps up by about 100 bps for the full year. What does that \u2013 what's in the fourth quarter? Is that timing? Is that just end of year reconciliation? Anything other than that? Thanks.","Gerry Laderman","It was a result of some choices we had to make on how we were going to take some bonus depreciation that slightly increases the effective tax rate. But economically, it was the right decision to make, there is substantial cash saving that as a result. It's counter intuitive, but to get some actual cash savings, the effective tax rate crept up a little bit.","Michael Linenberg","That's great. I mean, look at the end of the day you have a higher EPS guide. So that's all we care about. Thank you.","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joe DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joe DeNardi","Yes, good morning. Is Luc Bondar on the call by chance?","Scott Kirby","No he is not.","Joe DeNardi","Okay. In my opinion he probably should be, I think he is an asset of United that is doing a lot from an innovation standpoint for the loyalty program. So maybe Scott or Andrew, the level of innovation, I think within United\u2019s program is clearly very different than it is elsewhere in the industry.","And so I'm wondering if you could just talk about in terms of kind of the gamification, personalization of the loyalty program, what that's meaning from the engagement standpoint with your members? And then, how relevant that is along with the improvement in operations to a card issuer when you think about the economics that you'll be able to get?","Scott Kirby","Well, as all these things work together and we set out about two years ago with Luc leading the charge along with Linda on the digital side, we kind of rethink the whole program and what it should look like and how we can make it even better for our customers quite frankly. And PlusPoints is a really good example of an amazing innovation that we put forward and that will be available on the app, it will be easy to use, and it will be simple, the new Value publications. I think will be much easier to understand for our customers going forward.","So we're really excited about that. We're really excited to lead the charge and Luc is doing a great idea. And all of this, as I said in the previous call has resulted in a lot more engagement by our customers. We can see their propensity to hold the credit card or to join the club or to fly more often, or to buy higher fares has all increased versus the previous year by significant amount. And that's all kind of coming together and I think I'll pass it off to Linda because the digital technology used to make all that happen are just been phenomenal.","Linda Jojo","Yes. Thanks, Andrew. I think the way to think about loyalty program is obviously in the way it's designed, but it's ultimately about giving the right offers to our customers to get them to want to fly us. And so we are thinking on all different ways to leverage where our customers want to go and then create very targeted offers, Mile Play is a great example of that where we are using gamification to get customers to really try things that they haven't tried before whether that's a new product or a new location and then rewarding them with currency that is our program.","Andrew Nocella","So we\u2019ll let Luke to know that you\u2019re pretty high on him.","Joe DeNardi","Yes. I appreciate that. I mean, Scott or Andrew, there was some headlines, I don't know a month or two ago that your deal with Chase runs through 2024, 2025 which is a lot longer than I think most deals run. So Scott or Andrew, can you talk about your ability to close the gap in earnings between you and your peers without a new deal or whatever you'd like to say along those lines? Thank you.","Andrew Nocella","What I would say is, we're working really hard with Chase and our new acquisitions last year were up 20% and this year are going to be up 20%. So the teams are working together really well and creating a lot of value, and that's about all I can really say on it. So we're pretty happy with the recent increase in new credit card acquisitions.","Joe DeNardi","Thank you.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we have Catherine O'Brien. Please go ahead.","Catherine O'Brien","Good morning, everyone; thanks for the time. So over the next five or six years, it looks like you have more wide-body aircraft coming up to the global average retirement age than you currently have on order. Should we think about some of those aircraft maybe being replaced by new technology long-range narrow bodies? Would you look to the secondary market? Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.","Scott Kirby","Maybe I'll start off and Gerry can help me on this. We've invested in our 767s and our 777s to extend their life. Both aircrafts are incredible machines and continue to perform well for the company, both from a reliability standpoint and an economic standpoint. So the new Polaris interior is just recently been put on them. So I'm not sure what you're assuming for retirement age. But we're pretty happy with these wide bodies and they can fly for a bit longer.","Gerry Laderman","Yes, I would just add. Yes, over the next, certainly over the next five years, there is really no need to retire any of the wide bodies we're currently flying and that's not our focus right now on the next fleet to retire. To be honest, next fleet to retire, we'll start looking at the remaining 757s that will start coming out.","Catherine O'Brien","Okay, that's great, thanks so much for the color. And then maybe just high level, you guys have discussed quite a few exciting projects that you're looking forward to next year, whether that's more Premium Plus, more CRJ-550s. Like, how should we think about ranking some of these projects in terms of what you see as being the largest drivers of our revenue enhancement for next year? And is there anything else that's on the list that features prominently and how much revenue growth we should see next year just outside of capacity growth? And thanks so much for the time.","Scott Kirby","Well, it's pretty clear we have a large number of commercial initiatives ongoing and they're are all in different stages of roll-out with our segmentation philosophy, I think really expanded and then doing very well for the company. So we're not going to line item, the value that each one of these brings to the bottom line. I provided a small hint that our Premium Plus projects across the globe already has given us a half a point of RASM in the third quarter, which is pretty substantial, given that we just started.","So there is a lot to come and there are initiatives that are coming, that we have yet to announce, which is really exciting. And that's why we're pretty bullish as we look at the outlook for next year, that we know where we're going to be and we're on our road to our EPS target.","Catherine O'Brien","That's great. Looking forward to hearing more in March. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our Q&A for today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Wall Street Journal, we have Alison Sider. Please go ahead.","Alison Sider","Hi, thanks everyone. I was wondering, if you could sort of share anything about what you're hearing in terms of the regulatory process on the MAX, if you're getting that sense there are any disagreements between the FAA and the off room by its push back recertification or, and if that happens, whether you might consider pushing back your own return to service if it's something you have that hasn't yet signed off on?","Oscar Munoz","Yes. So this is Oscar. There is ongoing dialog between and there's a lot of chatter from many different folks. I think the ultimate goal of all regulators around the world is to obviously do the facts and data research on the aircraft and its qualifications and make the right decision. So as far as what we hear and what you hear, I'm not sure it\u2019s entirely pertinent. I think we're all focused on making sure that aircraft is safe and return to flight and when that is. And so \u2013 and to that extent, there is nothing much else to say on that subject.","Alison Sider","I mean, if there was some kind of staggered regulatory process, so would that affect your plans like does that create any issues with your alliance partners this different regulatory authorities have a different view of the planes?","Oscar Munoz","I think, we'll cross that bridge when it comes to. But I don't think so, I think we are overseen by the FAA, and we'll certainly look to that aspect and across the country, across the world, we hope. But I think, we're driving towards a somewhat staggered sort of roll-up and not necessarily one that's going to be in \u2013 measured in lot of time.","Alison Sider","Thank you.","Operator","And from Bloomberg. We have Justin Bachman. Please go ahead.","Justin Bachman","Yes, hi, thanks for the time today. My question is about your nonfuel unit costs over the next few years and the goal to be flat. But as you think of the different revenue initiatives and the plans that United has to grow those revenues and profits over time. How do you balance that against the employee base that obviously would want to share in some of that? And how do you see the longer-term cost picture playing out in terms of employee contracts?","Scott Kirby","We absolutely. As I said in my opening comments, I think that our people are the ones that are delivering these results and they deserve to have increases in compensation and will get those, we built that into our plan. We have the ability to keep costs flat, because we're doing it in other ways. We're doing it by putting, by gauge growth, so flying larger airplane is lower CASM, that we're doing it by constantly getting more efficient.","We're going to be the second year in a row here as we go through the budget process for example where despite growing the airline, despite all kinds of new initiatives and despite giving pay raises to management and administrative employees, we're going to keep total spending there flat. So we're doing a really effective job this team at managing fixed cost and keeping them fixed as we grow the airline and by growing the gauge same time, that gives us the monies to invest in our people, product and customer experience.","Justin Bachman","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now turn it back to Mike Leskinen for closing remarks.","Mike Leskinen","Thanks to you all for joining the call today, please contact Media Relations, if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining, you may now disconnect."],"21043":["United Continental Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 26, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Irene E.

Our earnings release and separate investor update were issued this morning and are available on our website at ir.united.com. Let me point out that information in this morning's earnings press release and investor update and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings, United Airlines and Continental Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Also during the course of the call, we will be discussing several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website.","Unless otherwise noted, as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter, we will be excluding special charges and\/or fuel-hedged, noncash net mark-to-market gains and losses. These items are detailed in our earnings release. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, President and CEO of United.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Thanks, Nene and Tyler, and good morning and thank you, all, for joining us on our first quarter 2012 earnings call. I want to take the opportunity to thank Zane Rowe, our former CFO, for his leadership over the past 19 years. I wish him all the best in his new role with Apple. We have a strong and deep management team, and John Rainey was the clear choice to take over this important role. John is a seasoned finance professional, with many years of airline experience, and my entire team looks forward to working together with him in his new role as CFO.","Moving on to our financial results for the quarter. Today, we reported a net loss of $286 million or an $0.87 loss per share. This was a challenging quarter for United, marked by rising fuel prices and revenue challenges. While we are disappointed to report a loss for this quarter, we remain focused on turning United into a business that sustainably generates returns in excess of our cost of capital, and is able to weather and adapt to any economic environment in which we find ourselves. We remain committed to being the airline that customers want to fly, co-workers want to work for and investors want to invest in. ","During the quarter, we successfully completed the most complex milestone of our integration, the conversion to a single passenger service system, a single loyalty program and a single website, the largest technology conversion in aviation history. I cannot overstate the importance of this conversion and the value that will be created now that it is complete. With this conversion behind us, we now market under a single code, and we can flow our aircraft freely across the network, matching the right aircraft to the right route, which will enable us to deliver on the significant revenue synergies we anticipated from the merger. We will be making many network changes in the coming months, and Jim will speak about that in a few minutes. While the conversion to Shares, our single passenger service system was successful, and we've had solid operational performance afterwards, we had a number of issues which affected some of our customers as one would expect after a massive technology and process change like this. We also aligned many policies and procedures between the carriers and made a number of simultaneous changes to our loyalty program. Moreover, although our new website is materially more advanced than our old one, there are gaps between the functionality of our old website and our new website that we will close over time. These issues initially drove high call volumes, increasing the average wait times for our agents to answer customer calls. As we explained last quarter, we spent significant resources to train our reservation and customer care co-workers on the new system and policy and procedure changes, and we increased staffing levels to support the conversion. Even with the team's preparation, the average wait and handle times at our customer contact centers increased substantially. As a result, in the weeks following the system's conversion, we weren't able to deliver the level of customer service that we wanted and that our customers have come to expect, and I apologize to our customers who were affected during this time. As we identify the issues that were driving high call volumes, we remediated the vast majority of them, and our average speed of answer has fallen substantially, as have our average handle times. As our agents gain experience in the Shares system, we expect handle times to continue to fall and return to normal levels. Despite the complexity of the conversion and the subsequent issues we had, we should not lose sight of the fact that we have safely carried 22 million passengers since the conversion occurred on March 3, and our operating performance, including on-time and completion factor, has been consistent with our performance prior to the conversion. This is a testament to the dedication and commitment of my co-workers.","One silver lining to the stress of our systems conversion is that we discovered some deficiencies in how our subsidiary carriers were dealing with customer service issues before the conversion. As a result, we'll be making changes to items like customer messaging and information flow that will permit us to provide better customer service than we had prior to the systems conversion. ","I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of my co-workers, especially our reservations, customer care and airport co-workers, who worked very hard under stressful conditions, including high load factors due to spring break, to assist our customers after our systems conversion, and our technology team, who worked tirelessly to address issues we encountered and fix them quickly. This was a monumental task for the company, and I'm proud of the way our team performed and worked together. We will continue to invest in our technology and will deploy a new front-end to the Shares system by the end of this year for our airport and contact center agents that will allow my co-workers to serve our customers better and faster than they've ever done before.","The Shares platform is stable, dependable and advanced, due to our ongoing investment in its operating system, hardware and system architecture. Its design give us flexibility and can be integrated with current generation technologies. These characteristics will allow us to operate more efficiently and will significantly increase our speed to market for new products and services. We're already seeing the benefits of moving to Shares. We've seen web sales penetration improve since moving to the single website, powered by Shares, and are experiencing record sales of ancillary products and services on our website. Our new website not only helps improve our ancillary revenue results, but it also improves our direct relationship with our customers. Our off-airport check-in percentage has increased nearly 5 points to almost 50% of all check-ins since moving to Shares. Further confirmation that if we give customers the right tools, they will use them. We plan to continue rolling out new technology to make the travel experience easier for our customers, and to give our customers more information, more choice and more control over their travel experience. ","As I just mentioned, a significant benefit of moving to Shares is our improved ability to generate substantial incremental ancillary revenue. We will use the flexibility of the new platform to deliver new pricing structures and bundling opportunities for existing products. Shares also will facilitate the faster introduction of new innovative products, which will result in a better portfolio of offerings that our customers desire, as well as new revenue streams for the company. Since the launch of the single website, we have already taken the first of several planned steps to more effectively revenue manage Economy Plus upsell. Prior to our conversion, we were limited to a single price point for every Economy Plus seat on a given flight. Since converting to Shares, we now have the ability to vary pricing, based on a number of factors, including row type, seat type, days from departure and more. Due to this new functionality, we've been able to increase the average price of an Economy Plus seat in March by 9% year-over-year. And when combined with the increasing number of Economy Plus seats available, total Economy Plus sales in March increased 37%. Now that we have a single loyalty program, Mileage Plus, we're able to begin unlocking the significant value creation potential that exists with operating the world's largest loyalty program. The large membership base, a highly recognized and coveted mileage currency, the leading portfolio of co-brand credit cards and a strong network of loyalty business partners, provide the platform upon which we will innovate and drive incremental margin moving forward. We designed a frequent flier benefit structure of the integrated loyalty program to better recognize and reward value-creating behaviors of our customers and to better stratify membership tiers so that benefits logically and progressively improve as higher status tiers are reached. We launched Premium MileagePlus club card in March, building on the strong performance we're seeing for the MileagePlus Explorer card that we launched last July. ","We're excited about the opportunities we see in our loyalty business. These include new ways to engage with membership, strengthening and expanding the network of business partners that participate in the MileagePlus loyalty network and increasing the utility of the currency through innovative earning and redemption opportunities such as our recently launched partnership with Gilt, Exclusive Resorts and Topguest, as well as the launch of our new auctions program, MileagePlus Headliners, and the Gift Card Exchange. We believe the loyalty space has significant high margin opportunity in the coming years, and we plan to capitalize on it. ","We took a number of actions to ease the stress at our airports during the Shares conversion, such as pulling down the flight schedule, limiting our overbooking levels and waiving certain fees in the days following the conversion. While beneficial to the operations, these actions adversely impacted our revenue results this quarter. Over the longer-term, however, we believe that our investments in integration and new products and services will continue to drive a revenue premium to the industry. Economy Plus seating, which offers up to 5 extra inches of leg room versus standard Economy seating, is now on 75% of our combined mainline fleet, and we expect to have all mainline aircraft reconfigured by the end of the year. Our lie-flat premium seat installation on our international widebody fleet is nearly complete, with the remaining aircraft to be completely retrofitted by this time next year. We'll begin installing our satellite-based global Wi-Fi network at the end of the year, which when completed, will cover our entire mainline fleet. We also continue to invest in customer pleasing and fuel-efficient aircraft. We expect to induct 5 Boeing 787 Dreamliners into service this year and we recently completed a EETC transaction that financed 4 Dreamliners and 14 737-900ER aircraft and refinanced 3 additional 737-900ERs, with the lowest blended coupon rate ever for a EETC transaction. ","The Dreamliner is a spectacular aircraft and a game changer for United. And we can't wait for our customers and co-workers to experience it. We'll be the first North American carrier to take delivery of this revolutionary airplane. During the quarter, we also made progress bringing together our employee groups. We achieved a tentative agreement with our subsidiary United flight attendants, which was recently ratified. We now turn our attention to joint negotiations to bring all of our flight attendants under a single collective bargaining agreement. Our passenger service employees completed their representation election. We've begun joint negotiations with them. All representation issues have now been concluded with our major domestic unions, and we're in joint collective bargaining with the unions of all of our major work groups.","We remain focused on bringing our work groups together as promptly as we can with responsible joint collective bargaining agreements that pay competitively, which will be fair to our co-workers and fair to the company. While this quarter was challenging for us, we remain committed to taking the actions necessary to achieve sustained and sufficient profitability. Now that we are one airline with a single code, a single passenger service system, a single loyalty program, a single website and single policies and procedures, we are on the steep back slope of our integration. This permits us to shift our focus to expanding the products and services that customers want and are willing to pay for, and delivering on our commitment to customer service. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim and John to go through the results in greater detail.","James E. Compton","Thanks, Jeff. I join Jeff in thanking our co-workers for their hard work this quarter and our customers for choosing to fly United. United's first quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue increased 5.2%, and mainline PRASM improved 4.1% versus the first quarter of 2011. Yield improvements again drove our revenue gains this quarter. We faced a number of headwinds and challenges in the first quarter that put pressure on our PRASM results, including challenging comps, higher completion factor and our systems conversion. We are not satisfied with our results this quarter and are very focused on improving our performance in the future. Over the past few months, we took significant steps in integrating our revenue management and booking system, including moving to a single inventory management system and completing our conversion to Shares. With these tools in place, our revenue management and network planning team can now seamlessly manage our inventory, identify better route opportunities and gather a robust history of data, which we will use to make better demand forecast and revenue management decisions. Technology deployments of this scale are never easy, and we have learned much in the process. Our new inventory management system is the leading technology available to support revenue management activities. But after the conversion to the single system, we saw a decline in connecting traffic as we were in the learning phase of the new system, which negatively affected our load factors in the first quarter. I am pleased to say that based on our recent booking data, we believe the issue is behind us and we are now seeing connecting traffic builds consistent with historical patterns. ","To support the operations around our conversion to Shares, we took steps to reduce overbooking to minimize customer disruption as our co-workers got up to speed on the new system. Now that we have over 1.5 months of using the system, we have returned to our historic booking levels, which will support better revenue performance in April and beyond.","We estimate that the synergy due to the system conversions this quarter to be approximately 1 point year-over-year PRASM growth. Even with this headwind, we expect to achieve our full year 2012 total synergy target. Our best tools to manage revenue, particularly in an environment of high fuel prices, are capacity discipline and putting the right aircraft in the right market to generate revenue premium. Our first quarter consolidated capacity increased by 0.3% versus the same period in 2011, with the leap year driving the increase. First quarter domestic mainline PRASM increased 4.5%, and yields increased 3.3% year-over-year. Domestic mainline capacity decreased 3% as compared to last year. Regional PRASM grew by 9.1% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2011. We successfully raised domestic fares twice since the start of the year, and we continue to focus on ensuring that we receive compensatory pricing for our products.","International unit revenue increased 3.8% in the first quarter versus 2011. First quarter international yields improved 5.6%, while international capacity increased 3.4% in the quarter. Latin America was again United's best performing entity this quarter, with PRASM up 7% in the first quarter and yields up 6.9% versus 2011. South America results continue to fuel much of the growth in the Latin America entity. South America PRASM and yields were up about 11% this quarter, with solid results in both the Premium and Economy cabins. Trans-Atlantic PRASM increased 5.3%, and yields increased 6% year-over-year in the first quarter. Results throughout the region were mixed this quarter, with some outstanding performers like Germany, where PRASM was up 8%, and premium cabin PRASM was up 20% year-over-year, and some laggards like India, where PRASM was up only 2% year-over-year. In light of the economic challenges Europe is facing, we continue to evaluate which markets we serve.","In the Pacific, we faced a number of challenges, including increased competitive capacity to China and Hong Kong, and less exposure to the resurging Japan market relative to our peers. Our Pacific PRASM declined 0.2% in the first quarter and yields increased 4.1% versus 2011. Japan was the top performing country, with PRASM and yields increasing about 15% versus the first quarter 2011. The Australian market continues to perform well with PRASM up 6% and yields up 9% year-over-year. While China was under pressure this quarter, we continue to believe that our unmatched presence in China is a long-term competitive advantage for United, and we are well positioned to take advantage of a growing Chinese economy. ","Overall, our footprint in the Pacific is unmatched by any U.S. carrier, and the region remains one of our most profitable entities. As we have seen over the last year, corporate revenue continued to show steady improvement this quarter as corporate customers respond favorably to our ability to offer them the best network in the world. Corporate revenue increased more than 10% this quarter, with yields up about 4% versus first quarter 2011. First quarter cargo revenue declined 6.7% versus the same period last year. As in the past few quarters, volumes across most entities declined as fuel surcharges continued to increase and air cargo demand declined. As with passenger capacity, the Pacific saw additional industry cargo capacity come online. Last quarter, we mentioned how having a single passenger service system will provide us the opportunity to introduce new ancillary products and better target customers with our existing ancillary products. As a result of the Shares conversion, we temporarily lost the ability to sell some existing ancillary products, such as our Premier Travel and Premier Line options, and it is a top priority to fill those gaps. Even with these temporary gaps, ancillary revenue in the first quarter grew by about 7% year-over-year. Our ancillary revenue generation through our website has grown dramatically since the conversion to Shares, with sales for the last week in March nearly double our sales in the last week in January. Our customers continue to show they are willing to pay a premium for better seats with increases in Economy Plus and Premium Cabin upsell options year-over-year.","Part of our business planning at United is the ongoing evaluation of the economic and demand environment. And in March, much like we did multiple times in 2011, we announced plans to reduce our full year consolidated capacity. The current economic environment is still uncertain, with pockets of strength and weakness, and oil remains high and volatile. We expect our 2012 capacity to decrease between 0.5% and 1.5% versus 2011, which will make our airline 1% smaller than we were in 2010 and 7% smaller than we were in 2008. We expect second quarter 2012 consolidated capacity to decrease between 0.3% and 1.3% year-over-year. ","In addition to cutting capacity in 2012, we will capitalize on our systems conversion and the opportunities it presents to freely move our aircraft around the network and better match capacity with demand. Redeploying our existing aircraft across the network is a critical enabler of our revenue synergies. In the second quarter of this year, approximately 15% of our mainline departures will be redeployed flights. Along with better matching aircraft to the right markets to improve profitability of existing routes, redeployment allows us to initiate new flights, such as our service from Washington\/Dulles to Dublin and Manchester using a Boeing 757-200, and seasonal service from Houston to Jackson Hole this summer with a domestic 757. Our redeployment plans will accelerate into the fall and winter of this year.","Turning to our near-term revenue outlook. We continue to experience difficult comps year-over-year, and we estimate United's April consolidated PRASM will increase about 5%. This PRASM estimate is preliminary, based on the data we have for April thus far. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks, Jim. This was a challenging quarter, with significant integration efforts across the company. And I want to thank the United team for doing a great job of managing through the complexities of our systems integration. I'm excited for the opportunity ahead of me in my new role, and I want to take a moment to thank my predecessor, Zane Rowe. I worked with Zane for most of my 15 years at Continental and United. There are very few people who have given more of themselves to this company than he has. He's been a great mentor and a great friend, and we will miss him. ","Moving to our results. United's consolidated operating expense increased 7.6% or $618 million year-over-year in the first quarter. Fuel costs represented over $550 million of that increase, as jet fuel prices rose 20% versus 2011. First quarter consolidated and mainline unit costs increased more than 7% year-over-year. Our first quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel and third-party business expense, increased 0.7% versus 2011. Holding fuel rate and profit-sharing constant, and excluding third-party business expense, consolidated unit costs increased only 0.6% year-over-year in the quarter. Nonoperating expense for the quarter was $176 million, nearly $70 million lower than the first quarter of 2011. The biggest single contributor to the decrease was a reduction in interest expense of roughly $40 million, as we continue our focus on strengthening the balance sheet. As Jim discussed, our revenue growth faced headwinds this quarter, both from integration-related activities and from more difficult comparisons to the first quarter of 2011, a period where we realized very strong revenue growth. In January 2011, we implemented FASB rule ASU 2009-13, a required change to our frequent flyer revenue recognition policy. This resulted in a reduction in the amount of passenger revenue that is deferred into the future and contributed to our revenue growth last year. This change in accounting better matches our revenue recognition to our cash flow.","All in, we recorded a pretax loss of $283 million for the first quarter. While we are never pleased with a loss, the first quarter was somewhat unique in that it included our most substantive integration efforts with a backdrop of higher fuel prices and trepidation over the European debt crisis, with all of this happening in what is already a seasonally slower period. Our focus remains the same as it has been: on generating sustainable profits over the business cycle that exceed our cost of capital. While painful, the integration efforts in the first quarter were a huge enabling step toward our achievement of that goal. Our return on invested capital for the last 12 months was 10.5%, still in excess of our cost of capital.","Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $7.8 billion in unrestricted liquidity, including an undrawn credit facility of $500 million. We reduced debt again this quarter, paying over $500 million in debt and capital lease obligations, including $92 million in prepayments. We have about $890 million of scheduled debt maturities and capital lease payments remaining in 2012. Gross capital expenditures were $403 million in the quarter. As Jim mentioned, we recently reduced our expected 2012 capacity guidance to a decline of 0.5% to 1.5% versus 2011. Despite this, we are not projecting an increase in our unit costs from our prior guidance. As we pull capacity out of the system, we need to also take out the associated costs by an amount that is as close to CASM-neutral as possible. We are keeping our full year 2012 consolidated unit cost guidance, excluding fuel, profit-sharing and third-party business expense, at an increase of 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year. We expect our second quarter 2012 consolidated unit cost, excluding fuel, profit-sharing and third-party businesses expense, to be up 3% to 4% year-over-year. We are seeing some inflationary pressure in the second quarter in salaries and related costs of new labor agreements put in place last year and earlier this year. Regional expenses also up year-over-year as we restructured certain regional flying. ","As we disclosed in our December investor update, we are now excluding third-party business expense from our core unit costs. Third-party business expenses are those associated with activities that do not generate seat miles, such as providing maintenance, ground handling and catering services for other airlines, as well as components of the MileagePlus Program, like non-air mileage redemptions. The revenue associated with these activities is recorded in the other revenue line. Third-party business expense was $65 million in the first quarter and is expected to be approximately $70 million in the second quarter and $330 million for the full year.","Based on the forward curve, as of April 18, we expect our consolidated fuel price to be $3.44 per gallon in the second quarter and $3.40 per gallon for the full year. We have hedged 37% of our expected second quarter fuel consumption at an average Gulf Coast jet equivalent of $3.18 per gallon. We have hedged 36% of our expected fuel consumption for the second half of 2012 using a combination of collars, swaps and calls. We continue to improve our fleet with modern, fuel-efficient aircraft. And in the first quarter, we took delivery of 4 737-900ER aircraft. By the end of 2012, we expect to take delivery of an additional 15 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft and induct into service 5 787 Dreamliners. As a result, we expect gross capital expenditures to be $2.35 billion in 2012 or $1.25 billion net of expected financing. We are also removing older, less fuel-efficient aircraft from the fleet. In the first quarter of 2012, we removed 5 Boeing 737-500s from scheduled service. In total, we intend to retire 28 mainline aircraft by the end of 2012, which includes an additional 13 737-500s, 5 757-200s and 5 767-200s. ","I want to close by saying that I look forward to working in my new role with my talented colleagues and a team of more than 80,000 here at United. This industry is changing and we are changing with it. While it is clearly too early to declare victory, we are making tremendous progress, taking actions that remove volatility and de-risk the business will have a pronounced effect on our ability to invest in our product, to provide a stable company for our co-workers and to create sustainable value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Thanks, John. This was a pivotal quarter for our company. We now have our largest integration milestones behind us, and we can focus on unlocking United's full potential, becoming the airline that customers want to fly, co-workers want to work for and investors want to invest in. Sustained and sufficient profitability is the only path forward, and we're confident that we'll deliver. I'll now turn it over to Tyler to open up the call for questions.","Tyler Reddian","Thanks, Jeff. First, we'll take questions from the analyst community, then we'll take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, actually 2 questions here. Actually, John, you touched on -- you talked about some of the regional costs. So the situation with Pinnacle and the fact that it looks like they're going away and it looks like someone else is going to pick up those airplanes and it seems like you may be bringing back -- maybe you've already brought back some Embraer 135s, how should we think about that as it relates to -- think about it being as a cost wind -- a cost headwind. It appears that Pinnacle may have had a better deal that wasn't sustainable over the long-term. Is there going to be, not just a cost hit, but are we going to see sort of any revenue hiccup from them leaving?","John Rainey","Yes. Mike, I'd say there's 2 things that will affect our regional costs going forward. One, as you mentioned, Pinnacle is going through a restructuring and we will transition a lot of the flying that they're doing for the balance of the year. The second piece of that, as part of the transition flying that they're doing, in the first quarter, we restructured the Saab 340 flying they were doing from us -- doing for us, from a pro-rate agreement to a capacity purchase agreement. The effect that, that has is we now pick up the associated expenses in our regional line but we also pick up the associated revenue in our revenue line where that wasn't there before. So you'll see a similar trend year-over-year through the following quarters this year that you saw in the first quarter.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Who is picking up the flying? Is it a household name or I see this little company Silver may be picking it up? What can you say on that?","John Rainey","Well, we have a transition agreement with Colgan right now and we have not disclosed. We're actually still negotiating who's going to do that flying for us.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, very good. And then just my second question. Back, Jim made the comment, Jim, you said it was a -- the cutover impacted your unit revenue by, I think, you said a point. Was that just for the month or the quarter or is that a full year impact? I wasn't sure the timeframe.","James E. Compton","Mike, this is Jim. Yes, it was a quarter impact, the 1 point.","Operator","From Rodman & Renshaw, we have Dan McKenzie on the line.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","New products, new revenue streams. Can you talk about the timing for implementing some of those and perhaps some idea of the materiality?","James E. Compton","Dan, this is Jim. With the conversion to Shares and the migration to the subsidiary, continental.com site, now known as the united.com. As we mentioned, there were certain products that were sold on the sub-United side that weren't on the Continental side. So there were about half a dozen, 6 or 7. An example is, for instance, United had an Economy Plus subscription that drove ancillary revenue. Or another one is United Club online onetime passes at the clubs and so forth. Those are gaps that we have right now, and the team is working over the next several months to close those gaps, to capture those revenues going forward.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up question on the reservation system cutover, how much of a hangover effect from the inventory holdback is there, if any, as we look at April PRASM here? I think it was 1%, if I understood correctly, for the month of March?","James E. Compton","Yes, Dan. It's -- in terms of what we -- the teams work across the company in terms of overbooking, so I'd say that impact is behind us. It was early in the month of March with the March 3 date, as well as some of the spring break peak periods, what we did is we lowered the authorization levels on overbooking to support some of the heavy volumes that we expected over spring break and the learning curve on the new system. That tends to be most behind us. The other piece of it that I mentioned on connecting traffic might have a little bit of a tail in April as we rebuild that. We made some changes to our revenue management system kind of mid-March to begin to correct for that. So there might be a little bit of it -- there might be some tail on the connecting traffic as we kind of look at April.","Operator","From Barclays, we have David Fintzen on the line.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a question on -- if I sort of read the headlines on Europe and Asia, you'd almost think that your commentary on the entities will be a bit flipped. And I know that there's kind of capacity differences and growth differences. But can you kind of help us reconcile why you're seeing a sort of strength in premium Europe and maybe how that compares to the cabin performance in Asia, sort of premium versus non-premium?","James E. Compton","Yes. I think kind of a general statement, I would say, is that our premium cabin traffic is doing very well across all the entities. And if you break down the entities, when you look at Japan, first of all, I talked about -- about 38% of our capacity is in Japan and 60% non-Japan markets. And as I mentioned, that 38%, actually 15%, was our RASM growth in those Japan markets. If our capacity was similar, quite frankly, people compare us to Delta. If our capacity were Delta, 78% of its ASMs in Japan, we would've added 9 points in PRASM to our Pacific entity and so forth. So there really is a real structural piece, and that structural piece is the Asia piece. Particularly in Hong Kong. We faced -- we've talked about increased competition in Chicago-Hong Kong. But Hong Kong, in general, the industry capacity is about up 20% in the first quarter, we're down about 2%. We managed capacity down a little bit with some holiday cancellations and so forth. Quite frankly, that's put pressure on our PRASM in that part of the world in Asia. As we think about that part of the world, we think our footprint, historically, has been terrific there, it's again, a very profitable entity for us, Pacific as well as Asia. It's unmatched, our portfolio, and with the growing economy in China, we think we're well positioned in Asia. But it was a tough quarter and it was a tough quarter partly with the industry capacity growth. In addition, we're improving our product, so that many of those flights with the 747 have been updated to IPTE, but we're not done. For instance, we'll be putting streaming video within the cabin beginning this summer, into the coach cabin that still relies on kind of old technology from an IFE perspective. And quite frankly, our 787 order, the portfolio we will build over the next several years, with the 5 that Jeff mentioned coming this year and then obviously the portfolio of 50 over the next several years, really is going to give us the ability to react much more to competitive environment such as that 20%, with really a terrific airplane that will help us match capacity with demand. So when you put that in altogether, we're actually very excited about our Pacific. Within the Pacific, it's really those structural pieces that kind of explained our RASM. Trans-Atlantic, as I mentioned in my comments, we had just different performance across the board, strong performance in Germany, some of the secondary markets not so much, so we're evaluating that. The capacity reductions that we announced in March really do kind of address some of that towards the second half of the year, where mainly many of them are in the Trans-Atlantic with our exit from such as Copenhagen and then in that entity over to Accra. So we're actually very, very focused on that as we look at capacity. I would say that historically, our -- managing capacity is one of discipline and steady discipline. We actually think that we manage costs better if we're not doing wild swings in capacity and we're able to be more predictable for our corporate customers, for the markets, for the customer, as well as just in general of the marketplace and so forth. So we're going to continue that discipline capacity, but I think you'll see it be at stable, not to say that we won't, as I mentioned, look at markets and move markets. But I think we're pretty happy with our position in the Trans-Atlantic right now.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just as you look at the Trans-Atlantic, I mean, are there point-of-sale differences that, strength the U.S. economy is maybe offsetting the recession in a lot of Europe? Is there anything sort of visible from sort of that macro perspective?","James E. Compton","Yes. The U.S. point-of-sale continues to be very strong for us and that's -- as my comments on the premium cabin really drives that, we're seeing strong strength in the premium cabin driven by the corporate business revenue going forward, but a good U.S. sale -- U.S. point-of-sale.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just a quick one on that 15% redeployment statistic you had for 2Q, how should we think about that long-term? I mean, does it ultimately become -- is it 40% of the network when you get it fully optimized and where kind of are we in that process?","James E. Compton","Well, the team -- we're very early in the process, obviously, with the second quarter being 15%, which is one of our -- as we get excited about the ability with this network to drive the synergies. Quite frankly, we're working through those numbers. It will accelerate, particularly in the second half of the year, but the network -- ultimately, we'll watch the marketplace and keep managing that. So I wouldn't want to commit to where that actually ends up, but will accelerate in the second half of the year.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Bill Greene on the line.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the New York market. Delta talked about some big wins that they feel they're getting as a result of the slot swap. Do you think maybe the cutover caused you to have some market share slippage at all in New York? Or was -- are you not really seeing an effect from them? I'm just curious how New York is performing?","James E. Compton","Bill, this is Jim. Actually, no we're not. Our strong New York base with the -- with our hub in Newark has worked well for us, and actually we've seen corporate revenue in the fourth quarter grow out of New York, as well as our share. And so we're seeing good progress as the sales team gets out and talks about the value of this new network. We're getting great response from our corporate partners across the system, but also particularly in New York.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, if US Air were to leave the Star Alliance, does that have a material impact at all on your P&L?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Bill, this is Jeff. I'm not going to speculate on whatever should happen there. But U.S. Airways is a good partner of ours, and if they were to leave the Star Alliance, it would have an impact on us and that would be, on that piece, negative to us. On the other hand, if they left as a result of a consolidation, I think that'd be very good. It'd be very good for the business and very good for the industry. And consolidation, as you know, has worked well for this business. And I think net to us, if US Airways were leaving for a consolidation that seems to be in the lot -- in the news today, I think net-net that'd be positive for United Airlines.","Operator","From Wolfe Trahan we have Hunter Keay online.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","A couple of questions for you on -- well, I guess just one on costs. On fuel specifically, fuel price is up about 20%, guidance looks a little unfavorable, which I realize could be a timing issue when you price it out where the strip was. But yesterday I asked US Airways if they would change their position on hedging, if they were involved in consolidation, and it seemed to me like their answer was basically no, we think hedging doesn't make a lot of sense. So I guess my question for you is, given your balance sheet particularly, which I think should invite a little bit of commercial risk-taking, do competitor-hedged books factor into your decision to hedge to the degree that you do? Or is it more an internal risk tolerance decision?","John Rainey","Well, that's a great question, Hunter. And they absolutely do. I mean, fundamentally, I think, like you believe as well, we think that fares in this industry over a longer period of time need to respond to cost inputs, and our competitors need to have the same pressure in terms of those cost inputs for that to happen. And so clearly, we don't want to get too far out of balance with what our competitors are doing. That said, we have a pretty consistent policy with respect to our hedging. It's not really taking speculative positions, it's one more of risk management. I think that in this industry, when you're selling tickets out 6 to 12 months in advance, you're then exposed for movements in fuel prices after those tickets are sold, and that's why you see us hedged in that time period to protect against that and guard against volatility in our earnings.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, John. And a couple of years ago when Spirit -- maybe it was 1.5 years ago or so, when Spirit announced they were charging for carry-ons, Congress summoned a number of airlines CEOs to basically promise Congress that they would never do the same thing. Jeff, you were running Continental at the time, you were conspicuously absent, was that a scheduling conflict or is there any particular reason why you didn't show up for that hearing?","Jeffery A. Smisek","I guess I never received the call. I don't recollect.","Operator","From Evercore Partners, we have Duane Pfennigwerth online.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just following up on the regional question. Can you talk about your commitment to the Q, to the Q400 specifically, and is that some of the flying that you're transitioning or would you expect that to be replaced with RJs?","James E. Compton","Well, the Q400 is a plane that works very well for us, particularly in some of the shorter haul markets and some of our hubs like Houston and Newark. I think that we're going to continue to have that product in terms of the mix of that versus RJs. I can't speculate on that right now.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So even though Pinnacle's winding it down and returning them, you'd expect to have Qs in your fleet, is that fair?","James E. Compton","Yes. Yes.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the Asia Pac capacity trends, any relief on the horizon as you look over the June and September quarters?","James E. Compton","Duane, I'm sorry I missed that.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just the competing capacity trends, the pressure that you're seeing in Asia Pac, do you see any favorable relief on the horizon as you look out over the next couple of quarters with respect to...","James E. Compton","The competitive pressure will be there. I think our prospective LA-Shanghai, we lap [ph] in May. So a little bit of an offset there. But Chicago-Hong Kong, for instance, Cathay started last September. So that pressure will be there in the near term.","Operator","From Dahlman Rose, we have Helane Becker.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you just -- maybe this is for Jeff. There is a bit of a battle brewing in Houston with the city council set to consider next month whether or not they will approve the airport at Hobby's suggestion that they build an international terminal. Can you just talk about your thoughts with the opposition that you've talked about and so on, and how that changes your views towards Latin expansion?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Sure, Helane. And just to be clear, this isn't us fighting Southwest flying internationally. I mean we clearly compete against Southwest, and we do it very well every day. Intercontinental Airport is obviously a significant hub and a tremendous engine of the economy in Houston. And we and other airlines and the city have made a lot of investments in IAH, and it's become a premier international gateway, it's a superb hub and it works very well. And it has a great deal of connectivity, it's a high-connecting hub. And we need those connections, we and the other carriers who operate there, to fill the planes, obviously, to make all of the broad array of flights that we offer and competitors offer at IAH. And that airport has clearly has excess capacity for international flying. I mean, there are gates there that have only one flight a day, literally. So there's plenty of capacity and plenty of FIS capacity as well for the traffic. Our issue really is splitting the hub, turning -- having 2 hubs in effect, Houston competing against Houston, versus Houston competing against Atlanta or Miami or DFW. From a public policy perspective, it's a huge mistake. It will, clearly if that were to occur, it would reduce the flight opportunities at IAH, it would result in loss of air service, it would result in loss of jobs and it would result in wasteful spending and it would be extremely bad public policy for the city of Houston to do that.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Got you. The other question I have is with respect to your unit revenue growth, and maybe this is one for Jim or John. Are you concerned about the fact that your unit revenue is growing kind of half the industry average right now?","James E. Compton","Helane, this is Jim. I think, obviously, we're always focused on our relative performance. But I also think that we are historically a high RASM carrier that ran historically high RASMs last year. So when I think about percentage growth and our relative percent, I actually want to think about it over a longer period of time. And so when I think about that, I think about where we're at in the integration, as I mentioned very early in the redeployment and so forth. So I think we're obviously very focused on that. From my perspective, I'm comfortable with it. And because of where we've come from, our high levels, and what we have coming forward, we get really excited about.","John Rainey","Helane, this is John. I would just add to that, that the change in frequent flyer accounting for us does affect our year-over-year RASM results. For the full year, it's a little bit less than a point. But the effect of that will become more pronounced in the second quarter where it's over a point of RASM headwind, and then it abates as we go through the balance of the year.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, when does TSA PreCheck come to Newark? By any chance, do you know that?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Helane, it's rolling out, and we'd like it in all of our hubs as quickly as we can get it. I think it's a tremendous program, and I've got to commend John Pistole for focusing on the importance of thoughtful security. So I think that we're big supporters of it, and we want to and we want and will be participating in it and we're working closely with TSA to get it done as quickly as we can.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Actually, I was also going to ask about PreCheck, just because it seems like you did with Wi-Fi, you've sort of ceded a competitive advantage to American and Delta, but I assume that's not a permanent decision then, Jeff?","Jeffery A. Smisek","No, absolutely not. No. I mean, now that we're in a position to do it now, and we will be doing it and Jamie, I hope you qualify.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My primary question is to Jim, you've obviously guided to an April RASM figure that looks like it'll be among the worst in the industry, so the statement that things are snapping back and returning to normal is a little bit difficult for me to reconcile only because we've been assuming that portions of the RASM deficiency were self-inflicted. You add some helpful disclosures on Asia, and I appreciate that. The competition has suggested that May is tougher than April, but June should at least equal April, maybe even improve on April's results, I know you don\u2019t want to give RASM guidance, but -- structurally for the next quarter, is there anything unique to United that wouldn't allow you to kind of move along the RASM change trajectory that the competition has laid out?","James E. Compton","Jamie, it's Jim. I think obviously there were industry comps last year, they were very strong, they were the comps that John just talked about. So to -- obviously, you're right, not commenting about RASM going forward. May was a very strong industry RASM last year and, for the industry, more so than June as you described. So I think from that sense, we based kind of the same profile for us, and then the question is are some of the other comps that are unique to us, how that fits into that.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Josh Freed from the Associated Press.","Josh Freed","You mentioned that there are some of the ancillary products that, if I understood you right, that are not available right now on the new -- kind of newly revamped website. So to the extent that, that's the case, does that mean that those products sort of don't exist right now for -- in terms of being available for new sales or are they still available through other channels or...","James E. Compton","Yes, this is Jim. They're not available through other channels. What we want to do is move them to the web as well as to kiosks at the airport, and that's the PSS gap that the team's working really hard to close. I want to say that -- again, we're excited about it because the ancillary products that we have are actually growing at a extremely strong rate. And so, overall, ancillary revenue is growing at a very strong rate, as we mentioned, at 7% in the first quarter.","Josh Freed","Sure. Do you have an estimate then for how much it's hurting that growth or hurting revenue, to not have those available right now?","James E. Compton","Yes. We wouldn't disclose that. It's not a really significant number, but it's part of a portfolio of products that customers enjoy in terms building the experience. Really, the goal for us is to bring the products so that the customer can participate and have choices. And so there's about half a dozen of them, all at different levels of performance. But I wouldn't want to mention what those are doing.","Operator","From Wall Street Journal, we have Susan Carey online.","Susan Carey","This is probably a question for Jim. I'm trying to -- I just want to make sure I understand this. You're saying you had a 1 percentage point of RASM reduction in the first quarter due to these various issues, the Shares conversion, what's going on in Asia Pacific and the revenue management cutover. But I'm wondering if you could just help me a little bit more on the latter. I guess you integrated the CAL revenue management system into the United system, I'm wondering when you did that and what caused this sort of reduction in your connecting traffic and how much was that a factor in this 1% reduction in RASM?","James E. Compton","So it's about half of the effect in terms of the connecting traffic of the total. And we can work with you offline. It's very technical, not to skirt the question. But revenue management systems are very sophisticated systems, and I think I'd use a lot of time trying to explain it, but we could probably help with that.","Operator","And from Bloomberg News, we have Mary Jane Credeur online.","Mary Jane Credeur","I want to elaborate on Jamie Baker's question. I think a number of us still have a little bit of bafflement over the explanation for that April RASM forecast. Can you talk a little bit more about what your biggest concern is about those underlying trends or are there 1 or 2 facets you can point to that give you the most heartache about it? I mean that's less than half of what your next biggest peer forecast, it's significantly smaller than what Airways forecast?","James E. Compton","This is Jim. My concerns are really kind of how quickly we can begin to innovate and chase the synergies and so forth, which we're actually starting to do now. So the underlying trends in April, that's where we're at. We actually are comfortable with where they're at given where we are in the migration -- in the merger and so forth. What the team is really focused on is one, closing what Jeff mentioned a lot, about gaps that we've learned about customer service due to the cutover, as well as spooling up the synergies that are associated with optimizing the network, that I mentioned in my comments, that we're moving to 15% of the flights -- of the mainline flights in the second quarter will be redeployment. So concerns I have are really just the team staying focused on achieving the things that we said we're going to achieve, and we feel really good about that, where we're at, and very excited about what we have coming forward.","Irene E.

Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Smisek","Thanks Nene and Jonathan and thank you for joining on our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Today we reported pre-tax earnings of $585 million, the highest first quarter profit in United's history and over $1 billion improvement compared to the first quarter of last year. We earned $1.52 per diluted share, achieved at pre-tax margin of 6.8% and expanded our return on invested capital to 17.1% over the last 12 months. In the quarter we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow and repurchased $200 million of our common stock.","Our cost discipline continued in the first quarter with non-fuel unit cost down 1.5% year-over-year bringing our average non-fuel unit cost over the prior four quarters to approximately flat with only 0.4% capacity growth. It is also the seventh straight quarter in which we improved productivity. We continue to deliver on our goals under Project Quality our $2 billion efficiency initiative and we\u2019re making substantial progress on improving our balance sheet. Additionally, in the first quarter our operational performance improved nicely with year-over-year improvements in our on time arrival and completion performance. This quarter all four of our Northern tier hubs experienced more snow days and more de-icing events than the first quarter of last year which you'll remember was a very tough winter. Yet we cancelled 17,000 fewer flights inconveniencing 1.3 million fewer customers. Importantly, we've delivered our operational improvements while also increasing the efficiency and productivity. ","We made improvements across every part of our business in the first quarter and we could not have done this without the dedication and professionalism of our employees. I want to thank them for their great work and their pride in United. I'm pleased that each quarter we've been building on previous accomplishments. We expect that the second quarter will be another record quarter for United with pre-tax margins between 12% and 14% driven by strong cost performance and lower oil prices.","At United we manage our business to maximize shareholder value. While unit revenue is an important metric we ultimately make business decisions to maximize margin and return on invested capital. In this morning's investor update, we provided second quarter unit revenue guidance of down 4% to 6%. Jim Compton will explain the component of our second quarter present guide in more detail in just a minute. But I want to mention that some of the decline is directly related to earnings, accretive action that by their nature are at present dilutive. The remaining anticipated unit revenue decline is due to external factors that we\u2019re working to mitigate where we can. United has been the industry leader in capacity discipline and as we've shown in the past we'll take the appropriate actions to ensure we are matching capacity with demand.","Accordingly, today we reduced our full year capacity guidance by half a point and now expect to grow 1% to 2% in 2015. The first quarter was a good quarter for United in which we improved our operations, expanded earnings, generated significant free cash flow, paid down debt and returned cash to shareholders. We will continue to work aggressively to bolster our revenue and increase our efficiency while maintaining our focus on expanding our margins and return on invested capital. Over the last several quarters we have demonstrated that our plan is working and we remain excited about the opportunities ahead.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim, Greg and John.","Jim Compton","Thanks Jeff. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our customers for flying United. Every day we are working to improve our reliability, our product and our offering of destinations and schedule you desire.","In the first quarter, our unit revenue was up 0.4%, higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance. Our domestic unit revenue was up 1.6% and our international unit revenue was down 0.5%. Our domestic unit revenue performance was largely driven by lower capacity in the quarter that would than anticipated results from our revenue initiatives and the timing of Easter. A contributor to our strong domestic performance was the re-banking of our schedules in Denver and Houston. We have seen both yields and volume of connecting traffic increase year-over-year in these hubs. We rebased Chicago in March and are pleased with the initial results. Our domestic results were also positively impacted by the timing of Easter this year, as Easter travel began in the first quarter. This provided a tailwind of 0.5 points to the consolidated network. This Easter travel share will reduce PRASM by a similar magnitude in the second quarter.","Transatlantic unit revenue increased 6.9% in the quarter, mostly driven by our seasonal shaping initiative which reduced this flying during the lower demand in winter period while increasing flying during the higher demand summer period. This initiative helps to offset the pressure from a strengthening dollar, which generated a headwind of 1.4 points of PRASM in the Atlantic entities. Pacific unit revenue was down 7.4% primarily due to four factors; first, the weakening currencies in the Pacific contributed approximately 2 points of unit revenue decline; second, we grew our Pacific stage length as we revamped Australia flying and transitioned our unprofitable shorter haul intra-Asia flying to our joint venture partner ANA. This change in our Pacific flying although earnings accretive drove approximately 2.5 points of unit revenue headwind; third, declining fuel service charges particularly in Japan drove more than 2 points of Pacific PRASM pressure in the quarter. Finally, some [credited] capacity additions in China continued in the first quarter and accounted for 1.5 points of unit revenue degradation.","Turning to corporate revenue, in the first quarter, our corporate portfolio decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year, as our oil related corporate customers began to reduce their flying. On a year-over-year basis, the revenue from our corporate energy accounts declined approximately 20%. Excluding energy, the remaining corporate revenue portfolio increased 1% year-over-year with strength coming primarily from the healthcare sector.","Ancillary revenue continued to grow in the first quarter, averaging more than $23 per passenger an 8.6% increase year-over-year. Economy plus pricing optimization continues to be a leading contributor to our ancillary revenue performance. Quite simply, our customers value and are willing to pay for the extra space and comfort of our economy plus seats. In the first quarter, our economy plus revenue for available economy plus seat was up 16% compared to the first quarter of last year. In the second quarter we expect our unit revenue to decline 4% to 6% with capacity up 2.25% to 3.25%. Based on our current projections, we believe that the second quarter will produce a lowest unit revenue performance of the year.","For the second quarter, we anticipate domestic PRASM will be down approximately 3% and international down approximately 7%. There are three primary contributors to the unit revenue weakness that together will pressure our second quarter PRASM performance by 5.5 points; first, the earnings accretive improvements we have made to the United\u2019s network [indiscernible] that are PRASM dilutive contribute 1 point of PRASM pressure; second, there are external factors driving 3.5 points of pressure which consist primarily of the strong U.S. dollar, lower oil prices and 0.5 point headwind from the timing of Easter; third, competitive capacity and pricing pressures are generating approximately 1 point of unit revenue decline. I will walk you through each of these in greater detail and describe the actions we are taking. First we've made a number of network and fleet improvements including several that reduce cost and expand margins but aren't a drag on unit revenue. These improvements include the installation of slimline seats, the extension of our stage lengths and the consolidation of [slimline] seats, which in total we expect to drive 1 point of year revenue decline.","As an example we've installed slimline seats on 386 aircrafts to date and expect to have 485 completed by year end. These slimline seats improve fuel efficiency, generate very low marginal non-fuel chasm and are highly accretive to earnings. However the additional seats create a headwind to PRASM, as they generate lower than average yields. We remain committed to these network and fleet modifications despite the unit revenue pressure they provide, as they generate significant cost benefits, are accretive to our margins and will improve our operational reliability. ","Second, external factors are also contributing to our expected second quarter revenue performance; we expect that the strong U.S. dollar will contribute one in a quarter point of consolidated unit revenue decline. We anticipate that as we move into the summer U.S. point of sale will increase and offset some of this projected weakness. This will be more pronounced on the Atlantic entity as we expect American consumers will take advantage of the strong dollar and take European vacations. Where we don't anticipate a point of sale shift we will benefit from capacity adjustments we are making through our network. In the second quarter we will benefit from an 11% reduction in Japan capacity and a 13% reduction in our Canadian capacity to offset the weakening currencies in those countries. We will continue to monitor ongoing capacity reductions into the winter months to address continued foreign exchange pressure. Our current expectation is to reduce Japan capacity in the fourth quarter by 7% year-over-year. Declining oil prices are also affecting unit revenue. As I mentioned earlier many international surcharges throughout the world but primarily in the Pacific have decreased as result of lower oil prices. In the second quarter we expect the average surcharge to decline compared to the first quarter and contribute approximately 1 point of year-over-year PRASM pressure to the consolidated network.","Where demand permits we have increased base fares to offset a portion of this headwind. Additionally, the Japan capacity reduction I mentioned earlier will help offset the surcharge reduction. We don\u2019t anticipate these actions can completely close the gap but they should mitigate some of the effect. Lower oil prices are also causing energy related corporate customers to scale back their travel budgets. We expect this to reduce consolidated unit revenue by approximately three-quarters of a point in the second quarter. We are working closely with our corporate customers to address their travel needs and we have begun taking appropriate capacity reductions in several energy centric markets to address their declining performance. Coming into the summer we plan to reduce capacity in these markets by 6 percentage points compared to our original expectation. We will continue to closely evaluate the performance in these markets and are prepared to make additional changes if necessary. ","The third contribute to our unit revenue decline is the competitive capacity and pricing pressure we are confronting. With respect to competitive capacity in the second quarter our routes will face 6% competitive seat growth, this growth will come largely in China, the transatlantic market and Hawaii. We anticipate this will provide a 1 point headwind to PRASM. We expect that this competitive pressure combined with the external factors and margin accretive actions we are taking will put a toll of 5.5 points of pressure by consolidated unit revenue in the second quarter. With respect to capacity, today we lowered our full year guidance by half a point to 1% to 2% year-over-year. With this level of capacity we can accomplish our goals of durable, margin accretive growth while also addressing the pressure points that we just discussed.","In conclusion we are pleased with the progress we have made to expand our revenue premium over the last few quarters. The current environment has brought new challenges and we will continue to manage our network as we have for several years with discipline. With that I'll turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Hart","Thanks Jim. I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our employees for their great work in the first quarter. It was a challenging quarter and a tough winter but our operation performance improved as a result of their professionalism and their dedication. As Jeff mentioned in the first quarter we faced record cold and had more snow days and more de-icing events than the first quarter of last year, the year of the polar vortex. Despite these challenging conditions our operational performance improved year-over-year. One area of keen focus for United has been our express operation. In the first quarter our express completion factor improved by almost 5 points compared to last year. Our mainline operation also had a strong quarter with on-time performance increasing by 1.5 points year-over-year and in February we had the fewest cancellations of any major carries despite having four northern hubs.","Much of this improvement is due to process changes and the investments we made to improve how we manage through and recover from the regular operations. For example, in late January we experienced a significant snow event at our north hub using our new [crew solver] software we were able to quickly and efficiently redeploy our flight crews after the storm resulted in a quicker recovery for customers and employees. On the following day our on-time departure performance was at least 6 percentage points better than we would have achieved last year. Additionally, we had a best express recovery day in the United\u2019s history. Proactive planning and the great work of our employees combined with new software and other technology solutions all helped us to improve our operations in the first quarter. While I am pleased with our progress, we continue to take actions to improve our reliability.","And now I will turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks Greg. And thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. I\u2019d also like to take this opportunity to thank our employees. The progress we made this quarter demonstrates their commitment to improve the United. With their continued support I know we can carry this momentum into the future.","Today, we reported our highest ever first quarter pretax profit of $585 million and grew our earnings per share by $2.85. We increased our trailing 12 month return on invested capital to 17.1% and generated over $1 billion in free cash flow. Both our earnings and free cash flow represent $1 billion improvement over the first quarter of last year. I am pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made but even more excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us.","First quarter consolidated chasm excluding fuel, profit sharing and third party business expense decreased 1.5% year-over-year once again demonstrating the great progress we were making in reducing cost, becoming more efficient and improving the operation. We continue to make solid progress in executing our project quality efficiency initiatives including continued productivity improvements. In the first quarter productivity improved 2% year-over-year marking our seventh consecutive quarter of improved productivity. We also benefited from strengthening dollar which drove approximately 0.5 points of unit cost improvement.","Looking to the second quarter, we expect consolidated chasm again excluding fuel, profit sharing and third party business expense to be up a 0.25% to 1.25% year-over-year. Our full year guidance remains unchanged as we continue to expect non-fuel chasm to be between flat and up 1% versus 2014 despite reducing our full year capacity guidance by 0.5 percentage point. Project Quality continues to be key to achieving our cost goals. In 2015 we expect to achieve $800 million in non-fuel savings from these initiatives and we expect productivity to improve by approximately 3% for the full year.","Turning to fuel expense, we recorded approximately $200 million hedge loss in the quarter which includes approximately $10 million from second quarter positions closed out during the first quarter. We are now 11% hedged for the second quarter and based on the April 16th fuel curve expect to incur at approximately $109 million in hedge losses while participating in 93% of any future price declines. For the second half of 2015, our current hedge book is in a loss position of approximately $340 million and allows us to participate in 79% of any decline in oil prices.","Based on our guidance, we expect our pretax margin to be between 12% and 14% in the second quarter and expect to generate significant free cash flow again. We plan to utilize this cash in a balanced fashion; to buy back stock, pay down debt, accelerate funding of our pension and make appropriate investments in our business. In the first quarter we returned $200 million to shareholders through our repurchase program and we have now completed $520 million of our $1 billion program. Our current expectation is that we will complete the share buyback program in 2015.","We continue to make good progress in de-levering our balance sheet. In the first quarter we made $320 million of debt and capital lease payments including prepayment of approximately $120 million and also announced our intention to prepay $600 million of 6% notes in the second quarter. By May 1st we will have prepaid approximately $750 million of debt year-to-date generating $40 million in annual interest expense savings. In addition, in the first quarter, we contributed $180 million to our pension plans and now expect to fund approximately $700 million in 2015 well in excess of minimum funding requirements.","Our capital expenditures for the first quarter were $794 million and we continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be between $3 billion and $3.2 billion. In the quarter we took delivery of 12 mainline aircraft consisting of nine Boeing 737 900 ERs and three Boeing 787-9s. We also introduced 12 more new 76 seat E175s in service. In addition, this morning we announced several refinements to our fleet plan which will further our efforts to achieve our long term capacity goals of being disciplined with our capital investment.","We have discussed for some time our need to reduce our dependence on 50 seat RJs and to do it in a capital disciplined manner. We are in final negotiations to lease between 10 and 20 used narrow bodied aircrafts which we will take delivery of over the next years. These aircrafts require only modest reconfigurations in order to be common with our current fleet. Additionally, we are extending the useful life of 11 more of our 767-300 ER aircrafts which are in addition to the 10 we previously announced.","By adding an all new interior which will include new Y-class seats, state of the art entertainment system with WiFi, winglets and modifications to improve aircraft reliability, we expect these aircrafts to continue to be productive for years to come. Importantly, these fleet changes allow us to reduce our reliance on 50 seat RJs from approximately 8% of our ASMs at the beginning of last year to about 4% by the end of next year, and finally we signed an agreement with Boeing to substitute 10 787s for 10 777-300ERs without any material change to our capital spending. The increased gauge of the 777-300ER will allow us to better serve certain high demand markets and will integrate seamlessly with our existing 777 fleet. These decisions are significant steps in achieving our long term capacity plans including the elimination of a significant portion of our 50 seat fleet.","In conclusion, I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter, we've demonstrated great progress for four consecutive quarters and are executing against our plan to continue to increase shareholder value. We will take the appropriate actions required to expand earnings, grow margins, generate free cash flow, return cash to shareholders and increase our return on invested capital. I will now turn it over to Jonathan to open up the call for questions.","Jonathan Ireland","Thank you John, first we'll take questions from the analysts' community, then we'll take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow up question. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you sir, [Operator Instructions] please hold for a moment while we assemble our queue. And from Stifel we have Joe DeNardi on line, please go ahead.","Q - Joe DeNardi ","On the fleet changes you guys announced the transitioning of some of the wide bodies under the domestic entity, can you just, I understand you're looking to pull down some international capacity but can you just walk through how that impacts kind of the domestic capacity trends over the next few years?","John Rainey","Hey Joe this is John. I sense that the main question out there is there fuels domestic capacity growth or not, and the answer is no, it doesn't. What this is going to allow us to do, it's going to permit us to reduce frequencies and increase gauge which is part of our network optimization plan. So this is a seat neutral initiative that we're doing here. Let me give you an example of where we fly high frequencies in our hub to hub and markets, take the example of San Francisco to O'Hare. Within 90 minutes on the late flights of the night, Red Eyes, we fly three narrow body aircraft. This is going to allow us to consolidate frequency to use that 777 in that market.","Jeff Smisek","And I'll tie it to John's comment where he on numerous times mentioned removing our reliance on 50 seat regional jets, these narrow bodies then we'll be able to free up and do exactly that, is move, as our 50 seat reliance as we move away from that. It generates the narrow bodies to cover that, so there's a cascading effect to it, so in general, it really promotes more cost efficient flying while serving the demand that's out there.","John Rainey","Joe, I would just add, this is John, and this is bigger picture all part of our plan to utilize the assets that we have more efficiently and to improve our return on invested capital so that we can deploy capital in a manner that best creates shareholder value.","Joe DeNardi ","Okay, that's helpful, and then John, I feel like there have been a number of changes since you guys talked about Project Quality, that are impacting the cost structure a bit with the fleet changes here. Can you just talk about how some of those initiatives are going and what impact that these fleet changes are having on Project Quality and whether the better than expected performance continues into next year?","John Rainey","Sure, and you're probably alluding to the fact that half of our Project Quality savings are in fuel savings. And we have a goal of becoming about $1 billion more efficient in fuel by 2017 and certainly today's fuel prices impacted that and on the margin some of these decisions whether it's taking delivery of used narrow body aircraft, that are maybe less efficient or extending the life of some of the older planes that we have, they will have some impact but the progress that we\u2019ve seen to date in the fuel efficiency line with Project Quality we're very pleased with. We expect to achieve about $500 million this year out of our Project Quality fuel savings initiative and so that's all based on really the tracks from our overall goal.","Operator","From JP Morgan we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Thoughts on LaGuardia parameter rule and the impact on PS out of JFK, also wondering if this ties to the domestic wide body phenomenon, you clearly have the aircraft required for Transcom out of LaGuardia on 7,000 foot runway. But the facilities there are lacking in my opinion [the lounge is air side and obviously -- excuse me, land side and obviously your slot portfolio isn\u2019t quite as rich as Delta or Americans. Does this tie together and what are your aggregate thoughts on this topic?","Jeff Smisek","This is Jeff; let me take a crack at that. The parameter rule has been in place I think for something like 60 years it\u2019s worked pretty well as is. We\u2019re certainly consulting with the port authority about what their thoughts are and our thoughts and then different carriers have different views on that. As for operations in JFK I don\u2019t think really at this point we want to comment on that.","Jim Compton","And Jamie I would add, this is Jim here, our Transcom product continues to improve and perform very well across all the ports there so we\u2019re excited about the product that we\u2019re bringing in and what we can do in that market across our network.","Jamie Baker","And then follow up, question probably for Greg, as we think longer term about the ramifications of potentially pursuing more of a used aircraft strategy, I think Delta would argue one reason of their strategy has been successful that they have this sufficient Tech Ops in place that one really needs to support a somewhat older fleet. Is there a corresponding investment in maintenance for United that we should think about modeling as it relates to this strategy or do you have the systems and people in place and I realized we\u2019re only talking 10 to 20 shelves for now I am just trying to think a little bit longer term?","Greg Hart","I think we\u2019re particularly well positioned to be able to manage any used aircraft we bring on market or into the market with our facility in San Francisco which are; we think are some of the best in the world and the services we provide there. So I think we\u2019re very well positioned and it is well a lot of what the aircraft we\u2019re looking at are actually similar vintage than what we already have in our fleet today.","Operator","From Credit Suisse we have Julie Yates on the line. Please go ahead.","Julie Yates","Q1 was very strong quarter for free cash flow, those were $1 billion, but only $700 million looks seasoned deployed for debt pension and buybacks and I assume that free cash continues to improve in Q2 and Q3. John you mentioned balanced deployment but can you offer more color on the cadence of that deployments between the different opportunities and why we aren\u2019t seeing more buyback especially with year-to-date stock performance?","John Rainey","Certainly Julie, we\u2019ve talked for some time about our need to continue to de-lever and we\u2019ve set some intermediate targets out there of gross debt goals in the neighborhood of $15 billion. The steps that we took to prepay the debt that thus far this year as we\u2019ve announced will help achieve some of that. I do firmly believe that there is significant shareholder value opportunity with de-levering our balance sheet. We are too heavily levered today and it\u2019s a vestige from an industry which is -- we\u2019re not operating in it anymore, it\u2019s much more reformed industry.","As we look at the opportunities that we have to de-lever we don\u2019t have a lot of other options to prepay debt where it make sense say for the secured debt that we have the term loan facility of about $1.3 billion. So as we begin to pick off these pieces of debt like the 6% notes there are less opportunities to prepay that and you will see us probably gear more towards returning cash to shareholders at that point.","Julie Yates","And then just on the pension is there a benefit to expense from the higher discretionary contributions?","John Rainey","There is, and we treat pension just like debt and we\u2019ll continue to fund that appropriate. We\u2019re in situation today where in a low interest rate environment we want to be careful about being in a position where we could actually fund ourselves having an over [firm] pension where you\u2019re not getting the good return on that cash. So, we\u2019ll be primitive with respect to how much we fund there.","Julie Yates","And then just lastly can you offer any update in terms of what amount of the CapEx for this year you tend to finance?","John Rainey","It\u2019s a good question and typically what we\u2019ve done if you look at our CapEx profile this year about $3 billion to $3.2 billion, about two thirds of that is aircraft. And in the past we tended to lever up and borrow most of the amount of that for aircrafts. To your earlier question about limited opportunities to prepaid debt. If we\u2019re in situation where we\u2019re generating a net free cash flow the next best opportunity to de-lever is actually not borrowing incremental money for new aircraft. And so that\u2019s not a decision that we\u2019ve made yet and we\u2019ll wait to see how cash flow is paying out for the year. But it\u2019s reasonable to expect that going forward we will borrow less money for aircraft and spend more cash up-front.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank we have Michael Linenberg on line. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Two questions here, if I could, firstly John. John I want to make sure I heard you correctly I think you indicated that you were going to prefund the pension by 700 million this year?","John Rainey","That's correct.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, so, I don't think you've put out your annual yet but just based on where the deficit was, plus the 700 million this year, it sounds like you're actually pretty close to removing the underfunding, we could be a year or so away from that is that right?","John Rainey","Well, that's fairly close, at the end of the first quarter we\u2019ve got an unfunded liability position about $2.5 billion. And what I was alluding to earlier you could actually find yourself in a situation where if you close that entire gap and then interest rates were to rise again that reduces the projected benefit obligations so you could actually be in a situation where you have an overfunded pension and that's not necessarily the best use of that capital, so we're very thoughtful about the amount that we're going to fund so that we can get close to fully funded but not be in a situation where we'd be overfunded.","Michael Linenberg","Perfect and just my second question to Jim, on the 777s, the ones that are being redeployed to domestic, appreciate the example that you provided, I mean the way we should interpret that or think about that airplane, is it you know going to be utilized hub to hub flying or Hawaii is that going to be the primary use if those airplanes come back into the domestic?","Jim Compton","Hey Michael, this is Jim and you hit it right on the hub. It'll support us in frequency consolidation hub to hub and also support our Hawaii and so that's exactly right.","Operator","From Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay on the line, please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","It's a question John on, looks like your ancillary business expense guidance ticked up at about a $100 million incrementally in the back half of the year. Is there any revenue attached to this and if not come the chasm mix fuel guide did not come down from the prior guide, it even went a little lower capacity and given how Project Quality is going I would think that that would sort of lead to a reduction in the full year chasm mix fuel guide, unless again this is a new initiative and there's some other revenue I can put in the model in the back half.","John Rainey","That's an insightful observation Hunter; we do have in that guidance an assumption about resuming some of the third party sales we've done for fuel. Just this quarter alone you know it's about a $130 million variance from the previous year so to the extent that we got increase of the revenues in and we have more or less in all setting expenses. It's a profitable business but its pretty low margin.","Hunter Keay","Right, okay, that's good and then, I think one of the things that I'm concerned about and I think I'm hearing this from an increasing basis from some investors is that big airports continue to get more service and the smaller mid-sized airports continue to get less and Jim you touched on some of the competitive capacity growth causing some pricing headwind for you guys in 2Q, you're not alone, everybody has competitive capacity growth in the markets and you're putting 777s in big airport that's going to theoretically I think exacerbate, that probably forward, so is there anything that you guys can tell us now, why we should not being concerned about -- even though the headline number on capacity continues to sort of trend better on the increment, the competitive capacity trends appear to be getting worse so how do we feel good about United's ability to sort of compete in that environment as the biggest airports are getting more and more competitive?","Jim Compton","Hey Hunter, this is Jim. That's a great question, obviously I'll speak from United's perspective and how we think about this, but the base of it is that we are really committed to a disciplined capacity approach, so even the 777 that I talked about, it will be seat neutral and we'll manage that capacity discipline. You know as a matter of fact over the last eight years United's grown its capacity at GDP or less for every year and so that's really the strong part of our plan that we feel allows us to grow our margins and reinvest in our business and so continue to do that.","There's an examples as we've done that, what's the test of that, we lowered our guidance to 0.5 point this year from 1.5 to 2.5 guidance from 1 to 2. A lot of the work we're doing to offset and mitigate some of the foreign exchange has been in place in the first quarter, our Japan capacity was down 11% year-over-year so it gets back to that general principle of always staying disciplined and allowing us to be flexible to move with what\u2019s happening in the market places and the demand. So from United's perspective there's nothing about what we've been doing over the last several years that's going to change going forward. There's a change in how we're approaching capacity, the capacity that we're adding is really efficient and so when I talk about the slimline seats and that's going to grow our capacity growth of 2% in the domestic space in the second quarter, is that efficient slimline capacity growth comes in a lower average yield which drives pricing down, but it\u2019s very cost effective and margin accretive. So our commitments to that and we're going to continue to do that.","Hunter Keay","Thank you John and Jim.","Operator","From Cowen and Company we have Helane Becker online, please go ahead.","Helane Becker","This maybe a question for Jeff. You are now the second largest US airline and you're not included in the S&P yet, and I'm just kind of wondering if you think about that at all, if it's a priority and if you do think about getting included is there stuff you can do to perhaps move the process along?","Jeff Smisek","Helane, I think about that every night right before I go to bed.","Helane Becker","I hope that\u2019s not true.","Jeff Smisek","I am a really boring guy. Yes it is something that we do think about, it is something that we think is appropriate and as for anything we can do to get there that I\u2019ll turn over to with John.","John Rainey","Halena, we meet the qualifications today to -- for inclusion in the S&P500 there is not anything, there is not anything that we can do to get them to be more interested in us I think part of it is you\u2019ve got to have someone meet the S&P500 to actually being included. So, it\u2019s something that I think would help our stock long term having a fund in us like that and something that we certainly desire but it\u2019s largely outside of our control.","Helane Becker","And then can I just ask a labor related question, I think you still got a couple of contracts that aren\u2019t -- don\u2019t have merged seniority list. Can you do an update for us on where that stands?","Jeff Smisek","First of all, we\u2019ve gotten contracts with -- we've got 28 out of our 30 contracts to get done, so we only have two left. So those are with our technicians and with our flight attendants. We\u2019re in negotiations with both groups. I won\u2019t comment on the negotiation themselves, but I\u2019ll tell you we very much would desire to getting those done. We believe that our employee groups wish to get them done but we have to approach that in an appropriate disciplined manner to reach agreements that are good for the company and good for the employees.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley we have William Greene on line. Please go ahead.","William Greene","Jim, I am wondering if you can clarify one point on some of the PRASM commentary, you talked about second quarter being the trough and so obviously things will get better. Do you feel like that\u2019s more on balance capacity statement or is it more on balance of demand statement? Do you have enough visibility into the back half to understand sort of what demand looks like or is it really just the capacity from this or even comps I guess could be the other right answer too?","Jim Compton","From a PRASM point of view, as you -- second quarter being the low point is driven by many of the things I talked about on the call. The largest effect for instance, fuel surcharges in Japan [hitting] us in the second quarter. And as you go through the year and particularly through the fourth quarter you begin to kind of mitigate some of that just on a year-over-year basis. On the -- some of it is just the seasonality, seasonal shaping that was really successful in the quarter, particularly in the Trans-Atlantic. We planned obviously to grow that capacity as we move into the summer strong periods and take advantage of the higher RASM in the summer period through for instance Trans-Atlantic.","So it\u2019s a combination of some of the effects year-over-year kind of balancing it out tied with the initiatives that we are doing to reduce our capacity and some of the oil related markets as well as for instance in the Trans-Atlantic will be flat to down year-over-year in the fourth quarter now which drives our guidance reducing it by 0.5 point to 1 point to 2 point. So, those things that market basket of things kind of makes the second quarter the low watermark based on what we see today.","William Greene","John I wanted to follow up one question for you on fuel, so obviously we\u2019re redoing the hedge book and we\u2019ll participate in lot of the downside. When you think about deployment of cash, do you think at all about trying to lock in longer term some of the current fuel prices in any way or is that just not a part of the use of cash?","John Rainey","It\u2019s a good question Bill and it\u2019s absolutely when we look at four projections for earnings today at the fuel prices that you see today, which arguably are lower than the long term average. We absolutely think about protecting some of that because the opportunities that we have to improve our business with the type of cash flow that we can generate are huge and so spending a little bit of money to protect against any pop in oil prices is something that we will likely do as we look at opportunities we\u2019re more focused on 2016 than \u201915 at this point, but I think that\u2019s a reasonable use of cash given what we can do with the cash flows in terms of improving shareholder value.","Operator","From Barclays we have David Fintzen on the line. Please go ahead.","David Fintzen","Just a question for Jim and you alluded to I know you mentioned sort of point of sales start to shift into the summer. Just given the speed and sort of historic degree of the year and the move in the euro, is there a different dynamic in point of sale shift into the summer than maybe you\u2019ve seen in the past where you\u2019ve kind of clean up a lot of it with U.S. [20] sales, so how is that trending, is it sort of different this time?","Jim Compton","There is a general shift deployment now to the U.S. side that head -- as you head into the summer. We do think that given the exchange rate and the strength of the dollar that we'll see that accelerate this year, and quite frankly in our bookings we are already starting to see some of that, so, some of that foreign exchange impact that's affecting us in the transatlantic will thus be offset by an even stronger point on sale of the US and the transatlantic since we're head into the summer. So we're beginning to see those trends happen, they're above and above the rate that they normally do.","David Fintzen","Okay, sort of more 3Q than 2Q is what you're alluding that one?","Jim Compton","Yes, absolutely, you know most of our, even our seasonal shaping of capacity was meant to hit kind of the June through August period, but we've really above the lines with seasonal shaping, the Trans-Atlantic that we set out for this year.","David Fintzen","Okay and then just on a sort of similar topic, the Euro hedge, if you didn't have that hedge in the second quarter what would the incremental FX hit be and then how does that run off through the course of the year?","Jim Compton","It's not a huge amount, we're hedged 47% for the balance of the year at around 1.22-1.23, and so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s big of a number for the second quarter. I don\u2019t have the specific number that you've asked off the top of my head, but I don't believe its material, so I'm thinking through it.","David Fintzen","Okay, all right, that's helpful and one quick one just to the energy related comment, on travel demand. The way I kind of interpret, is that predominantly international travel that's energy related that you're seeing or are you seeing sort of a broader Houston impact?","Jim Compton","It's both of those, the energy travel going to a couple of interesting, is that it really flies, when it flies internationally it flies in business class, and so a big portion of that revenue is international because of that. But even in Houston a data point, is that we saw our Houston [rising] in the first quarter, down 5% and our consolidated PRASM was up 0.4, so that gives you a little contest that, yes it is -- a lot of that oil traffic is international. But it also affects the domestic and we're adjusting some of that domestic capacity for instance to North Dakota and Canada to address some of the demand issues that are associated with that.","Operator","From Evercore ISI we have Duane Pfennigwerth on the line, please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Just two questions from me, to what extent did pilot availability factor into your decision to accelerate some of these regional fleet changes, and wonder if you can offer any comment on your partners' ability to fly the schedule the schedule that you want them to fly.","Jeff Smisek","This is Jeff; I'll talk a little bit about that. Pilot availability clearly, particularly for the 50 seat operation is an issue for us which does indeed affect the availability of our express operators to fly the scheduled, and moreover the 50 seat product is something that is not as good a product as the 76 seaters, for example the new Imperio 175s that are in the market [indiscernible] product with considered very attractive airplane, very comfortable airplane has WiFi, has putting first class food up front, has a better ancillary revenue opportunities, and confortable seats and is a very good product. But the shift of the pilots, our reduction in availability of pilots for smaller airplanes is clearly affecting us, as in it's affecting all of our competitors who operate the [program].","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks Jeff, and then just on seasonality of free cash flow generation, strong number here in the first quarter earnings seasonally stronger in second quarter, but is it fair to assume that free cash flow generation will actually be higher sequentially in 2Q and thanks for taking the questions.","Greg Hart","It's fair to assume that Duane, a lot depends upon earnings, but to your point we tend to build a lot more cash in the first and second quarters and we expect very strong cash generation there. We have a goal being free cash flow positive in every quarter and giving the earnings profile of this business, that's not an unreasonable assumption.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Is that something you think you could hit this year potentially.","Greg Hart","Again it depends upon your earnings assumption, but yes potentially.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","We've time for one final question, from Buckingham Research we have Dan McKenzie online, please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Apologies for yet another 777 question but I can't resist and I guess I'm just wondering if the move is potential prelude to adding a fourth cabin domestically and how should we think about the pros and cons of that kind of a strategy?","Jim Compton","Dan, this is Jim, we have no plans to add a fourth cabin domestically, given what we\u2019re doing, ancillary revenue particularly with the economy plus, we actually we're really early in the game of driving as sort of the revenue with that product today, so we're going to kind of -- we\u2019re going to continue to build on that and so the answer would be no.","Dan McKenzie","Okay, very good. You know John, I guess just following up on the free cash flow commentary obviously you\u2019re completing the share repurchase well ahead of schedule here and I believe investors are concluding that United may not actually announce another capital return program this year but -- and I guess I am wondering if we should preclude that possibility I mean what\u2019s the right way to think about expectations here?","Jim Compton","I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that as we conclude our existing share repurchase program that we\u2019ll be in the market with something additional whether it\u2019d be a share repurchase, dividend whatever we think is the best way to return cash to shareholders at that point in time.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media [Operator Instructions]. From Thomson Reuters we have Jeffrey Dastin on line. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Dastin","How does the 747 fits into United\u2019s fleet --planned fleet, retirement plan in 2015 and how do you only considered retiring a significant portion of 747s going forward?","John Rainey","The 747 is something that we do intend to keep for a few more years we have a couple coming out of our fleet in the near future but some of these we\u2019ve made some improvements to the operating reliability of the aircraft and we could expect to keep them for another few years. They have another sort of big maintenance events in the 2020 time frame that that will be another decision point for us whether we want to extend them further at that point or go ahead and retire them.","Jeffrey Dastin","And just a separate fleet related question, so with which model of Dreamliner did United exchange for the 777s and might United elaborate on what discount they may have received for them?","John Rainey","We have not disclosed which model we substituted and we might not elaborate of the discount, that\u2019s something we\u2019d like to keep between us and Boeing.","Operator","From The Street we have Ted Reed on line. Please go ahead.","Ted Reed","I don\u2019t quite understand why you\u2019re trading in 787 orders for 777 orders. I thought the 787 orders were big advantage for United. So I\u2019d like to know why you\u2019re doing it apart from price and give me an example of where it would benefit you.","John Rainey","We\u2019re still a big believer in the 787, it\u2019s a greater best in our fleet today. The 777-300ER is also a very good aircraft and happens to have the best reliability of any plane in the sky today. It also has -- we have an opportunity to put that in some markets that it\u2019s a better aircraft and with the 787 or some of our other existing planes out there today. So this is all part of normal fleet planning that we do from time-to-time and there is nothing to read into this about the 787.","Ted Reed","Can you give me an example of a route that it might be better than -- that the 777 might be better?","John Rainey","I won\u2019t give you a specifically route, but clearly it integrates well with the 777 we fly to New York, it allows us to up gauge New York, which has always been a strategy of ours given the constraints there and the demand that we\u2019re seeing in New York with the hub and how it\u2019s working in New York. So that\u2019s a great aircraft to up gauge in New York with that 777-300.","Ted Reed","And one other thing Delta say that it would cut international capacity growth in fourth quarter by 3%, I can\u2019t quite figure out from you said is that about what you\u2019re doing. I know you have some big cuts in Japan, but can you compare it to Delta?","Jeff Smisek","We haven\u2019t disclosed what the fourth quarter in terms of international in total, we are bringing our Atlanta capacity to flat to down year-over-year. Again for us we\u2019ve been very much focused on capacity discipline. So, our Japan capacity for instance in the first quarter was down 11% it\u2019s already planned to be down 7% in the fourth quarter. So, we\u2019ve been ahead of this as we create the flexibility in our fleet plan to match capacity and demand.","Operator","And we have time for one final question from Flightglobal, we have Edward Russell on line. Please go ahead.","Edward Russell","I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on the time line of the 777-200s coming into the domestic fleet.","Jeff Smisek","It won\u2019t be this year.","Nene Foxhall","With that, we\u2019re out of time and we\u2019ll conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call media relations if you have further questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"21225":["United Continental Holdings, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call maybe recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.","I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mike Leskinen, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations.","Mike Leskinen","Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning, everyone and welcome to United's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning we issued a presentation accompanying this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com.","Information in yesterday's release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and our remarks made during the conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, investor update and presentation, copies of which are available on our website.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. In addition, we have other members of the team in the room available to assist with Q&A.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Mike and my thanks to all of you for joining us today. With the tailwind of an outstanding 2018 at our back United came right out of the gate in the first quarter of 2019 with strong unit revenue growth, effective cost management, and a second consecutive quarter of adjusted pre-tax margin expansion, an emerging trend we expect to continue. Now running an efficient airline is precisely what has allowed us to make a series of industry-leading investments this quarter that are increasingly making United the airline people choose to fly.","But first, let's turn to slide 4. As the financial results this quarter affirm, clearly our strategy is working. First quarter adjusted pre-tax earnings were $389 million with an adjusted pre-tax margin of 4.1%, an increase of more than 200 basis points year-over-year, and the best first quarter we've had in three years. We more than doubled our first quarter earnings per share year-over-year. So this puts us well on track to achieve our 2019 adjusted EPS targets of $10 to $12 and gives us confidence that we will meet, or exceed our 2020 adjusted EPS goals.","From an operational perspective, this was not an easy quarter especially when we consider the harsh winter weather, the MAX grounding, and several other events that Greg will cover later. So I want to thank our employees for their hard work and demonstrating once again the proof not promises mentality you've heard us talk so much about.","By combining this impressive operational performance and making smart investments in customer service, we've been able to elevate our customers experience in tangible ways, while strategically managing our costs. Here are just a few examples of the customer benefits we unveiled in the last few months.","First, we made the United app even better. We debut a new version of the most downloaded airline app in the world by making it more intuitive and a more personalized resource for our customers.","Second, more than 100 channels of live television are now free for every customer in every class of service on more than 200 United aircraft.","Third, on the fleet, we announced the two-cabin 50-seat Bombardier CRJ-550 aircraft. When it is launched later this year, it will be a game changer for regional flying for our offering of first-class cabin, Economy Plus seating, WiFi and more amenities that any other 50-seat regional aircraft offering today.","This regional aircraft innovation will benefit in particular our customers in spoke cities, who can enjoy more consistent product when connecting through our hubs to travel internationally. In addition, we announced a significant expansion of our premium offering by adding an additional 1,600 United Polaris business class and United first seats, which means more than 100 United aircraft will see a premium capacity increase by 50% or more.","Fourth, we continue to grow our network to better serve our customers. We announced earlier this week that United is returning to Africa applying to wide service between Newark\/New York and Cape Town, South Africa. And last month, we unveiled our plan to ramp-up our service to Asia and launched six daily non-stop flights to Tokyo Haneda Airport.","Our success this quarter demonstrates our strategy to grow our airline, invest in our customer service and effectively manage our costs is working. And it's inspiring our workforce, it's winning over our customers, and it's delivering for our investors. Our momentum is fully starting to build and our future is really as bright as ever.","So, now let me hand it over to Scott for his take on the quarter and to discuss several uniquely United opportunities that we'll be rolling immediately, but over the long-term will have a significant and positive impact on our airline and our customers. These opportunities have bigger upside potential for us than any of our competitors and we're determined to make the most of it. Scott?","Scott Kirby","Thanks, Oscar. It's great to have everyone on the call today. We started 2019 with fantastic momentum here at United. While we faced some external headwinds this quarter, our team did an exceptional job covering the operation and minimizing the impact on our customers, while still achieving earnings above midpoint of our adjusted pre-tax margin guidance. Given the extraordinary efforts of the United team to care for customers this quarter, Greg is going to take some time to talk more about what the team accomplished operationally.","Last year, we were executing well. And because we faced few external headwinds other than high fuel prices, we were able to raise our adjusted EPS guidance every quarter. We continued executing well this quarter. And even as we faced an unusual number of exogenous events, we remained on track to deliver for both our customers and our shareholders. We believe successfully managing through a more trying quarter like the one we just had is an even better proof point of the strong path United is on. We have a responsibility to overcome adversity without making excuses and we did just that this year \u2013 we did just that last year with higher fuel prices and we're doing the same in 2019.","In the first quarter, we were pleased with our revenue performance and cost management, and expect to lead our peers in year-over-year pre-tax margin expansion. By continuing to run the airline more efficiently, we're able to invest in the business and still effectively manage cost, and we've done just that.","Meeting or exceeding our adjusted earnings per share target is the foundation upon which our strategic plan is built. It's precisely what allows us to invest in our product and improve the customer experience. We're striving to up our game and consistently deliver customer service based on our core four principle safe, caring, dependable and efficient. We continue our commitment to building a culture based on customer centricity. There are backstage events, where over the course of this year, we're gathering all 25,000 of our flight attendants near our headquarters in downtown Chicago. That's 34 separate two-day events with about 800 flight attendants at each one.","In a series of interactive sessions and workshops, our in-flight crews are focusing on the central ethos of caring service, to elevate the way our customers feel about their United experience. A second opportunity, vividly illustrates how we're leveraging technology to deliver on the promise of caring for customers.","We're pioneering the implementation of new technology called dynamic departure, which empowers frontline employees; real-time data they need to make an informed decision on whether to hold a flight for customers rushing to a connecting flight. This technology identifies flights for connecting customers, who will be arriving a little late, where we have the opportunity to make up time in flight, still arrive on time and wait for the connecting customer instead of closing the door and miss connecting them.","We've been testing this in Denver and we expect to save hundreds of connecting customers per day when fully rolled out. Dynamic departure is great at caring for our customers, but it's also another example of how our team is innovating and testing new technology to constantly make United better.","Finally, with respect to our MileagePlus program, we know some of us from prior personal experience that this is one of our single biggest margin growth opportunity, and therefore, one of the company's and my personal top priorities. There are many aspects of the program, we're very proud of. However, it remains true that the co-brand component of our program underperforms relative to our peers, and this disparity only widened after recent announcements.","Fortunately, United has hubs in the largest and highest income cities, which gives United and Chase the most opportunity for a co-brand card anywhere in the world. We're negotiating with Chase on the opportunities for improved economics for our card partnership, to ensure that our deal delivers industry competitive value to all of our stakeholders.","We look forward to moving ahead with these discussions privately, which means we cannot answer questions about the status of our deal with Chase or any related negotiations today.","However, it's worth noting that our full year 2019 and 2020 adjusted EPS guidance does not include any assumptions regarding benefits from a new co-brand agreement, so the current negotiations are only upside to our existing guidance. Our success in the first quarter gives us confidence that we'll continue the momentum of 2018 into 2019, as we move into the second half -- the second year of our strategic plan. While it is nice to be able to raise adjusted EPS guidance the past several quarters in light of the MAX grounding and uncertainty around the duration, we feel it's best to simply affirm our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance at this time.","With this \u2013 that, I'll turn it over to Greg to talk about incredible things the United team did to take care of our customers this quarter.","Greg Hart","Thanks Scott. As Oscar and Scott already mentioned, we faced a number of unexpected events in the quarter. We are particularly proud of the dedication of over 93,000 employees who worked through these challenges and went through extraordinary lengths to care for our customers.","In addition to hub-closing weather events like the polar vortex in Chicago or the winter storm in Denver, we overcame a unique operational event in each month of the quarter. First, we started the quarter off in January with the government shutdown.","Then in February, our flights to India, which represent 1.2% of our capacity were impacted by the closure of the Pakistani airspace. The closure required us to stage crews and refuel in Germany in order to continue operating the flights. The team has worked hard to find a solution for our Mumbai flight. But unfortunately, we have had to suspend the service to Delhi through July 2 in order to minimize the disservice to our customers.","On March 13, the FAA announced a decision to ground the MAX aircraft. We have 14 of this aircraft in our fleet. This represents about 1.4% of our capacity, which means that the grounding has only had a modest operational impact on the airline thus far, but that impact grows the longer the grounding lasts. But we have been focused on caring for those customers whose travel plans were impacted.","We adjusted schedules and even upgauged some routes with 777s or 787s like San Francisco to Maui and Houston to Los Angeles. These solutions costs us money in the short-term, but was clearly the right thing to do for our customers and the right thing to do for the airline over the long-term.","Making these kinds of adjustments gets much harder during the busy summer travel season, when among other things, aircraft utilization and load factors are higher. So yesterday, we announced that we hold the MAX aircraft out of our schedule through early July.","Since no one knows when regulators will complete their review of the MAX, we'll be focused on two priorities. First, we'll continue to take extraordinary steps to care for our customers and mitigate the impact of this change on their travel plans. Second, we'll cooperate fully with the regulators as they conduct their own independent assessment of the aircraft's safety.","For more than 90 years, the safety of our customers and employees at United has come first. That's why we don't -- won't put our customers and employees on that plane until that independent assessment is complete. We take a lot of pride at United in running a great operation. Despite all of the headwinds in the quarter, we ran an operation we can all be proud of. In fact, in our largest hubs with major hub competitors Chicago, Denver and San Francisco we once again ran the best operation of all the hub operators.","These outstanding results are a testament to the hard work of our employees and the airline's ability to be nimble and adjust to an environment that is always changing. The success of our operation enabled the strong revenue results that Andrew will now go into in more detail.","Andrew Nocella","Thanks Greg. The quarter got off to a great start with strong business and leisure demand with PRASM up 1.1% for the period and top line passenger revenue growth of 7.1%. Overall, we're very pleased with our revenue performance given the uncertainties we faced earlier this year. The continued success of our commercial initiatives helped us achieve this strong passenger revenue performance and our ancillary revenues were up 13% or up high teens.","Our best-performing entity for the first quarter was the Pacific. First quarter PRASM increased 4.5%, which was above our early expectations and represents our fourth consecutive quarter of robust PRASM growth. Demand for our flights was strong across the region and we expect continued strong performance for the second quarter albeit at more moderate levels.","Latin America is strong shown in the quarter as well with 2.6% increase in RASM. We expect even stronger performance in the second quarter across most of the region, in part due to the shift of Easter creating a very strong April. Brazil PRASM is also expected to turn positive for the first time since the second quarter of 2018, while Argentina continues to look negative.","We anticipated a challenging first quarter for the Atlantic. PRASM decreased by 2.8% entirely driven by weak main cabin pricing. The front cabin however continued to do well. In the second quarter, we expect a significant inflection in economy cabin yields in May with healthy demand for both cabins. Europe for the quarter looks strong, but due to the Easter shift comps will be difficult in April.","Our domestic PRASM in the quarter increased by 0.6% on a 7.4% increase in capacity. The first quarter will be our highest capacity growth quarter of the year and we're very pleased with the results.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect our consolidated passenger unit revenue to be up 0.5% to 2.5% year-over-year. The unit revenue is in line with our expectations when we set our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance.","Turning to slide 12. We continue to focus on commercial initiatives capitalize on all the opportunities of our network. As Scott mentioned before, we're encouraged by the long-term potential of our co-brand agreement. Close to end, we just posted the strongest first quarter of new card account acquisitions we have seen in the past five years continuing our trend of double-digit quarter-on-quarter growth. But as Scott has already outlined, we remain focused on the future and we're recently reminded of the significant upside that will be available to United as we look forward.","We efficiently flew our first flight on a Premium Plus aircraft to Tokyo in early April. We expect Premium Plus will have a negligible impact on revenues for 2019, but is expected to be far more impactful in 2020 and thereafter when fully filled up. We remain optimistic on the impact as we continue to see average yields for Premium Plus at more than two times of coach yields and paid load factors are expected to be above 70%.","The structural gap we have long been challenged to fill has been our premium seating in smaller communities across the United States. As Oscar mentioned earlier, in the quarter, we announced the introduction of CRJ-550 that is scheduled to join the fleet between this fall and June of 2020 when we focus on short-haul business markets.","Polaris seat installations continue to be on pace to be finished in late 2020 and our sixth planned Polaris lounge at Washington Dulles will open in 2020 as well. We continue to focus on using our RM system Gemini. Yet again, in the first quarter, we held more seats to be billed later in the booking curve.","Saving seats to sell closer to departure date is possible due to the efforts of our sales force. In the quarter, corporate revenues which booked much closer to departure increased 13% well above our top line revenue growth.","As planned our Denver schedule is re-banked this mid-February. The recent capacity we have added leading up to the re-bank in Denver has been absorbed well by the market and successful at the outset. We're optimistic about the changes, which increase connections as well as improve flight timings for our customers. With Denver re-banks we have completed all of our mid-continent hub restructures. And in the first quarter all three hubs posted positive unit revenues and had year-over-year margin expansion.","MileagePlus won the best frequent flyer program award from FlyerTalk. We consider this one to be pretty significant as this award is given to us directly from all flyers. We're committed to winning again next year.","We recently announced that we'll be weighting for the same award booking fees, together with removing the award chart, so we can more accurately match award supply with member demand through dynamic pricing for award redemptions.","As part of our commitment to continuously upgrading our MileagePlus member experience, we now instantly post miles to accounts as soon as a flight pull into the gate. We continue to expand basic economy as well through more flights and more booking classes. We are also experimenting when increasing the buy-up amount from Basic to standard economy. As of now, buy-up rates continue to be stable, even on higher buy-up costs.","Earlier this week, we announced the introduction of service to Cape Town, South Africa for late 2019 and now we're just weeks away from launching Prague, Czech Republic and Naples, Italy. We're thrilled to announce the addition of Africa to our global route offering.","While, we are focused on building our mid-continent activity in the coming years, we remain excited about the international potential of the United network for the long term. The work we're doing to strengthen our domestic network enables the new international routes like the ones I just mentioned.","In closing, we continue to feel really good about the plan we announced in January 2018 is working well. We're on track to achieve the adjusted earnings per share targets we outlined as well as the pre-tax margin expansion in 2019. Thanks to the entire United team for a strong first quarter.","With that, I will turn it over to Gerry to discuss our financial results.","Gerry Laderman","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we released our first quarter 2019 earnings and our second quarter investor update. You can refer to those documents for additional detail. For the highlights, slide 14 is a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 15 shows our non-GAAP adjusted results.","We are pleased to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 for the first quarter, up 135% versus a year ago. Adjusted pre-tax income was $389 million and adjusted pre-tax margin was 4.1%, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year and marking the second consecutive quarter of adjusted pre-tax margin expansion. We are all very proud of these results. Slide 16 shows our total unit cost for the first quarter and our forecast for the second quarter and full year 2019.","Turning to slide 17. Non-fuel unit cost in the first quarter decreased 1.8% on a year-over-year basis. This was a great result, driven by a combination of continued cost discipline, better completion and timing of expenses over the course of the year.","For the second quarter 2019, we expect non-fuel unit cost to be flat to up 1%. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, a CASM headwind we face is driven by the reduced flying, caused by the grounding of the MAX aircraft and temporary suspension of our flights to Delhi, which currently combined represents about 2% of our capacity.","With respect to the MAX, we currently have 17 of the -- we currently have 14 of these aircraft in our fleet, with five more scheduled for delivery in the second quarter and 11 more scheduled for delivery in the third quarter.","While the financial impact of the MAX grounding and temporary suspension of service to Delhi has been modest, the longer these events last the greater the impact on ASMs and CASM. Based on our current assumption that the MAX aircraft will remain out of our schedule until at least early July and our flight to Delhi will remain suspended through July 2, we have reduced our full year capacity guidance to up 4% to 5%.","Due to the changing capacity we've also revised our full year CASM-ex guidance to be around flat year-over-year. Our ability to achieve better-than-flat CASM-ex this year will be negatively impacted if the MAX aircraft remain out of service or flights to Delhi remain suspended longer than our current assumption, but we remain confident in our full year EPS guidance.","As you can see on slide 18, we spent $527 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the first quarter at an average price of $83.68 per share. As of the end of the first quarter we have approximately $1.2 billion left in our repurchase authority and plan to continue to be opportunistic with our share repurchases.","During the quarter, we took delivery of eight new aircraft. We also purchased five mainline aircraft and 16 regional aircraft off-lease. These aircraft purchases, in conjunction with continued investments in the business, drive our 2019 adjusted CapEx outlook of $4.7 billion.","Lastly, slide 19 has a summary of our current guidance, including the second quarter's projected fuel price range using the April 11 curve. The range provided for capacity, revenue and costs implies the second quarter 2019 adjusted pre-tax margin between 11% and 13%. We continue to expect full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be between $10 and $12.","We are pleased with our results in the first quarter of 2019 and remain confident in our ability to continue to execute on our growth plan. We are managing the business to maximize earnings and continue to be focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, Mike will now begin the Q&A.","Mike Leskinen","Thanks, Gerry. First, we'll take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Vanessa, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we have from Stifel, Joe DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joe DeNardi","Yes, yes. Good morning. Scott, you mentioned on earnings call in 2017 that you thought the margin headwind from United's card economics were about 1 point to 1.5 point. Based on Delta's recent deal, it seems like the economics they got may be improved by 10% or so, so that would imply maybe your margin deficit is closer to 2 points now. Would you disagree with that math?","Scott Kirby","So as we said, we think this is a significant opportunity. We're not going to proactively affirm what the number is and the size of the opportunity, but we certainly would disagree with your analysis on the potential opportunity.","Joe DeNardi","Okay. And then, just kind of higher level, Scott, as you think about the earnings potential from the card, United is a little bit -- quite a bit smaller for now at least, in terms of passengers versus Delta and American. So how do we reconcile that with what your card economics could be eventually?","Do you have better card penetration? Is your spend per card higher? Like, why do you guys get market rate economics as a smaller airline? And then, just, Scott, you mentioned that you're in negotiations with Chase now. Is that a change like you're formally in negotiations? Or have you been in negotiations for a little while now? Thank you.","Scott Kirby","Well, firstly, we're not going to talk about the negotiations. We certainly have a lot of tough conversations about Chase to start. Look, first, I think it is fair to describe the opportunity. And while our number of passengers is smaller, if you look at our revenues, it's essentially the same, which is indicative of the fact that United is in the best market with hubs in New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, Houston, Denver, San Francisco and Los Angeles.","I think there's no question that we have the best set of markets and the best potential for cards for total spend. Great markets with high incomes, it is -- they are the premier markets with a premium card demand. And I think there's no question that we have the most potential.","The issue is around realizing that with Chase and we are working hard with them. We are in discussions with them. Those have been ongoing and hopefully got a little bit of octane boost from the recent competitive announcement, but both sides are actively engaged and working hard on a win-win solution that work for Chase that work for United and that gets more customers more and more economics for both of us.","Joe DeNardi","Thanks, Scott.","Scott Kirby","And we really are by the way -- in the future we're going to try to not -- we really don't have anything to add on the card, so we ask to not ask the same questions over and over again please.","Joe DeNardi","Fair enough.","Operator","Thank you. From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker.","Jamie Baker","Oh, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Following up on Gerry's MAX observations, but maybe for Greg, the cancellations to date have been well below those of other U.S. operators, even when adjusting for the fact that your fleet is smaller. Can you walk us through the mechanics a bit? Does it imply you were over-spared to begin with? Was it accomplished just by pushing off nonessential maintenance? What I'm trying to better understand is post-July, how do the potential pressures on margins actually show up?","Greg Hart","Hey, Jamie, this is Greg. Thanks for the question. It was really a combination of things we're able to do to recover the schedule including, we did take a little operational risk in terms of utilizing spares we had. We moved the hangar plans around and deferred some maintenance as well as we changed some of the heavy check schedules on our aircraft. But it was a combination of things. With 14 aircraft that was something that we could manage for a month or two, given some of the flexibility we have in our maintenance plans. But beyond that, it gets really tough to manage, because there are not many maintenance and events that we can preclude doing within the time frame.","Jamie Baker","Sure. Okay. That helps. And second, MAX-related follow-up for whoever would like to take it. As we think about the potential timing of a pilot deal, I would initially assume that the two phenomena are mutually exclusive. But with all the MAX focus both for management and for ALPA is this slowing down the conversation that you'd otherwise be having with your aviators or not?","Scott Kirby","No, it's not. And I would say that ALPA has been a great partner for us on the MAX issue. While we have negotiations, we don't always agree about everything. But it comes to safety here at United that's one where we work hand in glove with ALPA and we appreciate their active involvement in the process so far. But it is not at all hindering or impacting the ongoing negotiations.","Jamie Baker","Cool. Just wanted to check. Greg and Scott, thanks very much.","Scott Kirby","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","And from Vertical Research, we have Darryl Genovesi.","Darryl Genovesi","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the time. Gerry, you had previously talked about flat to down CASMex in both 2019 and 2020. With some of the exogenous issues that you're facing this year and the move to a flat CASM guide, is there any reason why assuming the 737 MAX and your Pakistan issues are cleared up by year-end we shouldn't be thinking about down CASM in 2020?","Gerry Laderman","So Darryl, if everything's cleared up this year, there's no reason that we wouldn't be focused on what we said we would do next year.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Are there any -- I guess what are the big levers that you still have to pull on CASMex? I realize that the capacity growth is helping, particularly during some of the off-peak periods. Are there any other focus initiatives that you would highlight as being the big CASM opportunities for over the next year, 1.5 years to get you to that guide?","Gerry Laderman","I would describe the categories as the same as we've been talking about. There are some for instance gauge, which probably kicks in more next year than this year would be one. Continued efficiency and the use of our assets is another one. But generally, the categories will continue to be the same. It's just better execution.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then could you also just give us a sense of the CapEx trajectory from here?","Gerry Laderman","So we highlighted in the investor update, our schedule for new aircraft deliveries next year, which ties to what was disclosed in our 10-K. Next year is a peak year for wide-body deliveries. We have 17 next year on top of 28 narrow-bodies versus only 10 this year. That does drive incremental CapEx versus this year. It's too early to give you the precise number. But ballpark I can tell you you're looking -- the cost of those wide-bodies is about $1 billion more than this year. That's a peak. We expect wide-body deliveries to come down after that.","We're very focused on making smart decisions on CapEx. An example of how we look at it, take the 777-300ERs that we're taking this year. We expect a first year ROIC on those aircraft in the mid-teens well above our cost of capital. And that only improves as those aircraft depreciate. I'd also highlight that we're focused where we can on mitigating aircraft CapEx between now and the end of next year. We actually have 30 used aircraft coming in. And if you look at what that's saving us versus new aircraft that's $600 million to $700 million of CapEx savings.","So beyond that, I can repeat what we've talked about before, which is this is sort of on an normalized basis replacement of non-aircraft CapEx and kind of growth that are on GDP that's around a $4 billion CapEx number annually. But as we find opportunities to grow -- and like next year, you can see a year like next year where there's a little bit of a spike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Wolfe Research, Hunter Keay.","Hunter Keay","Hey, thanks. Good morning everybody. Just a little bit more about CapEx. I don't want to diminish anything from the CASM progress you've made, but do you have any idea how much the incremental CapEx is going to save you on the P&L for CASMex? And why did that CapEx come up relative to the initial plan on the wide-bodies Gerry? Thanks.","Gerry Laderman","I'd say that it has -- that's been our plan now for a few years. It just happens that next year consistent with the growth plan that we had, it's a -- there's a spike in wide-bodies. But what it allows us to do in addition to the growth that had been planned, it allows us to really redeploy the wide-bodies much more effectively, putting the right aircraft on the right route and also sets us up nicely for the alternate retirement of some of those older aircraft. But keep in mind, these are 30-year assets we're investing in and these are all the newest most efficient aircraft, so they're going to have a nice CASM benefit for us.","Hunter Keay","Right. Okay. And then Scott, you used to say the old Orion system used to underforecast demand. Is it possible given all the investments in the premium products you guys are making and the strength in business travel that Gemini is still underforecasting some of that close-in demand strength now?","Andrew Nocella","I think Jamie -- Hunter, its Andrew, sorry. I think we've made a lot of progress with Gemini and we've been very careful on to change our booking curve reflect the fact that we have more close-in demand. So, we learn from it every day obviously and we get better and better at it.","But there may be still some upside there as we kind of go through the rest of the year as we tweak how we work with Gemini. So, that's more to come I think. But we've been very conscious to make sure that we start changing our booking curve to reflect the revenue potential of the airline and we successfully did that in Q1 and we think we're well on our way to doing that in Q2.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie","Hey, good morning. Thanks guys. A couple of questions. Regarding the news that's spilling into the media regarding negotiations with Expedia, I guess, first, how material is Expedia to the overall distribution of United's inventory first?","And then second some investors are going to ask, of course, what it means for the full year guide in yield. So, I'm just wondering if you can help put some numbers around how to think about that.","Andrew Nocella","This is Andrew. Maybe I'll try to answer that question. It's complicated from the perspective of we can sell tickets in many, many different ways. But we were clear earlier this year that we'll be moving on, on the distribution partners better suited to our future not our past. Expedia tried to stop us and quite frankly failed.","The most simple way to say this is time to change. Companies need to evolve and innovate and we hear United have changed a lot. We have in particular invested in our own website and our app to be much more cost effective to be transparent and come up with the optimal sales abilities to distribute our content.","Expedia has historically been very good in selling our lowest fares. But quite honestly we think we can sell our lowest fares just as well and that's where we are. So, we look forward to having a direct relationship with our customers going forward and that's really where we are with Expedia.","Scott Kirby","And I would just add since you asked about the full year guide we've assumed from the full year that effective at the end of September, we will not be in Expedia and we are still comfortable with our $10 to $12 guide.","Daniel McKenzie","Thank you. I appreciate that. And then I guess Andrew or Scott given the Easter shift, you've -- obviously, we hear the commentary on demand. But how would you characterize core underlying booking volumes? Is it normal elevated below average? So, on the first call you shared some booking perspective and it is helpful to have some volume perspective behind the revenue guide. So, just some perspective on how consumers are digesting what's going on with kind of the existing yield backdrop.","Andrew Nocella","Sure. Well, as we talked about Q1 we thought was very strong. And as we look forward into Q2, I would say the same that we're really happy with demand levels across the Board. There are a few pockets, Argentina being one of them, that's a little weak. But overall we feel really good about this.","Europe, for the next few weeks, is weak due to the Easter holiday shift, but after that looks really great in both cabins. And Latin America is I think clearly going to be our best-performing entity of the quarter and a big part of that is the Easter shift.","So, there's a lot going on. A lot of the holidays have moved which affects how we look at things. But I would say the underlying demand that we see are going -- or particularly as we look out into May and June is very good.","Operator","Thank you. From Credit Suisse, we have Joe Caiado.","Jose Caiado","Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. Andrew are you able to quantify the contribution from Premium Plus revenue flights that's embedded in the Q2 revenue guide?","Andrew Nocella","It's really insignificant at this point. I will say we started selling -- or we started flying the cabin earlier this month, Tokyo-Newark was the first route. And there's a couple of things we're looking at one of them what is the yield versus coach. And as I said earlier, that's tracking to more than two times coach.","The other thing is we had expectations for load factors in excess -- payload factors in excess of 70%. And in fact the first two weeks the payload factor has been 89%. So, we've got this -- we really started-off with a great few weeks here with this new product, but this is really early days on very few of our aircraft today. But every day there'll be more and more.","Ultimately, Premium Plus will be 7% to 8% of our wide-body capacity going forward. And given what we've seen over the last two weeks we think this will have an impact on our 2020 and 2021 financials in a really important way. So, I can't say how excited we are in particular given the data points we've seen over the last two weeks.","Jose Caiado","That's very helpful color, I appreciate that. Gerry one for you. Can you just maybe parse some of the puts and takes with respect to the unit cost outlook here for the year? I mean MAX is obviously adding some pressure, the lower capacity growth, but the change to the full year unit cost outlook is fairly small. So, can you just talk about some of the offsets and where those cost controls are really shining through or maybe what's outperforming your expectations?","Gerry Laderman","I would just say it's indicative of the fact that as of now the number of MAXes we have is relatively small part of the fleet. So, the adjustment right now is solely a result of the MAXes and the suspension of service to Delhi and that pretty much everything else is tracking as we expected and that this is simply the arithmetic of changing the capacity outlook.","Operator","And thank you. From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth.","Savanthi Syth","Hey, good morning. Two quick follow-up just on the MAX grounding. Could there be an impact on CapEx this year kind of what your expectations are for when deliveries will resume?","Gerry Laderman","Obviously, if the grounding lasted long enough, Boeing wouldn't be able to deliver aircraft. But expectation that if this returned to service this summer, it won't impact the timing of our deliveries beyond this year. So, the aircraft scheduled for delivery this year we would expect to take this year.","Savanthi Syth","Okay. Great. And then just on the other revenue, the non-passenger revenue. Any thoughts on kind of what you're seeing on the cargo front? And then also just the other revenue ancillaries doing really well, but other revenues kind of lost a bit of its momentum and kind of when you might expect that to pick up outside of new credit card deal or anything.","Greg Hart","Hey Savi, this is Greg. I'll take the cargo piece and then turn it over to Scott for the rest of the question. On the cargo side, our cargo revenues were down 2.5% roughly, driven largely by capacity in the industry. But relative to our -- the performance of our peers, we continue to be really, really happy with the performance of our cargo team and driving a really, really good product for us across the network.","Andrew Nocella","And the other revenue category -- this is Andrew speaking. Last year we had one-time payment from Chase that we didn't get this year so that -- I think that reflects a big chunk if not the majority of the change.","Operator","Thank you. From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker.","Helane Becker","Thanks operator. Hi team, thank you for taking my question. My first question is -- and has Boeing offered you any compensation or offer to make you whole at all on that MAX being grounded?","Gerry Laderman","Hey, Helane, it's Gerry. So, right now we're focused on assisting every way we can with regulators and with Boeing on solving the problem and that's all we're focused on.","Having said that, obviously, there are some costs that we've been incurring and we expect to continue to incur. Boeing has been a great partner of ours for decades. And if you use some historical references such as the 787 situation a number of years ago we'll have a conversation with Boeing and I expect like we always do to resolve whatever that conversation is in a way that works for both of us.","Helane Becker","Okay. Thanks, Gerry. And then my other question is completely unrelated and really has to do more with customer service. I think Denver airport right now is undergoing some construction in the main area where you go through security and Newark is certainly going through construction and seems to have been under construction for the better part of I don't know one, 1.5 years or so. Can you just talk about; A, any impact that has on your customer experience and whether or not -- and how long that will continue to go on for\u2026?","Greg Hart","Helane this is Greg. Thanks for the questions. We always work very closely with all of our airport partners in making sure that we mitigate as much as possible the impact on the customers. And a lot of the projects you actually talked about by the time they're finished will actually materially improve the experience for our customers.","So these projects aren't easy. They are complex. And from time-to-time, we do get together with our partners and reassess where we are and what changes we may need to make to the programs to ensure that the impact on our customers is mitigated as much as possible.","Helane Becker","Thank you.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Mike Linenberg.","Mike Linenberg","Yeah, hey good morning, everyone. Hey, two quick ones here. Andrew just on PRASM for the June quarter, you mentioned that Latin America was going to be the best March quarter. Pacific looked like that was the best performer. Is there a moderation in Pacific? And what really -- what drove Pacific strength in the March quarter? Can you just give us some of the highlights? Thank you.","Andrew Nocella","Yeah. Again great quarter really happy with the performance, but I'll try to give you a little bit more color. But in the March quarter across the Pacific we saw a good strength across really the entire region, but it was in the economy class cabin so that's actually great to see. We've seen really good strength in business class for a long time. So it's really nice to see the economy cabin catching back up across Pacific.","Latin America as I said had a great quarter and looks really stellar for Q2. A big part of that is Easter shift and Latin America is doing incredibly well. But we see that strength continuing into May and June at this point as well. And the Atlantic again looks fantastic for May and June at this rate. And I'm really I think very bullish on the entire international entity for 2Q as a result.","Mike Linenberg","Okay, great. And just my second question to Scott with Los Angeles unveiling the terminal zero and terminal nine projects, is that -- is terminal nine, is that the missing puzzle piece for United in L.A.?","Scott Kirby","That's probably an accurate description. We'll look forward to having terminal nine built someday. And today we're really full at Los Angeles. We have incredible utilization on our gates and we will look forward to the opportunity to get more gates and grow in Los Angeles at some point in the future when that's done.","Operator","And from Goldman Sachs, we have Catherine O'Brien.","Catherine O\u2019Brien","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. With the progress you've seen in the last two quarters in margin expansion, could you talk about where your networks are seeing the biggest improvement? Is that all the mid-con hubs re-banking? Are there certain initiatives like segmentation there driving that? What's really been maybe the margin -- the leader of margin improvement you've seen over the last two quarters?","Andrew Nocella","Sure. I'll try to take that on. I mean, really we have a whole host of commercial initiatives big and small. I mean, we've talked about all those on the call before and we tend not to break out the value for each of them individually for a lot of different reasons but it's all the usual suspects.","In particular the performance in the mid-con hubs as we generate this incremental connectivity, which is key to -- or trying to accomplish we're really, really focused on that and that's a big part of it.","But basic economy and the segmentation and where we're going on our Premium Plus, Premium Plus has a lot to offer in the future given its brand new. So, I'm really excited about the broad array of commercial initiatives we have and what they're going to deliver over the medium and long run.","And then the last thing I'll say is the international potential of the company is incredible. We're starting Naples and Prague in a few week's time and we now have the ability to successfully we believe fly to Cape Town South Africa with a 787. So we have a lot of potential in the long run for our international division.","But when you bring all of these commercial initiatives together with the product changes we're making, the connectivity changes, the schedule changes that will break the liability of our offering in the marketplace, I think you see the results that we saw in the first quarter and what we anticipate in 2Q of this year.","Catherine O\u2019Brien","Understood. Thanks so much for that color. And then maybe one more. So, in the past you've spoken about the importance of scope to compete with your major airline peers. With the innovation of the CRJ-550, do you feel better about your competitive position even in the event you don't get an increased scope? Or is that still top of mind in your discussions with the pilots?","Scott Kirby","So, actually I think you used the word there of scope really that we don't use. It is -- it's important that we'll be able to grow United Airlines. It's important that we will do that in a way that is good for our pilots and all of our employees, our customers and our shareholders.","And so getting to a win-win position where we can offer our customers a great product in the markets that aren't large enough for mainline flying is really important. The CRJ-550 is going to give us a unique ability to compete for premium demand that none of our competitors have, but it still remains important. And we are working with our pilots on it to find a win-win solution that allows us to be competitive with other full service carriers across the board.","And I'm confident that we're going to get there, we're going to do it in a way that is a win for us and our pilots feel good about being a win for them and their growth opportunities in the future.","Operator","Thank you. From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is actually Matt [ph] on for Brandon. So now you have all the mid-con hubs re-banked, I want to just come back to the opportunity there. Is it fair to say that the focus remains on the mid-cons to continue to optimize schedules? And really, how would we see -- is there a lot of opportunity left to make improvements within the hubs?","Andrew Nocella","Sure. Andrew speaking. As we look at it what we're trying to do in the mid-con hubs is create a sufficient level of connectivity, a level of connectivity that quite frankly some of our competitors have had for years and for a number of reasons United didn't have.","So we're well on our way, but we're still well short of the number of aircraft we want to have on the ground at the same time to create that level of connectivity. And we've adjusted the structures in each of the hubs to make that happen. And as we continue down this path, we will build the connectivity to make all of that come together and build our RASM strength. So we measure the connectivity how we rate versus others in similar sized cities and we still see a significant gap that we're closing over the next years or so.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, cool. Now just a quick follow-up on that. Are there any structural limitations, or whether it's airport on the structure or employees or anything that could inhibit that growth or is that something -- particularly in Denver and Houston? I know Chicago has a little bit more. But anything to be aware of as you deploy that growth strategy?","Andrew Nocella","So across all the different teams here at United, we've outlined where we're going as a team and whether it be the number of jetways that are hanging in the airport or the baggage system or ticket counter space, we've factored all of those issues into what we need to achieve the growth plan that we designed.","So every airport has unique characteristics. Every airport has some strength. There's no doubt about that. But the plan that we've designed, we've designed an infrastructure plan around it that we can achieve in the short run to allow it all to happen. So there's nothing that's going to stop us from achieving the plan that we've laid out at this point in time.","Operator","Thank you. From Bernstein, we have David Vernon.","David Vernon","Hey good morning guys. Thanks. Andrew, I just wanted to follow up on the 78% -- 7% to 8% of capacity that's going to be Premium Plus. I think you said that was wide-body. Can you tell us kind of what the ramp should be over the next couple of years? I think that was a long-term goal but I want to see kind of what the volume number we should be working with for 2020 would be?","Andrew Nocella","Yes. So, I think most of that is definitely all of that's online in 2021 and then it phases, so a little bit next year in 2020 and then all of it in 2021. The level is as we stand here today, while it's on quite a few aircraft actually, we're very careful on where we sell it as Premium Plus because we want to ensure that the right aircraft shows up at the right gates that have the product on board. So in year one of Premium Plus, we actually have the seats onboard, but we really can't monetize it the way we'd like to. So in 2020, you should see I would say in round numbers, 3%, 3.5% of our wide-body capacity being sold effectively as Premium Plus. In 2021, then we'd be between 7% and 8%.","Operator","And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. (Operator Instructions) And from The Associated Press, we have David Koenig. David, your line is open. (Operator Instructions) ","David Koenig","I'm sorry. Two things, one super quick. If Gerry could complete his answer that he gave about MAX deliveries or any scheduled in the fourth quarter, we heard about two in 3Q. And then my question then Greg mentioned this in response to Jamie Baker, exactly what kind of maintenance are you deferring while your MAX 9s are grounded? And how much extra have you spent to-date to protect your schedule from those groundings?","Gerry Laderman","So, on the deliveries, no we had no aircraft scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter. Although I would expect that some of those third quarter aircraft end up slipping to the fourth quarter, but there were no previously scheduled fourth quarter deliveries.","David Koenig","Okay, great.","Greg Hart","And then on the maintenance work that we've deferred to help cover the MAX schedule ranges from WiFi installations to voluntary -- other voluntary maintenance work that we've had scheduled that is perfectly able to be deferred to a later date as well as something as simple as pay in an aircraft we've deferred. So it kind of runs the gamut across what we do in the maintenance world on a voluntary basis.","Scott Kirby","But importantly, it's no safety-related item.","David Koenig","Exactly. That's what people wanted to know. And then how much extra have you spent so far to keep your schedule intact more or less?","Greg Hart","I don't think, we have that answer for you, but it was not material.","David Koenig","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And from The Wall Street Journal, we have Alison Sider.","Alison Sider","Good morning, hi. My questions are just sort of given the incidents and what's been detailed in the preliminary report. Are you satisfied with pilot training at Ethiopian Airlines and safety practices? How confident are you feeling sending customers on codeshare flight with Ethiopian? Or is that something you're reviewing just in light of everything that's happened?","Scott Kirby","We are confident in the training programs at United Airlines and what we do for training our pilots. I don't think we're prepared to comment on the training programs at Ethiopian. We do have a process that we go through and will continue to go through that involves IOSA standards for auditing, for all of our codeshare partners that we use, but we don't have specific commentary on their training programs.","Alison Sider","So when mentioned an auditing process, is that something like initiated for Ethiopian now? Or is that something that they would undergo when you strike out a partnership? Or is it going to be an additional review of Ethiopian or your partners generally?","Scott Kirby","We go through that audit process with all of our partners and we have done that for at least as long as I've been in the airline industry.","Operator","Thank you. From Bloomberg News, we have Justin Bachman.","Justin Bachman","Hi, thanks for the time. I wanted to focus on the CASM-ex performance in the first quarter and wondering if you could go through some of the buckets that went into that performance in terms of the capacity growth and the maintenance deferrals that you did. And sort of what are the different areas that make that up and sort of by percentages? And secondly on CapEx, what -- when you have aircraft scheduled for delivery what's the breakdown of cost to United for pre-delivery payments versus what you pay upon delivery of the aircraft? Thank you.","Gerry Laderman","So I'll take that second question first and that breakdown between pre-delivery deposits and what we pay at delivery varies airline to airline and it's really not something airlines specifically talk about. That might be a better question for Boeing to answer.","With respect to first quarter CASMex performance which did end up somewhat better than our expectations, but really a lot of that was just timing, certain maintenance events that nothing more than we expected for instance some engine maintenance that ended up not having to be done, but we would expect that to be done later in the year. It's that sort of thing. It's strictly timing versus what our original expectations were.","Justin Bachman","Okay. But -- and then how much of that was just overall capacity growth that you have planned as far as the mix of -- was that active management? Or was it some of just the function of the airline's growth?","Gerry Laderman","Well clearly the growth of ASMs helps us manage our CASM, but that's all built into the plan.","Operator","Thank you. From Reuters, we have Tracy Rucinski.","Tracy Rucinski","Hi, good morning. One quick question. Talking about pilot training, will you be requiring simulator training on the MAX?","Greg Hart","Hey this is Greg. If you don't mind, I'd just like to provide a little context to your question. Based on the preliminary results of the investigations of the Lion Air and Ethiopian accidents, runaway trim was among the primary causes of the accidents. For decades, all of our pilots -- all of our Boeing aircraft here at United have been trained to respond to a runaway trim situation.","In fact, the training around the situation is so central for our curriculum that the pilots are required to memorize the procedure. That's why we have consistently reiterated our confidence and ability of United pilots to safely operate United MAX aircraft. Now of course, if the regulatory authorities require any changes to our training programs, we will comply with them.","Tracy Rucinski","Okay. So no decision yet then on simulator training?","Greg Hart","Right now, we have no plans to add any simulator training to our training regime. But obviously if federal -- if the regulatory authorities request that as added training, we will comply with that request.","Operator","And thank you. That was our last question. I will now turn the call back to Mike Leskinen for closing remarks.","Mike Leskinen","Thanks to all for joining the call today. Please contact Media Relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","And thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.","I will now turn the meeting over to your host for today's call, Jonathan Ireland. Please go ahead, sir.","Jonathan Ireland","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This morning we issued our earnings release and separate investor update, both are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in this morning's earnings release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represents the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for more thorough description of these factors.","Also, during the course of our call we'll discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures please refer to the tables at end of our earnings release and investor update. Copies of which are available on our website. Unless otherwise noted special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Acting CEO, Brett Hart; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart; and Senior Vice President, Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. Brett will begin with some overview comments, after which Greg will an update on our operations. Jim will follow the discussion on the revenue and capacity. Gerry will review our costs, fleet and capital structure after which we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We'd appreciate it if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Brett.","Brett Hart","Thanks, Jonathan. And thank you all for joining us on our third quarter 2015 earnings call. As you are no doubt aware our new CEO, Oscar Munoz is currently on medical leave while he recovers from a heart attack he suffered late last week. The entire United family has Oscar in our thoughts and prayers. To provide leadership during this period, our Board of Directors had asked me to work with our experienced leadership team and serve as Acting CEO in Oscar's absence. We will continue to push forward the agenda we've laid out over the past six weeks, focuses on customer service, team work and innovation with safety always remaining paramount.","Like Oscar, I believe United has the people to network and the assets to achieve the same or greater margins as our peers. And I with our management team will continue to take steps necessary to get us there. The last several weeks have been very eventful for United. With news of Oscar's heart attack hitting many of us hard. However, I want to assure you that the United team has never been more unified and committed to the goal of making United great again. ","Turning to our third quarter results. This morning we reported pretax earnings of $1.7 billion, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. Our return on invested capital was 19.8% over the last 12 months and we decreased our non-fuel unit cost in the quarter. Our employees' hard work is a significant contributor to these results. And I want personally thank them for the many contributions to our success. ","I will now turn the call over to Greg to provide more information on United's operational performance. ","Greg Hart","Thanks, Brett. And thank you to everyone for joining the call this morning. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their tremendous work through the busy summer season. Day and day out United employees are showing their commitment to improving our operational performance and a considerable progress we made reflects their continued dedication and hard work. Our entire team recognizes that United still has an opportunity to improve the operation. And we are all focused on raising our performance to level we and our customers expect. However, I do want highlight the progress we have made this year. Year-to-date our consolidated on time performance is five points better than the same period last year. Year-to-date completion grade also improved significantly as we have cancelled over 30,000 fewer flights in last year which translates into 2.7 million. In fact, year-to-date including both the mainline and express operation, we have a better completion rate that our main competitors in New York and Chicago, and we have better completion in Houston that our major competitor in Dallas. ","Finally, in September we set an all time record for bag handling. And so far this year a mishandle bag rate is 9% better. Over the past several calls, I talked about the investments we've made to improve the operations. The third quarter results showed that these investments along with the hard work of our front line employees are beginning to take hold. ","I'd also like to highlight our cargo operation. Cargo revenue in the third quarter was approximately flat year-over-year. While this year has been challenging with declining surcharges and increasing industry cargo capacity, the team has done excellent work offsetting this pressure through an intense focus on expanding our market share. Year-to-date, United's market share A4 carriers improved approximately 10% compared to the same period last year. This led to approximately 8% growth in cargo revenue over the last 12 months. A period in which our major competitor saw their revenue decline.","To the entire operation's team, I want to thank you for a very good year so far, but we still have a long journey ahead, you should all be proud of the significant progress we've made. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Compton","Thanks, Greg. Again this quarter, I'd like to thank our customers for fly in United. Many of you have noted the improvement in our products and our operation. And we are continuing to do more everyday to deliver the product you desire. In the third quarter, our consolidated unit revenue declined 5.8% in line with our expectations. The four factors we discussed in our prior earnings call, a strong US dollar, and the effects of lower oil prices, pressure as a result of margin accretive initiative and competitive pricing actions contributed to negative unit revenue growth year-over-year. In the third quarter, we amended our co-branded credit card agreement with Chase and Visa more than two years before the original expiration date. We expect the multiyear extension will generate in an incremental $200 million of revenue in the second half of the year and approximately $400 million of incremental revenue for 2016. ","Turning to the fourth quarter. We expect our unit revenue to decline approximately 4% to 6% year-over-year. The major drivers of a fourth quarter decline are similar to those in the third quarter. We expect the foreign exchange impact to account for 1.5 points of year-over-year PRASM pressure. Assuming current conditions continue, we anticipate that the impact of lower surcharges particularly in Japan will account for approximately one point of weakness. We continue to see degradation from our corporate energy customers. With revenue down approximately 35% year-over-year representing roughly one point of PRASM decline. We also expect the current competitive pricing actions will drive approximately 1.5 points of decline in the quarter. Finally, the margin accretive actions we are taking such as installing slimline seats are anticipated to drive approximately 0.5 PRASM decline.","I'd like to take this opportunity to speak briefly about our presence in China. China continues to be an important and profitable market for United. We are closely monitoring the changing dynamics of its economy. Following the currency devaluation and Chinese stock market decline in August, we saw a brief drop in bookings. However, bookings recovered nicely and have rebounded to near pre -devaluation levels. A second factor we continue to experience, a significant competitive capacity growth in China. For the fourth quarter we anticipate an approximately 35% increase in non - United capacity growth year-over-year. Despite these pressures, our major shipments is in the US China market is an asset which will produce returns on our investments now and over the longer term. Results in Chengdu saw meaningful year-over-year improvement. And we are continuing to execute on our China's strategy with our new non stop service to Shiyan, China. While the current revenue environment is challenging, it is important that we take steps to capture incremental revenue by better meeting our customers' needs. For example, we know that our business customers prefer two cabin aircraft over single cabin 50 seat aircraft. We have responded by significantly increasing the number of two cabin regional jets for mainline aircraft and routes where we previously flew small regional jets without materially affecting capacity. To that end, 79% of United's top 100 business markets are now operated exclusively with two cabinet aircraft on weekdays. This is up from 59% in November of 2013. To put in a slightly different perspective, 94% of the flight in these markets will be flown with two cabin aircraft. We will continue this transition in the quarters ahead. While this is just one initiative, it is a good example of how we are listening to our customers and responding appropriately. ","With respect to capacity. In the fourth quarter, we expect to grow approximately 1% to 2%. This 0.5 point increase versus our prior guidance is due to higher completion factor as improved operations are driving fewer cancel flights. For the full year 2016, we anticipate growing capacity approximately 1.5% to 2.5%. With a quarter of point due to leap year adding an additional day to the calendar. ","In conclusion, as we move into 2016, we will begin lapping many of the headwinds to run your performance and expect quarter-over-quarter PRASM improvement. We are working to return PRASM growth which will be supported by our advancement in our operation, network and customer service. We want to be the carrier of choice and we will continue to take the necessary actions to achieve that goal. ","With that I'll turn it over to Gerry. ","Gerry Laderman","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let me also thank our employees for another record quarter which was a direct result of their hard work and dedication. In the third quarter, our pretax profit was $1.7 billion excluding special items, the pretax margin of 16.6%. We increased our earnings per share by 65% year-over-year, generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and achieved a 12 months return on invested capital of 19.8%. Our GAAP net income was $4.8 billion but that includes a non-cash special item of $3.2 billion related to the reversal of our tax valuation allowance in the quarter.","Non fuel cost performance in the third quarter was excellent. With consolidated CASM excluding fuel profit sharing and third party business expense decreasing 1.5% year-over-year. We expect CASM excluding those items to be flat to up 1% for the fourth quarter and to be down approximately 0.5% for the full year. Sensible cost management is critical for United's financial success. To the first nine months of this year, we've achieved approximately $600 million in non fuel savings through our project quality efficiency initiative and we expect to realize $800 million for the full year. We continue to expect achieve our goal of $1 billion in annual non fuel cost savings by the end of next year, a full year in advance of our initial expectations. ","Turning to fuel expense. We recorded a hedge loss of approximately $250 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter we are approximately 23% hedged and based on the October 15 forward curve, we expect to incur approximately $275 million in hedge losses while participating in approximately 81% of any future price declines. For 2016, we have about 17% of our expected fuel consumption hedge. This hedge is currently in a loss position of approximately $43 million, but does allow us to participate in approximately 93% of any future decline in oil prices. ","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve a pretax margin between 9.5% and 11.5% in the quarter with pressure coming from passenger revenue, offset by improved mileage plus revenue combined with lower fuel prices and solid non fuel cost performance. ","As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, our top priority is investing in our business. We believe it is critical that our employees are provided the tools to do their jobs efficiently and effectively. Our investments are major contributor to our improving operational performance and we will continue to look for investments to further advance our progress in this area. In the quarter, we spent over $700 million on capital expenditures and continue to expect to spend approximately $3.2 billion for the full year. Part of this capital is allocated to aircraft. In the quarter, we took delivery of six 737-900ERs, four 787-9 and one new 737-700. We also added 16 additional, 76 seat Embraer E175 regional aircraft and now the 75 of these customer pleasing regional aircraft in our fleet.","Debt repayment and pension funding were minimal in the quarter as we made excellent progress, paying down debt and funding our pension in the first half of the year. So far this year, we made more than $900 million of debt repayment and contributed $800 million to our pension plans. Actions like this strengthening our balance sheet and demonstrate our commitment to reducing the financial risk in our business. Additionally, providing a meaningful return to our investors is fundamental to our capital allocation plan. In the third quarter, we spent $262 million in share repurchases. So far this month, we've spent approximately $100 million more to repurchase United stock and this morning we also entered into a $300 million accelerated share repurchase program that will be completed within three months. Furthermore, this program does not prohibit us from making additional open market repurchases of our stock throughout the duration of the program. ","To wrap up, we are proud of our results this quarter and we will continue to focus on delivering strong earnings and allocating our capital in a thoughtful and balanced manner. The investments we are making in our people and our product will ensure a great future. Finally, I just want to reiterate what we said earlier. The thoughts of everyone here are with Oscar and his family.","I'll now turn it back over to Brett for closing remarks. ","Brett Hart","Thanks, Gerry. Thank you again to everyone who joined the call this morning. This had been a challenging few weeks for us. And we are proud of how the United family has come together. Now let me go, we ask our customers and our employees to tell us how we could do things better. And we have heard from thousands of you. We are reading and listening to every single suggestion and in the upcoming weeks, we will be announcing some changes that are a direct result of your feedback. We believe like you that United can be great again. And it is with your ideas, your support and dedication that we will as one United team be successful. ","I'll now turn the call over to Jonathan to open the call for questions. ","Jonathan Ireland","Thank you, Brett. First, we will take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask the questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Thank you. From Deutsche Bank we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg ","Yes, Hey, good morning, everybody. Question to Jim. Jim, when you highlighted the sort of the four issues that have been undermining the revenue performance, you talked about the fourth one being this competitive pricing issue. And I know you sort of characterized it as such on this call. But when we look at the guidance that was put out today, I mean rather than competitive pricing I mean it's referenced as softening of domestic yields and maybe I'm just reading too much into it, but when I sort of see that it tells me maybe this is a bigger issue and maybe it is more of a demand issue rather than just a carriers going rogue on pricing. Can you just give us some additional thoughts on that?","Jim Compton","Hey, Mike, excellent question. We are not seeing --if I talk about let's break it out, top of the domestic based on your question. We actually see what I would call a lukewarm or tepid demand and really good demand continuing kind of what we have seen in the third quarter and so for as we head into the fourth quarter. And so that as we think about our guidance, the items that highlighted whether be it foreign exchange, we still have that impact year-over-year and if you took today's current exchange rates, you would begin to fully lap that in the second quarter of 2016. Then there is the internationally jumping there is lower surcharges but that also flows across to domestic and impact domestic also, that given current surcharges with lap itself also in second quarter. And then we are somewhat unique with energy. And in the energy as I mentioned we are seeing about 35% declines in our corporate revenue associated with that sector. And quite frankly that we talked about that in 20% in the first quarter, 30% in the second quarter so 35% in the third. We continue to see a drift towards that 40%, so as I think about the fourth quarter that would be kind of demand maybe that you are point to that we would see given our presence in Houston that might be what you are alluding to. But at the end of the day also if you think about the course of the year, our expectations of demand at the beginning of the year are clearly lower as reflected in where GDP has gone through the year. So as we think about next year, many of those elements will start to lap but we are still focused on where that demand will be versus our expectations. We are planning around 2% to 3% GDP in 2016 but like this year we want to keep our eyes and monitor on where demand versus expectations go.","Michael Linenberg ","Great, very helpful. Then just my second question and this is to Gerry on the fleet. If I sort of look at your latest fleet schedule and I kind of look back the last time you published it, doesn't seem like there's much change on mainline. I think be holding a 747, you're holding onto it a little bit longer that maybe what you had previously expected. But when I look at the regional side, it does look like that your holding onto some of those airplanes a little bit longer. I think there was a bigger reduction in the regional fleet a few months back. Is that a function of maybe some of the issues that one of your regional carriers is facing and so in order to maybe back fill for some of that it makes sense to maybe keep some of these airplanes in the fleet longer? What's driving that?","Gerry Laderman","Mike, it is really just kind of timing issue on a few aircraft. It doesn't change sort of our long term view on where the fleet is headed and you will see over time less regional flying, more mainline flying as we up gauge but I wouldn't read too much into the change in the year end number. ","Operator","From Buckingham Research we have Daniel McKenzie on line. Please go ahead.","Daniel McKenzie","Hey, good morning, guys. Brett, congratulations on being selected to step up here and my condolences, I know you guys are all close to Oscar. I know you're still getting your feet wet in the role here but given your customer service responsibility this year I'm wondering if that's something you would want to talk to. What have you found? Where's the low hanging fruit and where do we go from here?","Brett Hart","Yes, appreciate that Dan. We have been focused for some time and course of the year on improving customer service and identifying areas where we can impact make a difference and where possible make a difference in the short run. Oscar certainly coming in and taking the time to talk to customers and employees, he is laser focused on that area as well. And this would be certainly one of those areas where we could say that our efforts are being expedited. I think that you see changes and improvement and you probably already are in areas like our ability to do with regular operations. And you will see us addressing the boarding process. You will see a number of changes related to the overall in flight experience. But we should keep in mind that at the very core, operational reliability is really the driver for customer satisfaction. I can ask Greg to add anything that he likes to add on this point as well. ","Greg Hart","Yes. Oscar obviously capable of as Brett mentioned a laser like focused on a number of things. One of which was reliability and it is really continuing the trend we started little bit over a year ago in terms of making improvements in the operations and rethinking really everything that we do each and everyday. And exciting thing for all of us is we are on the front end of a whole host of activities that we've engaged in over the past year to improve the operation. We got a wave of things that are coming to, that will help carry us forward in terms of improvements. ","Daniel McKenzie","Very good. I guess just second follow-up here. One message that I'm really hearing from you is 59% of the departures getting a heck of a lot better from a margin profitability perspective just given the RJ restructuring and you are obviously talking about getting back to margins relative to your peers. What are you seeing exactly in that part of the business in terms of profit improvement and where to be go from here? What any there in really with the RJ restructuring? ","Jim Compton","Hey, Dan. This is Jim. If you think about in two pieces and we feel lot obviously strong initiative introducing the E-175 into the network. And we are very far along in that path and we finish that rolling out that path as we move into 2016, we are very far along. I would say in terms of the regional piece and becoming less depended on it, if you think about continuing to remove 50 seat regional jets for about halfway in total when you combined that with where we are in the 76 seater in terms of restructuring the network. So we are very excited about it. You are right we are seeing the benefits that product of two class cabin, it is comes in a number of ways. One is just more competitive in this high business market. Secondly, it is introducing the ability to drive ancillary revenue which have been very successful on this year, introduces with that 76 seater we put in mainline when it substituting for 50 seater, a first class and economy class. So the network is responding really, really well in terms of as we gauge really gauging strategy to be much more competitive across the domestic network. ","Operator","From Cowen and Co we have Helane Becker on line. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker ","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. So just one question here with respect to-- actually I have two questions. There were some stories in the press this morning about some of the Chinese airlines merger cargo and operations and then some speculation that maybe some of the larger airlines would merge. I don't necessarily want you to comment on what you can't comment on, but I am just kind of curious China Southern is a sky team member in Air China is star lines member so have you thought about how something like that would affect your operations in China going forward?","Jim Compton","Hey, Helane. This is Jim. Air China is a tremendous partner of ours and quite frankly we are continuing to build that relationship as we grow in China. And lot of degrees here to your questions obviously China is a very competitive market and as I mentioned we see non UA capacity growing 35% in the fourth quarter. I'll tell you it's very profitable for us and its profitability quarter-over-quarter has continue through the first three quarters this year and I expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. And is built on really strong plan that we've talked about in the past. One is capturing the demand that is very strong out of China. If you think about the demand in China what we are finding is that although there is a large capacity increase, as the economy grows it stimulates more traffic. There is also existing traffic from China to the US many times goes over other connecting point such as Korea. So it is non stop come in but we capturing of that traffic too. So not only is that a market that's growing in new demand, we are actually recapturing some of that connecting traffic over hub such in Korea. That being said, our strategy again is also depended on the secondary cities not just the Beijing and Shanghai. And a lot of studies have shown that the demand for China will double by 2020, half of that demand is going to come from secondary cities. So when we are look at our due service out of San Francisco, it's exceeding our expectations in doing very well year-over-year. And that's heart of that strategy which is why we are excited about our second secondary city San Francisco to Shiyan. So I know I answered your question, China is an important part of our network, very profitable, extremely competitive in whether it's cargo or whether it's passenger carriers, but we think we are really well positioned to keep building on the profitability that we have there. ","Brett Hart","Hi, Helane. This is Brett. Just to put a point on that I think the second part of your question. We are just in a position to speculate on rumors related to potential mergers. ","Helane Becker","Okay, no, that's fine. And then I just have a completely unrelated question. How far along are you in -- I know this I'm not saying it the right way. But how close are you to the cap on 70 C aircraft with respect to your scope clause?","Gerry Laderman ","Helane, based on what we have in the pipeline, we would hit that cap sometime next year as we bring in the rest of the 175's.","Operator","From Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay online. Please go ahead. ","Hunter Keay","Good morning. One of the things that investors point to continually with United is the free cash flow yield. But you guys don't really talk about cash flow. You don't talk about free flow, I don't think you ever guided to and if you talk with people that believe in your stock, it has the potential to be one of the best free cash flow stories around. Good and even better industrial companies guide to free cash flow regularly so I guess two questions for you. Why aren't you talking about your free cash flow more and highlighting what can really be sort of industry best in story there? Is it something that we need to know about that maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves and if you care to put in a guidepost how should think about free cash generation next year, I would love to hear that too.","Gerry Laderman","So, Hunter, it is Gerry. This year as you know has been a great year for free cash flow and really kind of the first year that we made terrific progress in that direction. So it is something we look at. I personally get little bothered by the way it's typically calculated only because in airline has a significant CapEx exposure to new aircraft and depending on how we choose to finance new aircraft that has a material impact on free cash flow. So what we are doing is kind of thinking about the best way to look at that and manage that and work with you and others on how best to deliver that message. But it is a focus of ours. ","Hunter Keay","Okay. And then in the context of capital returns, I know that you guys said that you're going to be ramping up the buyback in the fourth quarter which is great. It's good to see that certainly, but do we need new leadership to come in and to really sort of bless a more aggressive capital deployment strategy? Or is this something that the current leadership team has the willingness and ability to do on an interim basis in the event that you can be opportunistic on your stock in terms of buying it back and in the event that you guys do have a bunch of cash coming into the business next year either be a debt which are going to raise for new aircraft acquisitions or the free cash flow itself, is there any recent think why the pace of the share buyback should not be materially increase in all of equal environment as we move through the course of 2016?","Gerry Laderman","So, Hunter, as Brett said earlier we are moving forward with our plan and certainly my plan in finance is to balance capital deployment. It has been in place for quite while. Now granted in the third quarter, our share buyback may not have been what some people would have expected, but keep in mind that was the circumstances we were dealing within the third quarter. We just felt it was prudent to maintain the steady pace we were at. But as you can see what we have done this month already between what we actually purchase in the open market and the ASR that we entered into that's $400 million dedicated to the share repurchase in this month. So we are absolutely committed to contributing our current $3 billion program at or ahead of schedule. So that will continue. And let me talk about the other parts of the capital deployment strategy. It is absolutely essential that we make the investments we have to make in our people and our processes now systems and our product. It's going to be done sensibly and these investments need to be margin neutral or margin accretive. And I think that those investments will be made within the CapEx guidance that we've been giving out. And then we got continued de-risking of our balance sheet. That's an area that we don't have a luxury any more for pre paying substantial amount of high coupon debt. As you know, we've done all that. So going forward as we continue to manage to the right level of debt, that will be a combination of the debt that amortizes over the next few years, it is billions of dollars. First of all, we manage financing for new aircraft then it's interesting situation because that's an area that we can access capital really, really cheaply whether it's through the capital market or through the banks. And we continue to manage that and in the process while I would expect that we would continue to finance most of our aircraft deliveries, we may not finance them to the level that we have in the past. And that's another way of getting to our goal of de-leveraging. But there is no question and as you saw given our commitment this month, we are very focused on as part of that also doing the right thing with returning capital to shareholders.","Operator","From Credit Suisse we have Julie Yates online. Please go ahead. ","Julie Yates","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Are you guys ready to give a split between the domestic and international growth embedded in the 2016 capacity guide? ","Jim Compton","Hey, Julie. This is Jim. We've guided to consolidated 1.5% to 2.5%. Right now as we look at capacity for 2016, we'd be up 1% to 2% on the domestic side and 2% to 3% on the international, so that's how we would split that 1.5% to 2.5%. And I've always say were going to keep our eye on demand and make sure that we have a best align or demand with capacity but we're really comfortable with that breakout right now. ","Julie Yates","Okay, great. And then any comments just directionally how that 2% to 3% internationally was split between the three geographies? ","Jim Compton","I will give you some direction that we recently and we're very excited about some markets we just announced, San Fran and Auckland, San Fran to Shiyan, China as well as San Fran -Tel Aviv. So San Francisco is a key focus for us to continue to capture the benefit in Asia as well as we have a terrific long history in Israel that we feel really excited about the San Francisco, Tel Aviv flights. So a lot of that off is West Coast or some -- there's a little bit of run rate in some areas this year, but that would be things that were ready to talk about right now.","Julie Yates","Okay, very helpful. And then Jim on the domestic PRASM, looks like that improves sequentially to a decline of 1.6% in Q3 which is about 180 basis points better than Q2 primarily on load factors, that's nicely ahead of the A4 average, it is pretty impressive given the pressures in Chicago and Houston. What's allowing you guys to outperform on domestic unit revenues and do you expect the domestic entity can continue to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter and into 2016 as well? ","Jim Compton","Julie, I think it is a number of things. And first point to some of the things that we talked about and the improvement on the operations as we gone through the year. The operations teams done a tremendous job. And so we are building that for a liability that we need to build and as Greg mentioned we have more to go and we are going to continue to do that. And so from revenue perspective you can clearly see that, that when you become carrier of choice and at the margin you build on that you see that incremental revenue come to us, we are very excited about that. The revenue management team although there is competitive pricing out there. We approach that as not one size result and so not into a lot of detail but the revenue management team works extremely hard particularly at high demand period to make sure that the best mix of demand is on the aircraft like and pull that off to really strong way. The network as we talked about as we begin our up gauging introducing two cabin aircraft into business market, it is giving up -- it is at the early stages of giving those results. So in number of those things and yet we do have those pressures not because of price expansion but the fact that the energy sector is now, I think the team has done a terrific job. Actually if you take a look at it and you referenced the 84A, our consolidated domestic length apologist arousing in the third quarter was it high it has been since 2011 on a relative basis to 84A peers, so we are really excited about the initiatives that teams driving, actually more excited about what we have come forward. ","Operator","From JPMorgan we have Jamie Baker on line. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker ","Hi, good morning. A question for Brett. We met with Oscar recently and he indicated and these are his words that United had lost its front line. And I for one appreciated the bluntness of that statement. He also indicated that he expected to have the final bench, manage of bench in place by year end. I know you spoke about pushing forward with the current agenda but I'm curious if your views on the front line and the timetable from management clearly are consistent with his.","Brett Hart","Yes, I appreciate that question, Jamie. I think first you have to put in the context what Oscar was doing in his seven weeks with the company and his commitment first and foremost was to get out into the operations to get down into break room or is to get out on the ramp to talk to employees and the focus very specifically on what they would like to see change. And he heard it at every location that he went to and it's very healthy for us to receive that feedback. And Oscar had a level of urgency with respect to addressing; getting our employees the tools they need to provide terrific customer service which is at the end of the day his clearly are objective. So I think what you may have read from that perspective into Oscar's comments was a real sense of urgency which we all need to have about ensuring that our employees, our front line employees are able to provide the level of service that they would like to provide and in some respect we really acknowledge that we can do better and we are working very hard on that. But I wouldn't misinterpret Oscar's desire to create urgency in that area which is appropriate with an outcome perspective to disconnect between our front line employees and management so we are very focused on it and we expect to continue to move forward with the momentum that Oscar brought in that area. As relates to the management team, look this is added score, this is a team that has been here through first quarter which resulted in record results, and the second quarter which was already in record results and the third quarter which we resulted in a record results. We would expect -- you would expect every new CEO to come and evaluate his management team that is the CEO's prerogative, any changes that are made are based upon what's perceived as we needed and in parts what that CEO perceives that he or she need. So I don't think that's out of the ordinary for a new CEO. I'll tell you that the team that we have here now is fully capable of and well in fact execute the plan to rest of this year. And we feel very confident about that and we feel very confident about our ability to continue to connect with the front line employees and move forward as the unified organization. ","Jamie Baker ","Excellent. I appreciate that. Second question follow up with Jim on domestic pricing. How much stronger are pricing trends in markets where discounters do not file fair's than in the O&D where they do and the reason I ask the question is that I am trying to assess whether domestic revenue pressures are a function solely of discounter influence or perhaps there's also room for pricing improvements in markets where discounters do not have an influence, any color on that?","Jim Compton","Hey, Jamie, Jim. Yes, clearly the competitor pricing pressures that we talked about in Houston, Dallas and Chicago continue and so it is -- those competitor pricing pressures are more isolated in those markets. I would add that the energy sector becomes a little bit more spread both international and the domestic where we have seen that demand. But outside of that we see good demand, relatively -- relative to -- obviously energy relatively strong demand and so I think that as we manage price relative that demand we will continue to do that. And but I think there is a strong demand outside those markets that you refer to. ","Operator","From Stifel we have Joseph DeNardi on line. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you. Brett, just on your comments about closing the margin gap between you and your peers, I guess your few innings into on the cost side and a fuel adjusted basis margin having a close much so, is the story here that you just have to wait for Houston and domestic yields in the Pacific to get better before the gap starts to close or what are the main levers over the next 24 months that you see closing that gap?","Jim Compton ","Well, clearly this is Jim. Clearly the energy is putting pressure on us. And so as that sector moves and whether it softens a little bit more and begin to improve that will obviously have an impact on us because the corporate energy business and that sector and our hub in Houston is very much affected by that business. In terms of growing margins from a networks perspective, I separate that because the networks on a past as I saw as we kind of refer to what we are doing with two cabin aircraft becoming less depended on regional jets that are up gauging strategy is very much a margin accretive strategy. And so --and we are going to continue -- that is our path to continue into 2016. In addition that up gauging just a piece of that is slimline activity that we began this year. Remember that we've talked about it before, it comes out of $0.04 to $0.06 rise depending on the fleet in the market and it comes out of about $0.01 to $0.02 CASM depending on the market, very much margin accretive. So I think would summarize is that being the team's initiative going forward are to continue to drive incremental margin and we are really confident that we can do that. There are some extra things obviously such as the energy that put pressure on that. But we are moving forward, the network will continue to contribute to that. ","Gerry Laderman","Yes. Joe, it is Gerry. On the cost side, keep in mind that brings next year as we continue with project quality initiative. We hit that run rate of $1 billion, that's couple hundred million incremental to this year, so there is some real benefit there. We got to continue de-leveraging that helps on interest expense and yes don't forget as we continue on the reliability initiatives efficiency is going to drive cost down as well. ","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, thanks for that. And Gerry, I guess just on project quality, just the $200 million in savings expected in 4Q just given the pace that you guys are moving out, how much upside is there to the $1 billion at this point and then if you could just -- is there an interest expense target that you think is appropriate for next year just given the de-leveraging?","Gerry Laderman","On project quality, it is too soon to tell kind of pace going forward beyond the initial initiative. We'll have more color I think when we start our talking about 2016 cost guidance in January. But I can tell you that nobody is stopping. The $1 billion will reach and the sort of the sensible cost management culture is embedded in everyone's DNA here, so we will continue with those efficiencies. As Jim said, as we update we are going to get some benefits there on the cost side as well. So we will have more color for you into next year. But we are hopeful of that, that we will continue with the progress we've made. ","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Then just on the interest expense, is there a target, do you think you guys can get to next year?","Gerry Laderman","Not really. We're not going to that yet. Will take a look at so where the opportunities are there and will have more color on that in January.","Operator","And our last question from Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora on line. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hey, good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the question. I guess my first question for Jim certainly appreciates all the color around what you're seeing in China right now. It seems like from booking standpoint you aren't seeing much of a change. But with the capacity increases you noted I guess will unit revenues in the region get worse before they get better or do you see -- can you continue sequential improvement on the Pacific like you're seeing from a system wide perspective?","Jim Compton","Hey, Andrew, Jim. Obviously that capacity if you think about China, by itself that capacity does put pressure on unit revenue and we see that 35% growth in the fourth quarter. But on the other hand demand is growing strong but as I mentioned on the couple sources of that demand whether it is traffic that's making, it is also the US over other connecting points or the economies stimulating it. So we are filling much of that capacity and as you think about going forward the Chinese carriers continue to use the rights and as we move beyond 2016 given the current allocation of right we should begin to see that capacity growth debate.","Andrew Didora","Great, thank you for that. And my follow-up question. I guess at this time, are you willing to say when you think you could get back to a flat system wide PRASM?","Jim Compton","Andrew, this is Jim. I am not. I talked a little bit about kind of the pieces that are moving, foreign exchange that giving current levels of foreign exchange, the negative impact of PRASM will begin to fully lap in the second quarter. The lower surcharges will lap fully in the second quarter given where they are at today. The energy business is the one that we are watching really, really closely. We've seen it soften a little bit more from the second quarter and we talked about being 35% down in the third quarter. Compare to -- based on the pricing structure today that would lap itself in the third quarter of next year. So it is difficult to pinpoint when that PRASM would be flat year-over-year. But we think those pressures, those negative pressures begin to update as we move towards that. And the last piece is that, as I mentioned on earlier comments that we are going to keep our eye on demand. Demand at the beginning of this year expectations were to be greater than what we've seen. And so it makes it difficult to pinpoint that. But as I mentioned in my comments we do see that quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement as we head towards growing PRASM. ","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analysts and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Reuters we have Geoffrey Dunstan. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Dunstan","Thank you very much. Brett how does your vision or the initiatives you will introduce to realize that vision differ at all from Mr. Munoz's vision or initiatives? ","Brett Hart","Hi, Geoffrey. They don't differ at all. We have plan in place and we are going to work execute that plan over the course of the next couple of months to finish out this fiscal year. Oscar's focus and what he brought to us during the time that he was here, and was a renewed focus on our customers, on getting our employees the tools they need to succeed in provide excellent customer service. Making sure that our systems and processes are geared towards those objectives and he had a very strong focus first and foremost on safety. We are using what he provided in terms of his vision as a lens for executing on our plan for the rest of this fiscal year. So those perspectives are in entirely aligned and there would be no dramatic changes. ","Geoffrey Dunstan","Great, thank you very much. In line with that, what is on the table beside a new tone that will United to conclude contracts with its flight attendants and its maintenance technicians and then if you may, is there anything that's going to be a game changer to the in-flight experience and plans that you are guys taking now. ","Brett Hart","So on the first part of that question; we remain very focused on achieving joint collective bargaining agreements. And we think that Oscar's focus again was on connecting immediately with our front line employees and with our labor leaders. And we will continue that process. So and obviously towards achieving agreements that are fair to or employees and fair to the company over the long run. So we remain focused on that. In terms of the in-flight experience I'll allow Greg to -- Greg or Jim to provide perspective on that. ","Jim Compton","Hey, Geoffrey, Jim. On the products, let me jump on the products side and I think what you are going to see is when I think call it cadence and we have been doing a deep review of our product and quite frankly listening to our customers and our employees being involved in that conversation about different things we can do. So it is cadence and I would say that we are down to three choices of premium coffee. And that was something we heard loud and clear. And I think we are really, really closet. We kind of go through that process bringing our employees quite frankly into that process and our customers are going to enjoy that so forth. It is small example of cadence that you are going to see across the company. Relatively quickly I want to say this is going to come slowly. And recognizing our best customers, our flight attendants today are doing a terrific job of offering a free drink to some of our best customers in the economy cabin when they don't get their upgrade. So that's another example of cadence of things from a product point of view. I put all that we have a number of product things happening. Whether as to continuation of rolling out Wi-Fi, whether it's the reconfiguration of our aircraft and growing flatbed seats, newer San Fran and newer LA will be100 flatbed seat beginning on October 25 with our PS service in New York. So a number of product things are going to be happening as well as the things that we are hearing from our customers and employees. ","Operator","And our last question from the Associate Press, we have David Koenig. Please go ahead.","David Koenig","I was going to ask pretty much the same thing about the in-flight experience. How quickly are you going to have more details on that? There were some reference to some other initiatives coming out and maybe some guidance in January. When do you expect to have more details on anything additional on in-flight experience? ","Jim Compton","More details. Over the next week and we will be starting -- we will announce more of those details. So again it is a cadence that a cadence as we can implement them. Some items take longer to implement and planning. But as we move through the next several weeks and through the end of the year. You will hear many of those details. ","David Koenig","And anything you can say more on the boarding process? I mean that's something that carriers constantly ticker with, is it just part of that fleet that's giving you problem or you are looking at everything and what might you change?","Jim Compton","It is interesting after all who is looking at the boarding process because that's one of the things quite frankly that we hear a lot about and how we can improve it. And we are actually doing some testing of that boarding process here in O'Hare beginning this week, changes to it. So nothing to announce yet but again an example of that. There is a lot of activity happening based on what we are hearing from our employees and what from customers. So you will hear more on that where we describe how that testing went. But we are going to try -- you will hear will be experimenting with some different boarding process, give some better details and how we can improve that. ","David Koenig","Can you say what you are testing? ","Jim Compton","I am sorry.","David Koenig","Can you say what you are testing? ","Jim Compton","I won't because the testing is literally starting this week. I will encourage people to walk by BA in O'Hare and you can see that testing live if you are hitting one of the time periods we are doing it.","Jonathan Ireland","Brandon, this will conclude our call. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call me at relations if you have any further questions. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Good bye.

Our earnings per share excluding special charges was 5.4% higher than last year at $2.75. We reported pretax earnings of $1.3 billion, with a pre-tax margin of 13.2%. Both of those of course are excluding special charges. Total revenue was 6.4% in the second quarter. This is the highest level of quarterly revenue that we\u2019ve had since the fourth quarter of 2013. Also in this quarter, we repurchased $422 million of stock at an average price of $74 per share. Secondly, on the operational side, we finished this quarter as the Number One airline amongst our largest competitors in completion, on-time departures and on-time arrival. This is the first quarter United\u2019s operation has finished Number One among our peers since the merger and we look forward to continuing to build on this momentum in the second half of the year.","We've also made meaningful strides and are executing on ten changes we announced in April on the customer service area and so to better serve those customers and really empower our employees, and so the initial results are very encouraging, specifically around the issue of involuntary denied boarding. Since we put different things into inception back a couple of months ago, we\u2019ve achieved almost 85% reduction in involuntary denied boarding. So that's a good metric that we\u2019re monitoring across the board. And it's important to make the point that these changes amount to a lot more than just a policy shift. Really is more of a, you know, I\u2019m going to use the term paradigm shift in our culture and mindset of our employees and our management. So it\u2019s about providing our people with tools, but also the imperative to solve problems kind of in the moment for our customers. And so we're excited about those developments and you\u2019ll hear more coming from us soon.","And during the quarter we also continued to execute on our strategic initiatives that we laid out at Investor Day last fall with a primary objective of improving our absolute and relative margin performance. We feel incredibly good that we're on the trajectory that we laid out at Investor Day and so it\u2019s a solid path for us that we\u2019re very excited about.","So with that I'll turn it over Scott to discuss both ops and the revenue environment.","Scott Kirby","Thank you Oscar and thanks everyone for joining us today. I'm going to start by talking about our operation. With all the decks and slides that we've created in the past year, for those of us at the United team, this is probably our favorite. You can clearly see that in the second quarter, United ran the very best operation amongst our largest competitors. It was true across the board, with great departure performance, on-time arrivals, completion factor and mishandled baggage rate. We just couldn\u2019t be more proud and thankful to the United team for the incredibly reliable operation. And this improvement is coming from all parts of the company. It starts from getting blank to the gate, ready to fly on time and while we don't traditionally show you a lot of tech op statistics, our maintenance team is doing a great job with margin improvement in tech ops metrics that I recall seeing at any airline, anytime, anywhere during my career.","At the airport, our agents and ramp team are turning airplanes and getting them out on time. You can see our industry leading departure performance, but dig a little deeper and you\u2019d find an almost 100% improvement in quick turn performance and many other metrics showing huge year-over-year improvement. Globally, our ramp team has set new records for mishandled bags in 22 of the last 24 months. And once our customers get on the airplane, our flight attendants are just doing an incredible job. In fact we get more positive feedback on flight attendants then we get feedback on anything else. That\u2019s an amazing statistic and a testament to our great flight attendants. Our pilots are the day to day leaders of the airline on the front line and without that front line leadership none of this would be possible.","And finally, our network operation center has the most difficult job in the industry given our hubs are located and the airports most likely to experience air traffic ground delay program and they do a phenomenal job quarterbacking the entire operation and quickly recovering after air traffic control or weather events. I know some of the investors on this call are really more interested in what I\u2019m going to talk about on revenue, intended to discount operational performance, but great operations are the foundation that a great financial airline is built on. First, over time we will win more customers by being the best operationally. And even in the short term, our CASM performance is much better when we run a good airline as evidenced this quarter by our strong CASM results. So thanks once again to the entire United team and to the operations and leadership led by Greg, who is here in the room with us today.","Turning down to the revenue environment, demand was solid, we performed in line with our passenger unit revenue forecast during the quarter, despite softer than expected demand in the Pacific and despite higher year-over-year completion factor. Kudos also to the cargo team for a 22% increase in revenue in the quarter, with an assist to the operations because one of the keys to winning cargo business is running a good operation and delivering that cargo on time. Our consolidated PRASM was 2.1% higher year-over-year for the quarter, just above the midpoint of our guidance provided in April. All entities except the Pacific were PRASM positive in each month during the quarter.","Domestic revenues were 2.4% year-over-year, a very solid result on 5.6% growth in ASMs. Atlantic performance of 3.3% was better than we forecasted, boosted by strong US point of sale and healthy front-cabin demand. Latin PRASM grew 7.8% year-over-year, driven by the timing of Easter and strength in Brazil, Caribbean, and Mexico beach markets, which more than offset weak performance in the Mexico business market. PRASM in the Pacific was weaker than we initially expected and declined 5.5% this year, worsening from the decline in the first quarter. This result was nearly 400 basis points worse than our initial expectations due to softer demand in China and Hong Kong. Looking forward, we anticipate third quarter consolidated PRASM to be about flat. Domestically, we expect PRASM to be also to be about flat given higher industry ASMs and shifts in holiday timing. The domestic market has absorbed our growth well and we\u2019re pleased with the performance of our new summer flying from a revenue, operational, and financial perspective.","The Atlantic PRASM is also expected to be flat as the demand pattern shifts to European point of sale in July and front-cabin demand is pressed by European vacations in July and August. So that\u2019s being somewhat offset by stronger Europe. The Pacific remains our most challenging region and probably the only region that we\u2019ve seen an actual slowdown in demand. But we are hopeful that a reduction in industry capacity growth by the fourth quarter will help future PRASM results. United capacity growth slowed in the Pacific from 6% in the first half of the year to just under 1 in the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect that retiring our 747 fleet which we\u2019re excited to do, but it will help the second half profitability in the Pacific. Latin PRASM remains a bright spot, but second quarter growth was likely the peak growth rate for PRASM during the year given the Easter tailwind in 2Q. As we get into the back half of the year, comps will start to get a little bit tougher as we lap the start of the Brazil recovery.","Turning to Slide 8, our capacity outlook for the third quarter is up approximately 4%. As it was in the second quarter, we expect that growth to be biased towards higher domestic with an increase of 5.5% to 6.5%. Our full-year outlook for system capacity growth stayed the same at 2.5% to 3% and is consistent with our guidance from March 15. I think everyone probably knows this, but our capacity guidance is based on scheduled capacity. In the first half of the year, our ASM growth ended up higher than we\u2019d originally expected as a result of higher completion factor. We couldn\u2019t be happier to see that because it means running a really good operation is good for our customers and our investors. If this trend does continue in the second half, our full-year capacity growth will be towards the higher end of the range.","On Slide 9, we are delivering on our promises from Investor Day, which includes executing on all of our strategic initiatives. In addition to the great progress we\u2019ve made improving the operational integrity of the airline, we\u2019ve rolled out basic economy fares across our mainland US domestic system and we\u2019re pleased with the initial results and operational manifest that come from fewer - having fewer gate checked bags. We continue to optimize our pricing strategies related to basic economy and we remain confident in the $1 billion contribution from segmentation by 2020.","This summer we added new margin accretive flying in 15 domestic markets and we\u2019ve up gauged five domestic markets from regional to mainland. We're growing faster than any of our major competitors, something that hasn't happened here in a very long time. We're doing this by adding efficient margin accretive flying this summer, 75% of our growth is being driven by gate, with 25% coming from improved fleet utilization. United has unique network opportunities and we are capitalizing on them. Another example of this is our plan to remake several of our hubs, which further improves connectivity in our domestic network. We\u2019ll start with our Houston hub this fall by taking our bank structure from ten to eight. We expect connectivity in this hub will increase dramatically with 50% more connection opportunities in the largest bay on the same number departures per day.","In 2018, we also plan to rebate our Chicago and Denver hubs. Rebating our hub, up gauging the airline, improving utilization during peak period, and adding [indiscernible] already achieved that's why these are unique opportunities for United. On revenue management, we continue to optimize our yield management posture and we\u2019ll roll out the first phase of the Gemini yield management system in late August with a broad rollout in 2018 consistent with our Investor Day plan. We\u2019re off to a great start on making United the best airline in the world. It's working really well so far and we\u2019re optimistic about our opportunity ahead and our ability to continue to improve absolute and relative margin performance. We run the best large airline operation in the nation in the quarter. And we continue to close the margin gap this quarter as we\u2019ve been doing for the past several quarters. United team is truly doing an outstanding job.","With that I'll turn it over to Andrew to review the financial results.","Andrew Levy","Thanks Scott. Yesterday afternoon we released our second quarter 2017 earnings and our third quarter investor update. I'll discuss both our results and outlook at a high level, but please refer to those documents for additional detail. Slide 11 is the summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 12 shows our non-GAAP results. Adjusted earnings per share increased 5.4% to $2.75 and we reported pretax income of $1.3 billion which represented 13.2% pretax margin excluding special charges. ","Turning to Slide 14, nonfuel unit costs increased 3.1% on a year-over-year basis, which is better than our initial forecast of up 4% to 5% mostly due to improved operational performance, higher ASM growth, sustained cost reduction efforts and timing of certain expenses. We expect third quarter CASM x to be higher year-over-year by 2% to 3% and our projected full year 2017 CASM x increase remains unchanged between 2.5% and 3.5%.","Turning to Slide 15, we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of unrestricted liquidity which includes of $2 billion untapped revolver. We are comfortably in excess of our stated liquidity target range of $5 billion to $6 billion. During the second quarter, we generated $1.6 billion dollars of operating and $314 million of free cash flow. We also contributed $160 million to our pension plans and continue to forecast a total contribution of $400 million in the full year of 2017. During the quarter, we repurchased $422 million of our share at an average price for $74 bringing our repurchases in the first half of 2017 to $735 million at an average price of $72 a share. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.1 billion remaining in repurchase authority.","Turning to Slide 16, full-year 2017 CapEx is now projected to be between $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion which is $400 million higher at the midpoint than our prior guidance. The slide provided some details for this increase which includes higher non-aircraft CapEx, more free delivery deposits and used aircraft transaction. Let me give you a little bit of color on each of these categories. We will invest between $200 million and $300 million more than forecasted earlier this year in IT, ground service equipment, facilities and other critical areas of our business. Technology projects are the biggest area of non-aircraft CapEx and we are increasing investment in our digital platforms, applications development and strengthening our technology infrastructure.","On the fleet side, there are two buckets driving higher CapEx. First $50 million more in PDPs, represent the net impact from a number of changes to our new aircraft order book. The deferral of the first four A350 aircraft out of 2018 to later periods is accounted for in our new projection. Please note that today we will have no further updates to provide about our A350 order. Second, $150 million is related to the purchase of 21 narrowbody aircraft off lease. These include 737NGs, A320 Series aircraft and 757s which have an average age of 21 years. We expect to reliably operate these aircraft for many years to come. The acquisition of used aircraft will be difficult to forecast since these transactions will most often times be opportunistic. We expect this will continue to be an important part of our fleet strategy and we\u2019ll effectively reduce average fleet CapEx.","We continue to expect 2017 to the high watermark for CapEx and expect 2018 CapEx to be approximately $1 billion lower. We will provide a more refined 2018 forecast later this year. Lastly, Slide 17 as the summary of our current guidance including third quarter\u2019s projected fuel price range using the July 13 curve. The range provided for capacity, revenue and costs imply a third quarter pretax margin of between 12.5% and 14.5%. In conclusion, we are pleased with the results in the first half of 2017 and remain confident in our ability to continue to drive earnings improvement. We are managing the business to maximize margins and are focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining the call today. And I will now turn it back to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thanks, Andrew. And again, one just quick last shout out to the energy and enthusiasm of our employees who made such a strong quarter possible. And so with that let\u2019s turn it back over to Julie and we\u2019re happy to take your questions.","Julie Stewart","Thank you Oscar. First we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if need one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you Julie, and the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And from Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay in the line. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","So Scott, you said that Denver is your most profitable hub, obviously it looks like Frontier has announced a pretty big growth push there with the - I think they\u2019ve called it natural share. I\u2019d be curious to have sort of your early take away of what that means for you guys there and if you care to talk about how you might deploy basic economy that means just fee, that is just sort of the first sort of like production test of that product or just any broad thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you.","Scott Kirby","Sure, thanks Hunter. In the near to medium term, anytime we have capacity growth from anyone but particular a low cost carrier it\u2019s going to lead to some pricing pressure. Over the longer term however I view this really having watched the ULCC growth over the last decade this is the best news that I\u2019ve heard in the last ten years. I have known and look, what they said is, they\u2019re going to run a connecting hub-and-spoke network in Denver. The model that they used to have which led them to bankruptcy, but they\u2019re pivoting from what has been the most successful models, point to point ULCC strategy around the world to going back to trying to copy what the network carriers do and run it connecting business model.","And the reason I view that is that best thing that has happened in the last decade is because I believe for many years that the ULCC business model can\u2019t work when a network carrier decides to compete on price and particularly once we\u2019ve been able to roll out based economy. And while I believe that for a long time this is the first I guess public validation that one of the ULCCs is throwing in the towel on the point-to-point business model and switching to a network model. And look that\u2019s a lot more complicated. It's one thing to run a point-to-point network, but when you're trying to run connecting traffic, you got to slow down the aircraft utilization because you got to wait for passengers and employees to connect and airplanes to be timed correctly.","You got to staff up, because you have peaks and valleys, you got to connect bags, which is one of the most operationally difficult thing we do. Today if Frontier has a flight from Orlando to Denver and it\u2019s delayed by two hours, all they have to do is run the flight two hours, but the customers still get there and it\u2019s not a good experience, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. Tomorrow when they\u2019d have half the people in that airplane that are connecting, if that flight is two hours late, their choice and they got one flight a day to all these markets, do we delay everything else for the rest of the day by two hours or do we have half the people on that airplane go to a hotel and spend the night or do we buy [indiscernible] half of the people in that airplane tickets on United to get them to their destination that day.","It is exponentially more complex to run a connecting model. And for Frontier to publically acknowledge that the old business model has run out of growth opportunities in the middle of an IPO process I just view as a phenomenal validation of everything we've done has worked and our ability to compete and win against them. And I can promise you they\u2019re not competing on our turf and trying to get a network carrier in Denver, that is a battle I guarantee United will win.","Hunter Keay","Thank you for that thorough answer Scott, I appreciate it. A question for either you or Andrew, I suppose on this whole zero based budgeting concept. I think you know there's some success and there's some failure - stories of failure out there around that concept. I think like Heinz for example one of the worst places where it didn't work like that was supposed to. So it\u2019s not always the slam dunk. Can you talk to me about sort of lessons learned that you have seen from your own experience with it, what maybe you've learned from other industries and if it works does this represent incremental cost upsides to what you laid out at the Analyst Day or is that considered as a long-term guide? Thank you.","Andrew Levy","Sure, again hey Hunter, I think what you're alluding to is the fact that we're going to - we're starting a, we\u2019re calling it a bottoms up budgeting process as we get ready to budget 2018. Look, I view this really simply as a way to understand the business at a greater depth of detail instead of just simply looking at changes year-over-year in terms of expenditures. We need to revisit the expenditures that we spend the year and make sure that everything we're spending money on continues to make sense. So it\u2019s a big of a mind shift and it's a bit of a just a change in the way of thinking about the business. We're not approaching this with any particular cost savings target in mind. ","But I do believe that in scrutinizing our cost at a higher degree of detail throughout the organization that we will in fact find opportunities to save money along the way. But this is a journey, it\u2019s going to take time and it's a different way of going through the budgeting process. So unlike Heinz or some of the other examples, where perhaps the goals were more short-term oriented and removing cost from the business, I think that will just simply be an output overtime as we get more proficient looking at our cost base and that process is going to start this fall. Actually we've already started that process now, so.","Oscar Munoz","And Hunter, this is Oscar. With regards to experience in other industries and I\u2019ve done it in telecom, I\u2019ve done it in railroads, I\u2019ve done in soft drinks. I just think it as Andrew outlined, this is a normal process that companies go through and now that we're running better, we\u2019ve always talked about taking out some of the safety cushion in operations is one area. So we are very cognizant of both the great trust we\u2019ve built with our employees and with our customers and we're not going to be silly about a cost structure there and just about making sure we do normal things that businesses do. So we\u2019re excited about that possibility that Andrew will lead.","Operator","From Bank of America we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Scott, you mentioned, it\u2019s in the slide deck and in your prepared remarks that the new summer capacity in efficient and performing well. Are there any metrics that you can provide to help us understand this because I think the point gets lost a bit given that that 3Q PRASM and margin guide would suggest otherwise.","Scott Kirby","Well, I guess I\u2019d start with your back part of that. I don\u2019t think that the pre-3Q PRASM or margin guidance suggest otherwise. And look as we move from -- what I guided really reflecting as we moved from 2Q to 3Q, one, on a sequential basis, there are a bunch of calendar things that are probably a point [indiscernible] just calendar issues. That of course is an industry issues but you know not have a or Easter being in the second quarter, with movement of the Jewish holidays in the third quarter, timing of the Easter, just even the day of the week there is extra Friday in the second quarter, extra Saturday in the third quarter, all those things are a point. ","And then we also got industry capacity ramping up particularly in the second half of August and into September at the off-peak period and so our guide is really reflecting those things. Our capacity increased, just started, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come up with some more things to share but only been flying for six to seven weeks it\u2019s a little early to have anything definitive and share with you but I\u2019m sure we can come up with something to talk about more in the future, but look you can just look at this quarter from a margin perspective, we\u2019ll only got one airline to compare to, but at least stripping out the hedge losses, we have in fact [indiscernible]. ","It\u2019s the fifth straight quarter that we\u2019ve closed the margin gap that\u2019s pretty good track record. And we just feel really good about how well this is going. I\u2019m particularly proud of the ops team because switching from a slow growth or no growth mode to growth is not easy operationally and we've done that. At the same time our team is putting up absolute records in terms of operational performance. So really across the board we're excited about how things have played out so far and very optimistic about the future.","Andrew Didora","And just my second question, Andrew, I know our CapEx will be down to $1 billion next year. But I think it still implies a tick-off from your prior $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion guide. Is this just a change in the order book that you've announced over the past few months or is there something else in there to think about in 2018?","Andrew Levy","Andrew, it's really nothing to do with the order book. It's really more of an - well, first of all let me start out by saying that we want to give you directionally rough order of magnitude sense of \u201818 versus \u201817. And I think in the comments I made, I did state that we will give you a more refined estimate later this year. But it's just rough order of magnitude I think the main difference is just a higher level of non-aircraft CapEx expenditures, we think that some of the investments that I touched on as far as categories and investment that that will continue next year and that\u2019s our expectations as we sit here right now. So it really doesn't tie into the new order book and I don't expect any changes in the new order book that would affect 2018 CapEx to occur between now and the end of the year.","Operator","From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","Scott, does the guidance embed continued strength in operational performance or are you assuming that you normalize to something that you perhaps achieved over say a longer period of time versus the second quarter?","Scott Kirby","I not only made it explicit to something, either on RASM or CASM about continued operational performance. It\u2019s sort of a continuation of the trends from a RASM perspective. So I guess that would implicitly assume that operations continued to run well. Really doing things on a sequential basis. And from a CASM perspective, I\u2019ll let Andrew talk about anything on CASM.","Andrew Levy","I think we made some assumptions about how meetings certain targets would affect profit sharing or operational bonuses that are based on meeting certain targets. We do expect to continue to operate the airline at a similar high level that we\u2019ve been as far as estimating a higher completion factor. We really haven't taken that into account on a go forward basis.","Darryl Genovesi","And any rough thoughts towards your 2018 capacity plan at this point?","Scott Kirby","Not yet.","Darryl Genovesi","I mean have you filled out all of the catchment area flying, the stuff that you weren\u2019t already serving that you\u2019ve added this year. Would you say that process is largely complete?","Scott Kirby","No, but you shouldn\u2019t try read anything into that about 2018 capacity.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank we have Mike Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Mike Linenberg","I just have a couple of fleet questions here. The four A350s, does that represent 100% of your A350 deliveries in \u201918?","Scott Kirby","Yes, it does Mike.","Mike Linenberg","And then just, the dozen MAX aircraft that are being accelerated into 2019, are those MAX 8. And then, if they are, are those types of airplanes in a two class or two plus class, with those airplanes makes sense Transatlantic for you.","Andrew Levy","Mike, let me handle the first part and then maybe Andrew or Scott can talk about the network use of that. First of all, their MAX 9 aircraft, so they are not 8s. [indiscernible] but those MAX 9 aircraft and those 12 aircraft as you recall we deferred 65, well we deferred 61 737-700 airplanes that was about a year ago, we did that less than a year ago. Four of the 65 became 800s, 737-800s which we\u2019re delivering this year. And the balance of the 61 positions had been kind of put out there in the future - in different way out in the future with Boeing. And what we're doing here is that these 12 aircraft are kind of first 12 of those 61 that we've identified a delivery slot and they\u2019re coming in in 2019 as we indicated in the release. So as far as the suitability of the MAX 8 for Transatlantic, I think Andrew is probably going to take that one.","Andrew Nocella","Yeah. I think right now, Mike, we have plenty of 757s in our European configuration that are flying around in the domestic system. So I don\u2019t think we have any rush to move into flying 737s across the Atlantic. But it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to look at for the medium to long term. But it\u2019s not something we plan to do in the short term at all.","Operator","From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","I just have a couple of questions. One, I think one of the things that you're doing to improve consumer relations has to do and denied boardings and I think, Oscar, you may have mentioned this as well with the program to encourage passengers to change their flights a few days in advance. And I'm kind of wondering how that\u2019s growing the acceptance of it, whether that's driving more, knowing that they won't be bumped, driving more passengers your way.","Andrew Nocella","Helane, this is Andrew Nocella. We are working on that pilot that does, what you described, we have not implemented it as yet and I would say it\u2019s a pilot. So it\u2019s really small. This is something that we continue to evaluate. We think it\u2019s a great idea for our customers and for United Airlines. So more to come on this if it becomes something substantial, but at this point, we\u2019ll likely launch the pilot in the next few weeks and the total number of passengers being moved in this pilot, you know, if they so desire to move, will probably be in the neighborhood of 50. So it\u2019s really small scale, but we think it\u2019s a great idea and if it works and our customers appreciate it a lot more to come.","Helane Becker","Okay. Great. So we'll look out for that. And then I just have a question on CapEx and IT spend. Airlines were really early adopters of technology and haven't been able to keep pace in part because obviously there were financial issues in the last decade, but I'm kind of wondering as you think about IT spend over the next three or four years, can you just -- of your CapEx budget, should we think about that as being like 10% of the budget? Should we think about it as being a combination of new website, new retail to cut customer outreach in terms of the mobile app and so on as well as system redundancies, so that you don't get caught out with technology issues? Thank you.","Andrew Levy","Sure, Helane. Our technology spend, both this year and going forward I think will be all of the above, everything you mentioned. It\u2019s application development, both customer facing as well as operationally beneficial applications, its infrastructure investments, including disaster recovery. That\u2019s a big part of our spend this year. It is bringing in automation in parts of the business where we\u2019ve had very little of that, including for instance, in our warehouses. We have a project this year we launched where we\u2019re going to start to automate our warehouse, our warehouses in terms of our spare parts inventory. ","And there, I think you\u2019re right, there is a big opportunity to bring technology into the business and allow us to increase our efficiency as a result of taking advantage of that opportunity. I think you\u2019re also right that there are many, many years where we didn\u2019t have the balance sheet or the wherewithal to be able to make these types of investments and we\u2019re fortunate to be in a position where we can change that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and that is, in large measure, why we\u2019re spending more money this year in non-aircraft CapEx projects. As far as the pace of spend, I would assume it will probably be -- probably about a third of aircraft or non-aircraft CapEx will be in the IT arena, as far as capital expenditures, obviously more of it hits the OpEx line.","Operator","From Citi, we have Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey","Maybe Scott, could you talk about corporate, whether it be share or performance relative to leisure in general.","Scott Kirby","Corporate was strong in this quarter with quarter that was \u2013 it was up 6%, our corporate business. That\u2019s not the best metric, I mean, I\u2019ll give it to you, but we can always make corporate going up by just signing more corporate accounts, but we also need the quality of our corporate accounts, but business demand is, I think, certainly, internationally stronger than leisure demand, but corporate demand was strong throughout the quarter.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Savanthi Syth. Please go ahead.","Savanthi Syth","Scott, maybe I can ask you, again, just how should we think about when you start to see the benefits to PRASM from three items. Like one is the kind of the increased amount of market presence. The second one is the basic economy which you just rolled out and then eventually, this Gemini rollout in late August, like when should we think of that showing up in unit revenue or maybe your unit revenue doesn\u2019t perform in line with what you would expect, given comps or capacity?","Scott Kirby","So I\u2019ll make one overarching point that our initiatives, the initiatives you talked about, some of those are, like Gemini is rather specific, but many of those are about margin. And you\u2019re already seeing that, besides the second quarter, you\u2019re going to continue to see it going forward. And I think so those are showing up in PRASM performance, I mean if you look at our second quarter, I mean domestically, bringing up one competitor compared to, but given our growth rate, but then given some of the issues in Delta last year, to be that close I think is really good about the result already. ","On those things, new markets was the first line you mentioned. Those aren\u2019t on day one RASM accretive. You start flying to a new city, takes some time, around, but we typically think of that as about, on a domestic city, 6 to 12 month ramp-up for you to kind of get to full benefit. Gemini, [indiscernible], we already have some yield management benefits, but they\u2019re not really in the system. I think they really just started in the first quarter this year. On the system, we\u2019re going to have to rollout the first part of the new system in end of August, but I wouldn\u2019t expect meaningful changes to revenue for a little while. And even when we do let out to the full system, those kinds of changes, yield management system, with the kind of changes and sometimes they take one step back to take two steps forward, because you turn off an old system that\u2019s [indiscernible]. ","That process is going to start in August and in basic economy, we\u2019ve got basic economy rolled out across the system, but we\u2019ve been for the last couple of months, one of our big competitors essentially has it rolled out. They\u2019ve done it in less than 1% of their system and there is a bunch of places that we\u2019ve been uncompetitive from a pricing perspective. We haven\u2019t been -- normally, we worry a lot about pricing competitiveness in the near term, we\u2019ve been willing to be uncompetitive on price in the short term, as we try to get this sorted out for what it\u2019s going to look like for the next 20 years instead of worrying about the next two months. ","But I think by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have a position where everyone of the big network fares presumably will have rolled out basic economy around their system and at that point, I think basic economy will be more of a tailwind. It\u2019s less of a tailwind right now, because on some of our competitors, the standard, you can get the standard product on our competitors for the same products that we get the basic product on United Airlines. That won\u2019t be the case in the long run, but in the near term, we get benefits from selling up more customers, but I\u2019m sure we lose some share as a result of that as well.","Savanthi Syth","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And if I may, just really quick. I wonder if there is an update on -- earlier this year, there was an announcement about kind of investing in Avianca, in Avianca Brasil, and kind of deepening the partnerships there. Is there any kind of progress on the investment or any kind of strategic initiatives related to that?","Scott Kirby","There is lots of progress, but none of them which we can talk about on the call today. We are fitting in to work with partners and we appreciate the, all of our Latin American partnerships and we hope to be able to have something to announce in the not-too-distant future.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Scott, actually a question for you, a higher level one, there have been quite a few developments since your Investor Day last year, can you just talk about some of the pluses and minuses since then that make it easier or harder for you to narrow the margin gap and meet some of the other commitments.","Scott Kirby","I\u2019ll give it a shot. We, on the plus side, feel like we\u2019re executing really well on all the initiatives that we talked about. We\u2019ve done more work in yield management than we initially intended. We\u2019ve grown more confident on basic economy, particularly when it rolled out everywhere. We -- the network stuff is a little, some of the rebanking is a little delayed as we got through the operational, making sure we can handle it operationally. As for the plus side, the operation is running better than it ever has in history and as I said earlier on, it\u2019s the thing we\u2019re probably the most proud of that really is a great foundation to build on the rest of the airlines. In the near term, so most of the things are going on plan or a little bit better than plan. ","In the near term, if there has been a headwind, geography is a headwind for us, that has nothing to do with margin gap closure. But for example, in the second quarter, if we just had applied our RASM performance to the Delta geography, that\u2019s what we know right now, our RASM would have been seven-tenths of a point better. I mean that really is, we have big exposure to China and less exposure to domestic. And so with China doing worse, and domestic is doing better, we\u2019re going to underperform on the system private level, not because we\u2019re performing, but just because we have bad geography. Those things ebb and flow, so we don\u2019t really think of those as margin gap one way or another, because one quarter [indiscernible] pretty good about the trajectory that we\u2019re on.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then actually Scott on the international front, as we move beyond the next quarter or two and I think you\u2019re kind of alluding to this, where do you think the best opportunity is and how sustainable was some of the flattish PRASM we\u2019ve seen, just given how much we\u2019ve already improved over the last year or two?","Scott Kirby","Well, for United, we have more modest growth plans internationally. Our international network is fantastic. We are the best international network in the business. I think we have the most, highest profit margins in the business. Latin America is obviously recovering quickly. We\u2019ve added some capacity there. We\u2019re going to start our service. We\u2019ve added a little bit in Europe. Obviously, Asia is the most challenged. I suspect we\u2019ll continue to grow, but not grow quickly on the international line and our growth will kind of depend on what\u2019s happening geography by geography. So it\u2019s hard to predict this more in advance what Asia is going to be doing two years from now versus what the Americas is going to be doing two years from now. But I would anticipate modest growth at a much lower rate than the domestic growth.","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joe DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joe DeNardi","Scott, just given the partnership that you guys have with Chase, I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk to what you guys are seeing in terms of an impact from their rollout of higher reserve card, what that\u2019s meant for your business in terms of spend and card acquisitions and maybe what you\u2019re doing to make sure that the value your card offers consumers remains competitive?","Scott Kirby","Look, we\u2019re having an awful lot of discussions with Chase. And we appreciate the partnership with Chase. We\u2019ve gotten more engaged at a high level. So I have now a quarterly meeting with Gordon who runs the card portfolio at Chase and I believe that this should be upside in the future for us. It is one of the areas where we are currently underperforming, both Delta and American is probably a full margin point, it\u2019s not a point and a half, the kind of performance that they\u2019re getting. But this is about partnership and about making, getting to the world that\u2019s a win for Chase and a win for United Airlines. ","We have done that before, we\u2019re fortunate to have the management sitting next to me, Andrew Nocella who led those efforts at my last airlines and American has got a huge tailwind right now from the deal with the city and they have a great partnership with them. I believe we\u2019re going to get, didn\u2019t happen overnight and I believe we\u2019re going to get there and I believe that Chase is committed to that and that we\u2019re going to get to a win with them. But I\u2019m not sure when we\u2019re going to be able to have the kind of tailwinds that American and Delta have had, but I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll get there, this is one thing that we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time talking about, because we can\u2019t do it alone, but I think the motivation is in the right place with our partners and that we will ultimately get a much better result out of the card, which will be good for United, good for Chase and good for our customers.","Joe DeNardi","And then maybe just switching gears a little bit, I think there have been a number of things that have kind of improved the cyclicality of the business, but maybe one thing working against it is this, what seems to be a shift towards more corporate traffic away from leisure. I\u2019m just wondering Scott or Andrew, if you could talk about historically, how, what the share of corporate traffic now is versus ten years ago and what that means for cyclicality?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatically different. It\u2019s focused on these earnings calls, more than anywhere else. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dramatically different. If you look at the places where it\u2019s important like across Atlantic, but then you got leisure markets like Hawaii that are gaining more. And so there are puts and takes.","Andrew Levy","The only thing I will add is, I think we\u2019re seeing strong premium performance across the globe other than Asia at this point.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Well, nice segue from Chase. First question for, that wasn\u2019t deliberate, was it? First question, I know it\u2019s in my wallet. First question for Andrew, look, the third quarter guide, I mean, it\u2019s being met with disappointment by the market. My assumption is that if we set fuel to decide, your 2017 earnings plan is coming in a bit below what the \u201917 plan was last November. My first question is whether or not that is the case, but more importantly assuming the things are coming in a bit below plan, can you point to what adjustments you\u2019ve made in order to potentially get back on track? I mean, two, three, four initiatives that are incremental?","Andrew Nocella","Well, Jamie, I guess, we start by maybe that we don\u2019t agree with that view. I don\u2019t think any of us feel that we\u2019re off track in 2017 at all, even if you exclude the fact that fuel is indeed lower than what we thought it would be at the beginning of the year. I think the biggest difference we\u2019ve seen on the revenue side is what\u2019s been discussed already, which is weakness in the Pacific, China specifically, that fleet was not expected. That\u2019s the only thing so far that we\u2019ve seen that is a surprise. On the cost side, everything is progressing as expected. So no, I think we\u2019re kind of hitting on all cylinders and doing everything we thought we\u2019d do.","Jamie Baker","Okay. A question for Scott and I guess this builds a little bit on the theme of Savanthi\u2019s question, but I\u2019m curious what the basic economy RASM contribution is as it relates to the third quarter guide for flat domestic RASM. We were assure the basic economy was going to be immediately accretive, at least I think that\u2019s what you said. So I\u2019m wondering if that has proven to be the case, it would suggest that absent basic economy, your domestic RASM would actually be going down and I\u2019m not sure that I understand what that would be?","Scott Kirby","So, on basic economy, I do expect it will be RASM accretive and immediately RASM accretive with its competitive product. And we said that exactly in the past, but that would have been the underlying assumption that it was going to be competitive and expected our competitors to get the full workout, but currently, they have taken longer. I still think they\u2019re going to get there, but in the near term, you know, the upside that we get from upsell is offset, it\u2019s impossible for us to make sure, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s offset to a larger, maybe a complete degree by share shift. And so if we\u2019ve been through any of the forecast, it\u2019s probably what our competitors are going to do. We don\u2019t know that. We can\u2019t control that. And we\u2019ll get bigger benefits once we roll that everywhere.","Operator","From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. And sorry if it comes off as critical, but we\u2019re trying to be constructive here. So I guess we might disagree because you guys have been talking about a lot of margin accretive capacity additions, economy basic rollout, yield management. Yet, margins sequentially are looking about flat. Your competitors are up a little bit. So when we think about those initiatives that you guys laid out back in November, with 1.8 billion of incremental earnings expected this year, how can investors start to measure when that\u2019s actually going to gain traction when you guys can really start showing some improvement on the profitability of the business?","Scott Kirby","Look, I think we\u2019re five quarters in a row of closing the margin gap. Your forward-looking, I guess I am going to assume you\u2019re comparing to one airline, which has given the guidance for the third quarter, which is Delta. And we knew and could have known and everyone could have known all along that the third quarter was likely to be a year-over-year headwind. I mean, Delta that self described, hit the RASM in last year\u2019s third quarter from IT, there are IT meltdowns and related other issues. And so pricing issue at Delta last year, which I don\u2019t know for sure what the number was, I would guess it\u2019s another 50 basis points and so those things are uniquely third quarter year over year comp issues that are nothing about the trend line, nothing about margin gap closure. ","We\u2019ve had five straight quarters of closing the margin gap and we feel really good about that. That\u2019s a metric you should look at us on. It\u2019s not going to be every quarter. Sometimes, it\u2019s going to be quarter-over-quarter things that happened this year or last year. Sometimes, it\u2019s going to be geographical changes. If China goes gangbusters all of a sudden, we\u2019ll outperform more. If China is bad, that kind of widens the gap. It goes on to the kind of initiatives we talked about at the Investor Day, so we feel really good about what\u2019s happened in the last year and the trajectory going forward.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. I appreciate that Scott. I mean, you guys have these initiatives ramping to 3.2 billion of incremental earnings improvement, I mean, how do we think about those numbers relative to your earnings down here and I get it, that\u2019s -- those were not net of cost inflation and some labor deals, but your investors are looking for that earnings improvement, when should we expect it and I guess just coming back to the earlier question, what are some things that could change in the future if that traction doesn\u2019t develop?","Scott Kirby","Well, I think kind of, I guess to answer the question, when we say 3.2 billion of earnings improvement, we\u2019ve been saying compared to what it would have been without the initiatives. That\u2019s not and never said, 3.2 billion compared to whatever the baseline was, 2015 or anything else. And so, things like fuel price changes, things like new labor deals, things like industry revenue conditions change that baseline. It really is about being on a trajectory to close relative margin gap as much as anything. It\u2019s probably the best way to measure those things and absolutely margin gap. And we\u2019ve been doing that and we expect to continue doing that going forward. That\u2019s the best way to measure it though.","Operator","From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Can you talk about the linkage if there is any between planned growth at United and margin expansion for the company, not anything relative, but just getting your margins back to a trajectory of up year over year? I mean obviously, growth makes unit cost look a little bit better and makes employees happy, but what is the point of growing faster than GDP, faster than your peers while your margins are still declining?","Scott Kirby","Well, look, it sounds a broken record, but we continue to close the margin gap on each quarter. We did this quarter as well. And yeah, we had big pay increases for our people year-over-year, something we\u2019re really proud of, really happy, something that they deserve. That was the right thing to do. And implicit in your question is somehow growth, I don\u2019t think growth is going to either overcome that and if growth wasn\u2019t overcoming that, it shouldn\u2019t have grown. We were more profitable. We had a higher margin this quarter than we would have absent growth, and so we feel really good about where we are, not sure what\u2019s going to happen with the macro environment from a revenue perspective or from a fuel price perspective, we do know that the big pay increases which were great are in the past and so we\u2019re starting to overlap those things. But we\u2019re still going to be subject to what happens from exactly just macroeconomic stuff.","Operator","And our last question from Stephens, we have Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins","So I guess looking forward for a moment, Scott, in reference to your comment around comps getting more challenging in the back half of the year, and certainly some of the internal revenue initiatives that I think may take a little bit longer to gain traction than initially expected, but given the state of the overall market, would you expect you guys be able to see positive unit revenues in the fourth quarter, given that comps are materially are more difficult in the 4Q versus the 3Q or is the really weakness in Asia and the difficult comparisons going to make that more difficult to see, unless we see a stepup in industry fundamentals?","Andrew Levy","Yeah. So look, we\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t have any real data for the fourth quarter. So our forecast can really be no better than yours. You\u2019re right, comps get more difficult, but at the same time, this one point calendar headwind, at least, I don\u2019t actually know for sure what the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays are, but at least the Jewish holiday are a tailwind for the fourth quarter. So the calendar does get better for the fourth quarter and we also know that Southwest growth and Southwest Florida\u2019s domestic, it could be a lot slower in the fourth quarter as they retire all their process. So those are two things that are tailwind and the only thing that I can really think of is incremental, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call headwind, but the cost to yield more difficult. So your guess is as good as mine, how those combination of things balance out.","Jack Atkins","And just for a follow-up and it\u2019s kind of going back to the earlier statements around natural share, we can think about sort of the long term capacity growth plans, I guess just conceptually, how do you guys weigh the desire to take back what you view as your natural market share versus the potential for market disruption that that could cause. Clearly, you need to do what\u2019s in the best interest of your company and what you believe to be in the best interest of the company, but in cases where share has been seeded over the years and it could be highly disruptive to gain that back, how do you balance that internally.","Scott Kirby","Look, really a network, it\u2019s different than point to point and the kind of growth we\u2019re doing, it hasn\u2019t been either highly disruptive, I don\u2019t think it will be highly disruptive. We\u2019re not going in and trying to start flying from Miami to Milwaukee and competing head to head with someone. We\u2019re growing in our hubs where we can have the majority of the people on the airplane or connecting traffic and connecting revenues and in few places, we\u2019re going back to having just competitive service in a market like New York to Atlanta where our competitor Delta flies mainland and we\u2019ve downgrades, jets and now we\u2019re back to mainland. I don\u2019t view those things as disruptive, they haven\u2019t been disruptive. And I don\u2019t expect them to be. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From The Street, we have Ted Reed. Please go ahead.","Ted Reed","Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask about the Pacific, Scott. Delta just announced moving to Atlanta, Shanghai. And I just wondered how they\u2019re downsizing in Narita, it affects your overall in Asia?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t know. I read that announcement. I wasn\u2019t sure whether, although we speculated it was -- Narita Shanghai as you\u2019re confirming that. I don\u2019t think I have anything to -- I just read it before I came in here. So I don\u2019t really have anything to say about it.","Ted Reed","But in general, as Narita becomes less important, does that impact you in Asia and in China?","Andrew Nocella","Well, I think we have a great operation in Narita. This is Andrew, Ted. How are you doing? I think we have a great operation in Narita. We have a great partner with ANA and I think I\u2019m really optimistic about Japan over the long run. Right now, the Pacific over the short run is troubled process in terms of RASM as we said over and over again. So we\u2019re going to be really careful, particularly in Shanghai and Beijing over the next 12 months in terms of our capacity deployment to make sure we can move those markets in the right trajectory for a positive RASM outlook. But we\u2019re really confident where we are in the Pacific partners and our hubs and we think we have these leading franchises.","Operator","From Houston Chronicle, we have Andrea Rumbaugh. Please go ahead.","Andrea Rumbaugh","Thanks for taking my question guys. United reported a strong financial and operational quarter, but this can get overshadowed by some of the incidents that have gone viral on social media. And so I just wanted to know how you guys are working to showcase airlines improvement in the era of social media right now?","Oscar Munoz","Andrea, it\u2019s Oscar. I think it\u2019s a continuing task. The advent of social media in our space is particularly notable and I think the best thing that we can do and continue to do is to refine our customer service experience models, training and people and move from there. I think you will see something from us in the next quarter or so as we revamp our social media team by how we respond and just we need to be a little more agile. We\u2019re a big large company and sometimes, we are stuck in past and I think we need to evolve forward, so that we can handle those events fairly quickly. Not just from a management of the media, and its imprint, but of the individuals involved and if we can stick to the issues. So I think it\u2019s an important distinction between just managing or spinning an issue versus actually you know preventing it and solving for it.","Operator","And from FlightGlobal, we have Edward Russell. Please go ahead.","Edward Russell","Yes. I was wondering if you could breakdown your deliveries for 2018, 19 aircraft, could you confirm that and when we take your first Max and your first 787-10?","Scott Kirby","Let\u2019s see. The first 787-10 I believe is 2019, at the end of \u201918, so it will be in service in 2019. The first Max is 20 -- well, the first Max 10 is 2020, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re asking about Max 10 or just Max in general.","Edward Russell","Just first Max in general?","Scott Kirby","2018 is first Max in general. As far as number of deliveries next year, I\u2019m looking at Gerry Laderman here to keep me honest. We may be able to get back to you with an actual number there.","Operator","Thank you. We will now turn it back to our speakers for concluding remarks.","Julie Stewart","Thank you all for joining the call today.

My name is Brendan and I'll be your conference facilitator today. Following the initial remarks from management, we will open the lines for questions.","This call is being recorded and is copyrighted. Please note that no portion of the call may be recorded, transcribed, or rebroadcast without the company's permission. Your participation implies your consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, simply drop off the line.","I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Jonathan Ireland, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com.","Information on yesterday's release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor updates, copies of which are available on our website.","Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are President and CEO, Oscar Munoz; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; and Senior Vice President of Finance and Acting Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. We also have Chief Operations Officer and Executive Vice President, Greg Hart, in the room to assist with Q&A.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you all for joining us today. As we look at the second quarter, we certainly made significant progress and as we continue to execute against our global operations better than our company has actually ever seen and at the same time delivering solid financial performance.","As you can see on the chart, for the second quarter, we recorded a pre-tax profit of $1.4 billion and achieved pre-tax margins of 14.5%. Those are both excluding special items. For the quarter, we earned $2.61 of diluted earnings per share, which once adjusted for taxes, represents a 25% increase year-over-year, and we delivered this result while improving on our initial expectations.","So, clearly, we accomplished a lot and I'm proud of the hard work of the United team. So, let me give you \u2013 give me a minute to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication to providing a positive and reliable experience for our customers. This can be seen as our operation continued to perform at a high level last quarter with our on-time performance improving over 11 points year-over-year, and on the heels of our best ever six month run on on-time arrivals and bag handling, we are now consistently performing at the level that we and our customers expect of us. Our focus has now shifted to maintaining this level of reliability while doing so more efficiently.","We also completed an important milestone in our labor negotiations by reaching a joint tentative agreement with our flight attendants. If that applies, this agreement will bring our 20,000-plus flight attendants on to a single contract, relieving inefficiencies we have experienced over the last several years. And, most importantly, this will be an important step in unifying our airline to one shared purpose: to be the airline we know we can be.","I want to extend a special thank you to the AFA for their dedication and effort in reaching this agreement. As we speak, our flight attendants are participating in road shows and submitting their votes and we look forward to seeing the results in mid-August.","Speaking about flight attendants, training is already underway with them, and many of our other employees in preparation for the December launch of our new United Polaris business class. Discussion Construction has already started on the first Polaris launch in Chicago, production has also started on our new suite-like seats and the first wave of our chef-inspired menus are being finalized. The experience we're creating, as you know, is exactly, what our customers have asked for and we can't wait for you to enjoy yourself starting on the 1st of December.","Now, back to the quarter. We also continued repurchasing our stock, spending approximately $700 million, representing just a little bit over 4% of our shares outstanding and as we announced yesterday, our board has approved an additional authorization for $2 billion.","Many of you have heard me say, I believe in proof not promise. As you can see this quarter, we had many proof points that we're continuing to build a great airline. However, as we mentioned on our June Investor call, this is not enough and we fully acknowledge we aren't yet performing, from a financial perspective, to the level of our and your expectations and we're not standing still. This can be seen on slide five. On our June call, we laid out a description of the initiatives we are currently implementing and are expected to drive over $3 billion in benefit by 2018. If you've not seen our June presentation, I encourage you to go to our website and download.","We expect these initiatives to contribute to driving incremental value and shrinking our margin gap to peers. We'll keep you updated on the progress of these initiatives.","And we're not stopping there. We are currently in the middle of a thorough self-evaluation of all aspects of our business. In particular, as shown on slide six, we are working to identify ways to operate our airline more efficiently now as it's reached top tier reliability. We are also refining the mission of each geographic region, hub and spoke. Additionally, we are implementing a profit-maximizing product and segmentation strategy that best aligns with our customers.","And finally, we have a cost gap to our peers that we're identifying and addressing those costs that are controllable. I am looking forward to presenting this next chapter of United at our fourth quarter Investor Day.","But before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to speak to our future capacity plans. Let me start by saying we acknowledge, truly acknowledge the importance of returning to positive unit revenue, and, of course, we recognize that our future capacity plans directly impact the future PRASM performance. However, we must evaluate what our network is today, and the evolution to ensure that long-term optimization and sustainability of earnings is maintained. At times, this may include adding capacity to strengthen our best performing markets and ensuring we remain competitive. However, we determine that certain clients will not generate sustained profitability; we will then carefully consider modifying that capacity.","Proof of our result is seen in us again reducing full year capacity 0.25 point. We have now reduced our 2016 capacity growth plans by 0.75 point. This is a meaningful demonstration of our responsiveness to the present demand environment, particularly given that our initial guidance have always been responsibly and conservatively disruptive. Our review and analysis won't stop here as we continue to closely evaluate future changes. Going forward, as we adjust our capacity we tend to update shareholders on these modifications.","So, to wrap up, again, I want to thank our employees for another great quarter and a continued focus on our customers and continue to spend a lot of time visiting stations and I can't be more proud of the work they are all doing.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Thanks, Oscar. As you can see on slide eight, our second quarter revenue declined 6.6%, nearly a full point better than our initial expectations primarily due to international yields, 4th of July holiday timing and other initiatives.","With respect to the third quarter, we expect our passenger unit revenue to decline approximately 5.5% to 7.5% year-over-year with domestic and international PRASM to be in those same ranges.","On slide eight, we defined each of the major headwinds we anticipate for the third quarter summing to approximately 3.5 points of drag on PRASM.","I'd now like to explain what we are seeing in the current demand environment. Leisure bookings have been strong as travelers are taking advantage of attractive fare levels and a strong U.S. dollar. Corporate travel bookings in the second quarter were essentially flat with revenue down approximately 3% as corporate yields continue to be pressured.","Looking towards the rest of the year, we expect to see further softening of corporate yields as summer leisure travel subsides. We will closely monitor these effects as they impact our closing yield, high-yield revenue.","On our April earnings call, we provided an outlook for fourth quarter PRASM and I'd like to update you on that today. Due to downward revisions for fourth quarter GDP as well as a growing concern in the pace of corporate yield recovery, our fourth quarter estimates have been revised downward. In response, as you have seen from our announcement yesterday, we are reducing second half capacity to better align with demand.","On slide nine, we show specific actions we have taken in each geographic entity. I'll let you read through the details on your own but rest assured, we are actively managing our network to optimize results in a challenging revenue environment and are seeing the results. For instance, as a result of our capacity reallocation, Houston had the best year-over-year PRASM of any hub in June, followed closely by San Francisco and Denver.","Taking all these regional dynamics into account, with respect to capacity, as can be seen on slide 10, we now anticipate full year capacity to grow between 1% and 1.5%. As Oscar mentioned, we are currently in the process of closely evaluating our capacity for the fourth quarter and 2017.","As I wrap up, I want to reiterate our focus on maximizing profitability throughout our entire network. We are constantly evaluating the revenue and profitability landscape to ensure we have the proper plan in place. We continue to be committed to growing our capacity in line with demand but remain willing and prepared to adjust when necessary.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gerry.","Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jim. A summary of our financial performance can be seen on slide 12 for GAAP financials and slide 13 for non-GAAP financials. Excluding special items, pre-tax earnings were $1.4 billion with a pre-tax margin of 14.5%. Importantly, our earnings per share were $2.61, a 25% improvement year-over-year when adjusted for taxes as we continue to repurchase shares.","Moving to slide 14, non-fuel unit costs for the quarter grew 2.5%, when excluding special charges, profit sharing and third-party expenses. For the third quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs to grow 2.5% to 3.5% and for the full year, we continue to expect unit costs to grow to 2% to 3%, despite reducing capacity by almost 1 point versus initial expectations. This guidance includes the benefits of our annual efficiency savings initiatives from our 2013 cost savings program as well as our recently announced 2016 program. In total, we expect these two programs to drive $400 million of cost benefit when compared to 2015.","This CASM guidance also includes the impact from the three ratified labor agreements reached this year, but does not include any assumptions associated with the tentative agreement we recently reached with our flight attendants. Once ratified, we will provide more specifics on the impact to our cost.","Based on the guidance we have provided for revenue and costs, we expect our pre-tax margin to be between 13.5% and 15.5% for the third quarter. With respect to cash, in the second quarter, we generated approximately $2.5 billion of operating cash flow and $1.8 billion of free cash flow.","As you can see on slide 15, during the quarter we invested approximately $770 million in the business and took delivery of two Boeing 787-9 aircraft and two Boeing 737-800 aircraft. As Oscar mentioned, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our shares in the quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we still have approximately $255 million remaining on our prior $3 billion authorization. Additionally, as announced yesterday, our board has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization.","Returning cash to our shareholders is a core element of our capital allocation strategy. However, this will not be done at the expense of the health of our balance sheet, as maintaining manageable debt levels is critical to running the airline through a variety of economic cycles.","In conclusion, throughout the quarter, we have continued to demonstrate strong cost discipline, a commitment to invest in our business and a desire to reward our shareholders. We believe the plan we have in place positions us well to continue these actions going forward, while allowing us to be nimble and responsive to a changing economic environment.","I'll now turn it back over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Gerry. As you've heard, we've made substantial progress in the second quarter but we know there is more work to do. It has already been quite a busy summer and will continue to be up, for us here at United, as we work to set up our next chapter. I look forward to sharing more of this with you later in the year.","I'd like to close by thanking our customers for flying United. Our operation is running well, our schedules are adapting to meet your needs and our airport and onboard products continue to elevate your flying experience.","Thank you for choosing United and look forward to seeing you on a flight soon. With that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan for Q&A.","Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Oscar. We'll now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to one question. If you'd like to ask another question, please reenter the queue after your question has been addressed. Brendan, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Jonathan. And from UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. I mean, can you just give us a sense of how you are thinking about \u2013 I know it's early but could you give us a sense of how you're thinking about 2017 capacity levels, at least to start the year?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Darryl. This is Jim. Hey, we're not \u2013 we're actually working on our 2017 plans, as I speak right now, and a lot of focus on that. So, it's too early for us to comment specifically on that.","I will say, as we talked about this year and we talked about in the past years, we're focused on keeping capacity in line with demand. So, we're working through that process now and we plan to update you later in the year on what we're going to do in 2017.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, thank you. I'll surprise you with a non-RASM question. Gerry, if you assume that the current field curve and the RASM environment continues into next year, and you plug in some new labor contracts and the step up and CapEx that looks like you guys will have next year, that is the potential that consume most, if not all of your free cash flow next year. So, first of all, can you say whether you agree with that assessment and could you put a finer point on what CapEx looks like next year and how much flexibility you have to manage that down if the RASM environment remains challenging?","Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Joe, one thing I talked before about looking at free cash flow net of aircraft financing, we've had this discussion that rather we choose to lease aircraft or buy aircraft that can make material difference in free cash flow. So, when I am looking at cash and cash allocation, I do take that into account. And we had to finalize our plan to aircraft financing closer to the start of the year, but just kind of looking at where our aircraft CapEx next year is and kind of what we did this year, I think it's reasonable to assume have a range of about half to two-thirds of our aircraft CapEx being financed next year. So you could probably plug that into your number. It could be a little bit less, it could be a little bit more depending on interest rates but in the current interest rate environment, as you've seen us and others do, the capital markets are quite attractive. So, that's one lever we have sort of depending on the environment how much of our aircraft CapEx is financed.","In terms of other levers, we can always dial down non-aircraft CapEx. We've had reasonable experience doing that. Aircraft CapEx, the only comment I would make is that it tends to be the case that when a manufacturer is building an aircraft, they expect you to take it, and they tend to start cutting metal, call it 18 months, 15 months ahead of schedule. So, you pretty much lock in most of the year's aircraft sort of if not now, within the next few months but you can do a lot with aircraft beyond that and we've done that in the past when necessary.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, Oscar, you mentioned that you're undertaking a self evaluation of all aspects of the business and there is some headlines, I think Bloomberg that says you guys are reviewing management hubs and operations. So, this is good, and this is, I think, a lot of people have been waiting to see. So, can you give us some color on this? Is this like a full scale what you would refer to sort of like a top to bottom strategic review? And can you give us maybe a sense of how to think about a timeline when you'll have something to say about these things? What is the potential set of outcomes or is this more not like a finite thing that's going to last six months or something, but more of just like an ongoing new approach to how you're thinking about writing the business? So, any color around this would be great. Thanks a lot.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think with regards to duration, I think companies make the mistake of doing these near-term things and then stopping. It's a dynamic world and you have to adjust accordingly but you have to start with a full blown thrust, and it's amazing how quick news travels. I just issued that note this morning to our employees. It is a top to bottom full-scale view on everything that we do. It's something that we have to do and acknowledge and that involves the management structure and who is aligned. I've always said that structure follows strategy and so developing in the near-term what our North Star is, has, I think, been the critical plan.","So we do have a finite time period that we'll work through over the summer. We have a board meeting in September where we'll sort of talk a lot about this, and you'll hear about it in our fourth quarter Investor Day. And then, again, it will change as the dynamics of the competitive marketplace do. But we're excited. It is spanning the globe, if you will, with regards to the conversations we're having. We have more than a few work streams working around every little thing to product offerings, to the broader issues around capacity and network planning. And so, I think it's exciting. So, thank you for asking that.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, great. Thanks.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora on line. Please go ahead.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Oscar, United's operating performance from both in on-time and delay perspective has been steadily improving since last fall, but there has obviously been a lot of industry headwinds that have not allowed your PRASM to really show any benefit from this. I guess, one, what are some of the initiatives you believe have helped you get where you are operationally? And then, second, do you have an estimate of what kind of the PRASM benefit that you have gotten this year from this improved performance?","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I was looking at Greg. I don't know that I have a number specifically for the PRASM impact. But with regards to your question about what's generating this, first and foremost is the incredible passion of the professionals that run our business. They have re-engaged in a way that we haven't seen in a long time. And that's just not me talking; you can ask a lot of folks that are seeing that benefit. They are just working hard and they're engaged and I think that's a big critical factor.","In addition, over time, between project quality, a lot of the process and procedures and investments that we've made in the business, which are substantial, are all assisting those folks, giving them the tools to properly do their job. And the benefits, again, it's a good question that we should come up with a more quantitative answer. It is a significant value. I'd say running better is running cheaper and we are seeing that and we'll get you a better number here in the course of time.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Andrew, if I could add just from a customer perspective on what we're hearing in the marketplace, as Oscar said, the level of operations is really, really strong and the operations team has proven it's sustainable and durable. We're hearing that back from our customers. Our corporate sales force on a routine basis is very excited about, for instance, going in and bringing in the scorecard of our corporate guarantee. And year-to-date, six plus months into it, we're not paying on it, which means we're meeting our commitment on terms of our operations.","So, that \u2013 as Oscar said, it's hard to put a PRASM on it. Those are the things that will lead to PRASM. We're seeing our local share in our hubs rebounding back to levels that we saw before some of our integration issues. And so, we're really, really excited about it.","And lastly, on our call in June, we talked about $300 million of operational efficiency, as well as some of the what I call choice as we get back in terms of being a carrier of choice among our corporate partners. That's a line item in there that does relate to PRASM.","So, as Oscar said, a little bit too early to put a specific number on it but we're getting the right momentum.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we said to the sales force, Jim and I, the notion that we can't sell anymore because we don't a particularly good product, that excuse is no longer on the table.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Yeah.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It fell away. Thank you..","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth on line. Please go ahead.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the update on your thinking on the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more granularity as to which areas or maybe segments, international segments where you're feeling a little bit more concerned about what your thinking is on the kind of the progression here as you head into the end of the year.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Savi, this is Jim. I think as we look out, and as I mentioned, fourth quarter, our expectations, given expectations of demand is measured by GDP declining, we expect obviously that to continue.","The corporate business, although we see the demand flat, the revenue is down on lower yield. We expect that to continue. That's correlated to that expectations of GDP coming down, so that's part of what was driving it. So that's that domestic piece of our ability \u2013 of putting pressure on our ability that I talked about on our April call.","Internationally, we did see weakness in trans-Atlantic PRASM in the second quarter. We're adjusting to that on our slide. We talked about the fourth quarter being down 1% to 2% capacity. So we're reacting to that, Our capacity was up about 2% in the second quarter. We're guiding to 0.6% to 1.6% in the third quarter and we're guiding to down 1% to 2%. So we're addressing some of that demand on the trans-Atlantic side aligning with that capacity with demand.","Latin, we actually \u2013 that's the one where we actually see the quarter-over-quarter improvement on a RASM basis stronger than some of the other entities. And so, we feel good about where the Latin entity is heading as we head into the fourth quarter.","On the Pacific side, it's really from a demand perspective, a lot of the things we talked about in the past with OA capacity. I will say our launches of our new markets are meeting or exceeding our expectations. We are particularly proud that we jumped back in the trans-Atlantic on this, but our San Fran\/Tel Aviv flight is doing exceptionally well and our Asia flights are all meeting and exceeding our expectations. But the demand \u2013 there is still OA capacity demand. We are starting \u2013 we have an opportunity to start San Fran\/Shanghai number two in October. So we're seeing a little bit of capacity from that but we think that over the long run that's the right investment for us to make.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker on line. Please go ahead.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Jim, you've cited that GDP expectations are coming down but GDP is still growing, yet it's revenue that's declining. So, in other words, that long-term relationship between GDP and revenue appears to be decoupling, Ken (28:00).","Now, I understand why this happened when the Internet came along. I understand why it happened briefly during the financial crisis, but I can't point to a secular cause over the last 18 months. So, this leaves us with the obvious conclusion that revenue weakness has to be self-inflicted. Do you share this view or can you identify something secular that's causing this decoupling? Because if you're a rental car agency, and we're talking about Uber, okay, I can kind of figure it out. I can't cite what that secular change might be.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Yeah. Hey, Jamie, I think there is that one correlation with fuel price that has that impact on revenue. We talked about surcharges over time and so forth being down and that correlation in terms of how fuel has affected revenue. So, some of that \u2013 because I do agree in 2015, you're right: industry revenue as a percent of GDP was down and was an inflection point from previous years and I expect that will continue again today.","And so, other than that correlation to fuel, I'll go back to the other thing we've talked about right? We have seen capacity grow faster than demand and that's putting pressure on yields and corporate demand is not growing at the pace. The corp yields, the corporate demand is not growing at that pace of capacity.","We are pretty consistent. I mean, we're back to our initial year guidance on capacity and we're down from that initial year guidance on capacity, and that capacity even where we're guiding today will be less than what expectations of GDP today that we are talking to. So we're managing our plan in this environment and we feel pretty good about it.","The last thing I would say is that on the June call we talked about our slimline and upgauge program. We have some modest growth in the third quarter. That capacity becomes really margin accretive. And so where leisure bookings are strong that's the capacity to absorb that leisure bookings. Lower RASM but at extremely lower cost CASM. So we really feel good about the plan we're rolling out.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jamie, this is Oscar. Jamie?","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Great go ahead, please.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no. You get one question. You got to get back in line but I just (30:40) by the way, it's a very thoughtful question as all of them are but the concept of the self-inflicted portion I think is a very interesting one, and somebody had asked me earlier about the work that we're doing here over the summer. We have to explore that a little bit to make sure that we're not just following historical conventional wisdom all the time because again, as I said, it's a dynamic marketplace and we have to find either the secular impacts or things that we can generate or do better. So, thanks. We'll go to the next call.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for the time. Jim, a question for you. On slide eight, you did a good job of providing just color on PRASM and some of the drivers there. But it seems to only explain about half of the weakness in your unit revenues, right? I mean, just a simple math, you've got 3.5 points out of that 6.5 points. What are some of the other drivers? What are we missing out there?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","I think the other drivers are little bit of \u2013 I just mentioned, capacity is growing faster than demand across the industry and that's putting pressure on yields in an environment where corporate demand is not keeping up with that pace of capacity. And that higher yielding demand that's not there at that greater capacity puts pressure on PRASM.","And the other piece is that modest capacity, in that modest capacity growth we have, if you look at our domestic, we will actually be slightly down in departures in the third quarter to drive that modest capacity growth. That's that margin accretive initiatives that we talked about in June giving a little bit more hold as we roll though the year.","So, that's slimline growth and the upgauge strategy becoming less dependent on the regional and more dependent on to the main line. Again, it offers us ancillary product both first class and Economy Plus. But it does come in at RASM that's lower than the average but an even lower CASM which makes the margin accretive. Those are really the elements that are putting pressure on RASM.","Operator","From Credit Suisse we have Julie Yates on line. Please go ahead.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, another one for you. Just when put out the flat RASM targets in April, what level of sequential improvement were you expecting at the time for the third quarter? I'm just trying to reconcile Q2 coming in at the better end of your range but the outlook for H2 has worsened. So, just trying to calibrate expectations on what the sequential improvement looks like from here?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","If I got the question correct, what we kind of thought third quarter sequential improvement would have been when we made that?","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Correct. Like how much did the outlook for the third quarter deteriorate since the April call?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","It has come down. And so \u2013 and due to that kind of revision down in GDP, the specific number, I don't have that in front of me where we were at from a forecast point of view. But given those GDP revisions, as that related to fourth quarter it's also impacting third quarter. So that weakness is rolling to the third quarter also.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, understood. Is there an updated timeframe in which you are expecting the different entities to get back to flat deposit of RASM?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Again, we're not \u2013 I'm not \u2013 I don't have...","Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer","We're really focused on profitability, as Oscar mentioned in his comment. And so our initiatives out there are focused on doing that. As we lay out that game plan, we're focused on optimizing RASM every day and then put some RASM. And so, as we move through the rest of this quarter into the fourth quarter, we'll be able to get a little more insight and kind of continue to update you guys where we think PRASM is and ultimately where that lands relatively to positive PRASM growth.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Mike Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Jim, I want to go back to \u2013 you talked about further softening of corporate yields. I couldn't tell if that was just a continuation of what we were seeing or is it just noticeable deterioration from where we were a few months back. And the fact that you \u2013 I mean, you mentioned that demand seems to be fine and yet yields are under pressure, how much of that is a function of some of the changes to the fare structures with respect to advanced purchase restrictions maybe going away or Saturday night stays, some of the expenses getting lifted off, sort of lifted away. I mean, maybe that speaks to the point that Jamie brought up about the fact that we're sort of seeing a breakdown here between revenue and GDP. Some of it is related to just the structure out there and maybe the prevalence of a much more liberal fare regime in place. Thoughts on that?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Mike. Thanks for the question. I think pricing actions always affect PRASM, but I think it's more a continuation of what the demand that we're seeing where demand is relatively flat on lower yields.","So, one thing, as you move into a summer peak period and you have that leisure demand strength, it actually, with lack of better words props up your inventory. And so, your lower inventory buckets are not as open as much.","One of the things we're watching as we move past that peak period of summer season is strong leisure demand. And to your point, kind of the corporate demand being relatively flat, that can put relatively more pressure on yields relative to the third quarter where you have peak demand, strong from the June, July, August months.","But to answer your question, we're kind of seeing demand where it was at. I would note that as energy sector continues to be down year-over-year, it's decelerating at a slower rate. So, that's also putting pressure on us on a year-over-year basis as we go forward.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Cowen & Company, we have Helane Becker on line. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys. Thank you for the time. And, Oscar, as we look ahead to your business over the next say two years to five years and during this time period of the revenue improvement that you outlined last month, is there an earnings per share target we should be thinking about that you are thinking about managing to or should we not be looking at it as an EPS target, should we be looking at it as an operating margin target?","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a great question and one that we are in the process of developing with that specific public measure that we're going to be driving to and obviously keeping you updated on. They all have merit. We're going to pursue all of them and certainly, it's more profitable; it's margin improvement; it's closing the margin gap to others or whatever the big drivers are. It's a great question but we will certainly definitely tell you at our fourth quarter Investor Day. It will be the culminating part of our conversation I suspect.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. We'll look forward to it. Thanks.","Operator","From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the time here. Jim, I am wondering where are we at with respect to, I'll call it enhanced revenue management technology getting rolled out. So, the entry-level fares product, I believe United in the past had been targeting the fourth quarter. I am just wondering is that still the case and what does it mean for United exactly here?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Dan. Entry-level fares, yeah we are still targeting second half of this year, a lot of work going on in that area to roll that product out into the marketplace. We're very excited and when you asked what it means for United, it's going to allow us to have a price point that allows us to compete for sure against ultra-low cost carriers and allow us to move some of the dilution that we've placed on ourselves today with our current fare structure. So we're very excited about that. We see that rolling out in the second half of the year.","And so, we look forward to updating you on that. And it will be significant, in our earnings call. We talked about revenue initiatives, of strong customer choice revenue initiatives of $2.5 billion by 2018. That entry-level fare is a piece of that but also pieces of that as we update and become much reliable on the regional carriers and introduce more first class and the Economy Plus will drive other components of ancillary revenue that we have out there today.","And then, finally, on revenue management, as I mentioned on the call in June, we're in the process of moving to a new forecasting model. We call it Gemini. We're in the market. About 2% or 3% of our overall domestic revenue is affected by it and we're getting good results. And so, that is also part of our 2018 initiatives that we talked about that rolling out and we'll update you as we ago but we're still in the very early testing phases of it but getting good results from it.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go, ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey, thanks good morning. So, going back to Mike's question, our checks suggest that you've actually tried to show some leadership with respect to restoring advanced purchase requirements. Would you comment on your experience in this regard and if the more reluctant party was willing to restore these fences as well, what is that worth to United or the industry?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey. This is Jim. Yeah. I'm not going comment on pricing initiatives in the marketplace both ours and other carriers. I'm just not going to comment on that.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. Could I get a second, since I didn't get a byte on that? Jim, do you feel better about year-over-year unit revenue improvement during the peak leisure demand period or during a pure corporate demand period like September?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Well, as I mentioned, it's \u2013 you know, the leisure period drives relatively better unit revenue in the peak summer months relative to other periods of the year. It's a little early for us to get a good handle on corporate demand as we move past the Labor Day weekends; we're very much focused on it. There are things we're lapping across our system that we've talked about in terms of how it affects unit revenue.","On the corporate side, we're seeing flattish demand on lower yields and we're seeing GDP revisions step down and so we're keeping a close eye on that. Again, that's why we've adjusted capacity. Our capacity adjustments that we made to the rest of the year are across the system both international and domestic, and we'll continue to do that as we watch demand going forward.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys.","Operator","From Stephens, we have Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the time. As it relates to the slimline seats, could you give us an update on how much of your domestic network has already been outfitted with these slimline seats and is there a way to sort of summarize the impact that could have in terms of profitability on a seat mile basis?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Slimline, our program is little bit over 50% rolled out right now. In our June call, we talked about it being 50%, so we're beyond that as we're into July now. So it's little bit 50%-plus on the whole network. And so that program is past the halfway point on the slimline side.","In terms of profitability, it comes at a lower RASM but a lower CASM and we haven't put numbers around what that's worth yet. As we walk through the rest of the year, we'll update you folks on our initiatives and we can put some more color on that going forward. We did talk about that program, slimline and upgauge program, driving $800 million of contribution by 2018. So, we'll be able to update you where we are at as we go forward.","Operator","Okay. And from UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. I'm just wondering the cost reduction targets that you guys provided on June 21 and then today's presentation again. Is there a portion of that that's specifically related to achieving a joint collective bargaining agreement with flight attendants?","Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer","No. That's...","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","That's the incremental (44:50)","Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer","It's Gerry. Those cost target is unrelated to the collective bargaining agreements.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","But, I guess, presumably, getting a deal done with the flight attendants would allow you to realize some of the merger synergies that were originally intended. Are you saying that that would be incremental to your $1.3 billion cost reduction target?","Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We look at that separately, that can depend.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Any \u2013 sorry, Oscar.","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Go ahead with your third question.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","I was just going to ask if there was \u2013 if you could provide an updated view on what that -if you could help quantify that synergy from the integration effort and I'll leave it at that? Thanks","Oscar Munoz - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have not done that for a host of different reasons but there are incredible inefficiencies by the way its structured today and we are so anxious to put this behind us for so many different reasons. One of them being the efficiency, mostly the level of service we could provide across our system. So, thank you.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Gerry, just on the CASM outlook for the year. You took 50 bps or 25 bps, I guess, out of the full year capacity guidance. How much pressure did that put on CASM? Is the FX environment helping the CASM outlook now? If you could just help us understand the relationship between kind of capacity reductions and how much pressure that puts on CASM.","Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer","It puts some pressure on CASM. We've dealt with this in the past. Last year, in a situation of declining capacity versus our original guidance, we managed CASM down actually. So, this is all part of the process we have of always looking at opportunities to run the business more efficiently and to drive the cost savings through the various initiatives we have. It's not one thing. It's just all those little things that add up to our ability to manage CASM even in a declining capacity environment.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, again thanks. So, Jim, you said that corporate bookings are about flat with revenues down about 3%. Is it fair to assume that that entire gap is driven by the concept that you've referred to in the past as dilution and is it fair to assume that the main thrust or one of the main thrusts of Gemini is to minimize dilution and in that regard as it relate to the small market that you roll it out, you said you're seeing good results. Is that effectively minimizing dilution or is it good results from other stuff that maybe we're not appreciating that we know about? Thanks.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hi, this is Jim. You're absolutely right. It's minimizing dilution and that's the result that we're seeing. That's what we're targeting and in our test market that's also what we're seeing. So, it's consistent with what our expectations were.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth on line. Please go ahead.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking the extra question. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the \u2013 and what we're seeing on the energy demand in terms of kind of the decline. I just want to make sure I understand. It seems like it's still declining but the comps are getting easier. And then also just from a newer perspective, I don't think we have seen much kind of in the way of volumes in additions of new capacity coming in and then wanted your latest thoughts on what's happening in Newark? Thanks.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Savi, this is Jim. As it relates \u2013 you broke up a little bit on the question \u2013 in terms of Newark and the removal of slots, yeah, I think, we've seen \u2013 we work really, really closely with the FAA, and other carriers. The FAA would say they're oversubscribed in the peak slot period. And on their Level 2, they've worked with the carriers to make sure that we don't deteriorate the operations at Newark. And so we're hopeful and in very close contact with the FAA on that, working with them to do that.","Outside of that, we're not seeing that much in terms of OA growing capacity. And so as it relates to \u2013 that's what we're seeing that's happening in Newark right now.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And just the clarification on the energy decline?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Oh, on the energy, I am sorry. In terms of energy, we're still seeing the decline in energy demand. It is coming at a decelerated pace than what we've seen in the past but it's cumulative so it is impacting our RASM as we move through the rest of the year. The energy sector continues to weaken but at a slower rate.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the follow up. Just on the capacity side internationally, is there anything that you're seeing today that would lead you to believe that industry growth is going to slow materially from that sort of mid-to-high single digit range? I'm just trying to figure out if it's reasonable to assume that international PRASM just remains materially negative as we look into next year.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Yeah. This is Jim. Again, we'll focus on United's capacity. The one piece I'll point out is in Asia and the China capacity. There is limits to capacity growth based on the bilateral that's agreed between China and the U.S. government. And those bilaterals are almost to the point where they've been met. So that will have a natural kind of slowdown in capacity growth from the main U.S. to China. But I wouldn't to comment on other industry capacity around other regions of the world.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","But on that 10 points that you noted capacity growth for the industry in 2Q in Asia, how much of that would actually come down with what you are describing in China?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","We saw capacity growth in China grow over 20% in Q2. And so, obviously, there is run rates that affect as you think about going forward. But pretty much all of it, the \u2013 we're close the route authorities being granted between the two countries work (52:00) out but we did see capacity growing at a little bit over 20% in the second quarter.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank we have Mike Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, thanks for the follow-up question. Hey just \u2013 and this is for Gerry, just with respect to strengthening the balance sheet. When I sort of look at later this year, it looks like there is some additional cash contributions to the pension. When I think about the amount of stock that you want to buy back and your CapEx even after the piece that's been financed, how should we think about your debt levels going forward? Are they going to stay sort of relatively constant or should we anticipate meaningful debt pay down as we sort of move into 2017 and 2018? How should we think about that? Thanks Gerry.","Gerald Laderman - Senior VP-Finance & acting Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So, Mike, the important point is that we need to maintain a healthy balance sheet. We're there, particularly when you talk \u2013 when you add our pension obligation, and when I talk about healthy balance sheet, it's really about managing through a cycle. And we're very comfortable that we would continue to have access to capital through a cycle. We have about $8 billion of unencumbered assets. So I'm comfortable with where our leverage is today, given our business and given what we're trying to do. So, we don't need to significantly reduce leverage at all.","And with the additional CapEx I expect over the next few years, I said when we raised our CapEx guidance back in March with the additional aircrafts our 50 (53:44) seat issue, as well as the early retirement of 747. All of those aircrafts, I would expect to finance and with sort of the range I put out earlier on the call and what I expect to do next year, I think if you run the arithmetic, you would not see a decline in our gross debt number over the next year or two.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. Thanks, Gerry.","Operator","And from Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, thanks for the follow-up here. Jim, another question on the $3.1 billion in initiatives underway, I think a big part of the story is improving efficiency via upgauging. And I think, the domestic upgauging is pretty well understood but if I'm not mistaken, there is also a wide body upgauging that is just beginning, which should aid margins on the international part of the network. And I'm just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit further on that?","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","Hey, Dan, it's Jim. The international upgaugings are really, really small piece, and it's driven mainly by the 767-300 conversions to two class. So that's driving a little bit of that upgauging. It's a really, really small piece of the upgauging that we talked about on our $3.1 billion initiative.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","James E. Compton - Vice Chairman & Chief Revenue Officer","And, in addition, as you think about 2018, when the A-350s come, that fleet will all be part of international upgauging but again in total very small piece.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Jonathan Ireland - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Dan, and thank you to all for joining the call today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Leskinen","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in yesterday\u2019s release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company\u2019s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, investor update and presentation, copies of which are available on our website.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. In addition, we have Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart, and others in the room available to assist with Q&A.","And now I\u2019d like to turn over the call to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected to have our decision on who\u2019s best to fill our CFO seat by \u2013 sometime by today. We found someone obviously who would strike the not only right balance of experience, financial acumen, and leadership and has been part of the team all along, Gerry Laderman, so we\u2019re excited to have him in the seat.","As I think about the quarter, we executed another outstanding quarter, marked by strong financial results and I think lots of momentum. Like I like to say and I said before, it is about proof, not just promise, and we delivered financial results at the high end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance once again in this quarter. Now this is because of the hard work and dedication of our employees, and they continue to find absolutely new ways to meet and exceed the expectations from not only you, our shareholders, but of course, our customers.","A quick recap of the financials. Turning to Slide 4. Yesterday, we reported third quarter adjusted pretax earnings of $1.1 billion with an adjusted pretax margin of 9.7%. Our adjusted earnings per share of $3.06 was 36% higher than last year. We did recapture about 100% of the year-over-year increase in fuel through a balance of revenue and cost control. These results are tremendous and are indicative of the strides we\u2019ve made on our revenue, operational growth initiatives, customer service, all of the initiatives which continue to run ahead of the expectations we\u2019ve established for ourselves.","In fact, Scott will highlight that we\u2019ve realized the strongest PRASM growth in the third quarter in our mid-continent hubs, which also has the highest levels of capacity growth in the quarter, as we laid out to you in January. Looking into the future, we\u2019re sharpening and continuing our focus on our customers. I\u2019d like to give you a few \u2013 maybe four examples here of the actions we took just in this last quarter that I think are beginning to separate us from the competition. They\u2019re only part of what makes us uniquely United.","So first, we know from customer feedback the boarding process has long been an area with room for improvement. After collecting significant feedback from employees and customers around the globe, we rolled out a better boarding process across our system. Better boarding, that\u2019s kind of our brand, means less time waiting in line, and importantly, improved communications with customers and overall a less stressful process for our customers and employees. Innovations like these have an important impact on customer satisfaction.","Secondly, this summer, we announced several new international routes to the most comprehensive route network in the world, including nonstop service from D.C. to Tel Aviv. We\u2019re the only airline in the world to offer nonstop service between these two great capitals. They both have fast-growing tech sectors. Third, this quarter, we greatly expanded our innovative \u2018Every Flight has a Story\u2019 program, which offers real-time and plain English updates to customers when their flights are delayed. Customer feedback on this has made it clear that they greatly value these messages.","And finally, last month, we made a commitment that no other U.S. airline has made to reduce our carbon emissions by 50% by 2050. We celebrated this commitment with the longest trans-Atlantic biofuel flight in history between San Francisco and Zurich. Our long-term investment in biofuels makes this kind of commitment possible. We plan to continue to lead the way when it comes to implementing strategies that are not only good for our business, but also for the future of the planet. But our airline\u2019s most unique asset is our people, and October 1st was a historic day for our airline.","After nearly two years of planning, we completed the full implementation of our flight attendant joint collective bargaining agreement, which required us to merge two extraordinarily complicated systems for scheduling our flight attendants. A change like this isn\u2019t always obvious to our customers, especially when it goes smoothly. But this is an essential component to running an efficient and reliable operation. So I want to congratulate the over 23,000 flight attendants at United who continue to deliver for our customers and are leading us into United\u2019s bright future.","Turning to Slide 5, as we look back over the past nine months since we unveiled our 2018 and 2020 earnings per share targets and the growth plan that will help achieve us those targets, we have much to be proud of. We have largely overcome the significant cost headwinds created by rising fuel prices and still raised our 2018 targeted adjusted EPS multiple times throughout the year. We estimate that we will recapture about 90% of the year-over-year increase in fuel on a full-year basis, and today we are again raising our 2018 adjusted EPS target to $8 to $8.75.","We set absolute adjusted EPS targets for both 2018 and 2020 in January of this year and we\u2019re getting closer to delivering results near the high end of our initial adjusted EPS range in 2018. I also feel encouraged by our fourth quarter outlook and while we won\u2019t provide 2019 adjusted EPS guidance until January, I will say that our preliminary review places us firmly on the path to deliver on our expectations of $11 to $13 of adjusted EPS in 2020.","So with that, here\u2019s Scott.","Scott Kirby","Thank you, Oscar, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. I would like to start by thanking our employees who continue to run one of the best operations in the world. Running a great operation is table stakes for winning customer loyalty, and on top of that, the people of United Airlines are focused on improving customer service and we\u2019re seeing that in our internal customer service metrics.","I know it\u2019s tough to model operational reliability and customer service, and it takes time for those improvements to translate into customer choice and higher revenue, but at United, we're already seeing that show up in our top line. As we've said many times, running a reliable operation and great customer service are fundamental to our success. And without it, our growth strategy simply can't be successful.","As Oscar mentioned, on the 1st of this month, our flight attendant integration took place. We're thrilled to have all of our flight attendants flying on common mettle [ph]. During the week of the integration, our entire leadership team had the privilege of visiting our crew bases around the world to meet with our flight attendants who are the key to our product and customer service. It's energizing to get to talk to hundreds of flight attendants and hear their enthusiasm for the future and their ideas on what more we can do to make the customer experience even better.","Moving on to the revenue environment. With the exception of some countries in Latin America, we continue to see very strong demand across all regions and cabins. Andrew will provide additional details in a moment, but this is one of the best revenue environments we've ever seen. And coupled with the commercial, operational, customer service and growth initiatives we had in place, I've never felt as excited and optimistic about the near term and the long term as I do right now at United. ","While Andrew will talk more about the revenue environment, I can't help but steal a little bit of his thunder to brag on what the team under his leadership, combined with support from the rest of the company, has accomplished with the growth plan. In January, we unveiled our growth strategy, and this summer profitability exceeded even our expectations. We grew our mid-continent hubs nearly 10% in the third quarter with an almost 7% increase in PRASM. At the same time, we continue to grow the balance of the network in line with GDP and delivered a strong 5.6% increase in PRASM in those markets.","Looking ahead, we're obviously encouraged to have been able to raise our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance each quarter as we went through the year in spite of the headwind from higher fuel. While 2018 has started off ahead of our three-year plan, we continue to be focused on delivering or exceeding our target $11 to $13 in adjusted EPS in 2020. The growth plan is the means to the end for delivering on our commitments in 2020 and beyond, and we're pleased to see it working so well so quickly. ","For full-year 2018, we now estimate that we'll be able to pass through about 90% of the run-up from fuel, up from 75% last quarter allowing us to raise our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance for the third time. It was also encouraging to see pretax earnings grow modestly in the third quarter. We're also looking forward to returning to margin growth, however. As we ended the third quarter and entered the fourth quarter, we were cautiously optimistic that the fourth quarter was going to be the quarter we turned the corner and returned to margin expansion. Unfortunately, the recent rapid run-up in fuel now makes that more difficult for the fourth quarter.","As we demonstrated throughout the year, we've done a good job of recovering the increase in fuel prices, but it does come with a lag, which makes it hard to recover large intra-quarter moves in fuel within that quarter. We're looking forward to 2019 when we do expect to not only deliver on adjusted EPS growth, but also return to adjusted pretax margin expansion.","So far, 2018 has been a great year for United. The team continues to execute on the growth plan while running a smooth operation and providing a better experience for our customers. We're still in the early innings on many of our initiatives and are about proving that United is on the right path to be the best airline for customers, employees and investors. We're working every day to be the airline that our customers want to fly. Our success in the third quarter is another step towards realizing United's full potential.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew. ","Andrew Nocella","Thanks, Scott. Taking a look at the revenue environment on Slide 11, we reported a 6.1% increase in system PRASM year-over-year for the third quarter, beating the high end of our 4% to 6% expectations. Congratulations to the entire United team for top-tier PRASM performance in the quarter. I'd also like to specifically recognize the commercial team who had worked collaboratively on hundreds of different commercial initiatives, big and small, to drive this result. All of us on the commercial team, however, would like to give a big thank you to our operations team and frontline employees. Reliability and customer service really matter. Improving our reliability and customer experience drives customers to choose to fly United, and that makes it far easier for our commercial initiatives to succeed.","Domestic PRASM improved 6.7% year-over-year in the first quarter, well ahead of our 1.7% performance in the first half. Domestic capacity increased 7.6%. We saw strength as we move through the quarter, with demand and yields ahead of expectations. Corporate revenues were once again up double digits year-over-year, well outpacing our overall top line growth. Our new revenue management system, Gemini, improved our forecast accuracy, which allowed us to run record load factors for much of the quarter without increasing our involuntary denied boarding rate. In fact, our involuntary denied boarding rates were down 87% versus the third quarter of 2017 and 98% versus 2016. ","Mainline load factors hovered around 90% for the entire month of July and set an internal record for domestic mainline at 91.2%. We also successfully shifted our booking profile and reduced dependence on lower-yielding tickets further out from departure while increasing our share of higher-yielding business tickets generally booked closer in. This traffic mix change was enabled by Gemini's greater forecast accuracy.","The Atlantic region had our strongest year-over-year PRASM of any region in the quarter, increasing 7.1%, including a one point benefit from foreign exchange. We saw revenue strength each month in the quarter, with August PRASM up nearly 10%. This positive year-over-year PRASM momentum was driven by strong load factor performance in both cabins, up almost five points year-over-year. We successfully initiated new service to Porto, Reykjavik and Zurich. For 2019, we've announced new service to Naples, Prague, Tel Aviv and Amsterdam. We continue to expect strong results across the Atlantic for as far as we can see.","While the Atlantic had our strongest PRASM performance, we again made material progress in the Pacific. PRASM was up a solid 5.3% year-over-year, including a one point benefit from foreign exchange. Each month in the quarter saw increasing RASM strength year-over-year.","Yuan has rebounded nicely, and China performance excluding Hong Kong was strong. Unlike the Atlantic, however, Pacific PRASM remains down on a year over two-year basis. This leaves us optimism that we have further to go on improving Pacific PRASM.","We continue to watch demand levels in business class for China flights and have yet to see any reduction in demand for future periods resulting from trade disruptions. Our Latin entity trails the Atlantic and Pacific and was once again the only region with negative year-over-year unit revenue performance in the quarter, being down 3.4% year-over-year. While the region is more challenged than others, flights to Cancun, Brazil and Argentina experienced significant demand weakness. While Q3 Latin performance was once again disappointing, looking forward, we see a mild recovery taking hold in certain parts of the region, specifically Mexico business markets and the Caribbean. We are optimistic about improved RASM results in the fourth quarter in Latin America. Looking ahead, we anticipate fourth quarter PRASM to be up 3% to 5% year-over-year.","Moving on to Slide 12, I\u2019d like to give an update on some of our commercial initiatives. Induction of widebody jets equipped with our all aisle access flatbed Polaris seat continue to be on target. Our Los Angeles Polaris Lounge remains on track to open later this year and the Washington Dulles lounge is expected to open by late 2019. Our Chicago Polaris Lounge was awarded Best Business Class Lounge by the 2018 World Airline Awards from Skytrax. We continue to retrofit one aircraft on average every 10 days with each passing month. As more of our aircraft equipped with the hard products, our fleet transformation is being noticed by our customers.","International premium RASMs grew 3.7x faster than coach in the third quarter, and we can\u2019t wait to see how we\u2019ll perform once Polaris seats are fully rolled out. Our passenger segmentation strategies remain on track as we continue to grow the footprint of Basic Economy. We closely monitor our relative share performance related to Basic Economy sales. We feel it\u2019s important to differentiate the Basic Economy product. We continue to be pleased with the operational benefits of our bag policies.","Another key component to our passenger segmentation strategy is Premium Plus, our new intercontinental premium economy seat. The product is now on a small number of 777 jets and sold in the short term as Economy Plus. We continue to expect to reach a critical mass of equipped aircraft early next year for an official product launch. Premium Plus is scheduled to be rolled out by late 2020 across most of the widebody fleet on a similar schedule to Polaris. More details on Premium Plus will be released later this week as we prepare for our first sales next year.","Earlier this week, we announced the second phase of optimizing our Newark and Dulles schedules for local and connecting passengers. This change allows us to focus Newark capacity on local passengers and connecting passengers to and from our intercontinental departures while adding scope to Dulles for domestic connecting passengers. The first phase to changes is now flying, and we\u2019re really pleased with the early results. Our rebanking efforts in Chicago and Houston have performed well. In the third quarter, both hubs\u2019 RASM in catchment markets, something we focused on, grew over 2x the remainder of the hub. We recently loaded for sale our rebanked Denver hub for February 2019.","Our ancillary revenue per passenger is up 10% this quarter, led by increased demand for Economy Plus. We recently implemented new functionality that allows customers to upgrade their flight outside of the booking window and check-in window, which provides many more opportunities for customers to buy into the premium cabin. In summary, we feel the revenue environment is robust and that we\u2019re set up really well for a strong fourth quarter.","And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Gerry to review our financial results.","Gerry Laderman","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, we released our third quarter 2018 earnings and our fourth quarter investor update. You can refer to those documents for additional detail. For the highlights, Slide 15 is a summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 15 shows our adjusted results. For the third quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.06 that\u2019s 36% higher than the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted pretax income was $1.1 billion and adjusted pretax margin was 9.7%. Slide 16 shows our total unit cost for the third quarter of 2018 and our estimates for the fourth quarter and full year.","Turning to Slide 17. Nonfuel unit cost for the third quarter decreased 0.4% on a year-over-year basis, near the midpoint of our expectations going into the quarter. As we better utilize our assets in the quarter, especially in the shorter month of September, our unit cost performance benefited greatly. We expect fourth quarter nonfuel unit cost to be flat to down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This guidance implies that our 2018 nonfuel unit costs are expected to be down between 0.1% and 0.3%. The implied midpoint is higher than our previous guidance and is driven by two primary cost drivers, both of which I would define as good costs.","First, our stronger passenger revenue performance in the third quarter, even higher than our own optimistic expectation, got higher distribution expense than we estimated at the time we issued our guidance. This higher distribution expense drove approximately $30 million of incremental cost, mostly in credit card fees and GDS expense. In addition, the great work done by our cargo team throughout the year has led to approximately $125 million in incremental cargo revenue compared to our original expectations for the year. While this has been a great tailwind to our earnings, it does come with approximately $20 million of incremental costs tied to additional handling and trucking needed to carry the additional freight.","The combination of these two good costs led to approximately $50 million in unanticipated headwinds, translating into 20 basis points of additional CASM for the year. But to be very clear, this does not alter our view going forward. And as we move into the second year of our growth strategy, we are still targeting flat or better nonfuel unit cost for 2019. As we speak, we are in the midst of our 2019 budgeting process, and we will have more to share with you on our earnings call in January. However, based upon all the work done to date, I am confident we will deliver on our CASM-ex target in 2019.","As you see on Slide 18, we purchased $34 million in shares of our common stock in the quarter and have purchased just over $1 billion of our shares through the first three quarters of the year at an average price of $68.16. Our repurchase strategy over the last few quarters has been to use a grid-based 10b5-1 trading program. Our trading grid for the quarter was established before our second quarter earnings call back in July.","The grid allows us to be opportunistic, which generally means buying more if the stock declined, but buying less if the stock increased. Given the outperformance of the stock since the call at one point up about 26%, the maximum repurchase price in the grid was exceeded. But as a long-term opportunistic purchaser, we\u2019re also going to be patient. Fluctuations in the stock market over the last several weeks demonstrate that the market will give us future chances to deploy our free cash flow on share repurchases at points in time where the stock decline significantly even though nothing may have changed about our outlook and long-term view of our earnings power. Our approach will result in quarterly variations in our program. But we absolutely believe we will be able to grow EPS and remain confident that our stock represents a compelling long-term investment.","Turning to our fleet. We took delivery of one Boeing 737 MAX 9 and two used Boeing 767-300ER aircraft in the quarter. We also took delivery of a third used Boeing 767-300ER aircraft just last week. For the remainder of 2018, we expect to take delivery of three Boeing 787-10 aircraft, three Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft and our last Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft.","We announced earlier this month that we ordered nine additional Boeing 787-9 aircraft with deliveries of those aircraft starting in 2020. These aircraft are expected to replace international widebody aircraft flying in our fleet today. We are also actively looking for additional used aircraft to ensure that as we grow, we do so in a capital efficient and flexible way. At the moment, we are focusing on a number of potentially attractive used aircraft opportunities to supplement our new aircraft order book.","Slide 19 includes a summary of our current guidance, including fourth quarter\u2019s projected fuel price range using the October 12 fuel curve. The ranges provided for capacity, revenue and cost implies a fourth quarter adjusted pretax margin between 5% and 7%.","Finally, Slide 20 presents a summary of our full year 2018 guidance when rolling our fourth quarter expectations into three quarters of actual results. As Oscar and Scott both mentioned, for the third time this year, we\u2019ve raised the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance. This is why I am thrilled to be in the CFO seat. We are delivering on our promises, and I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on the executive team to fully implement our strategy and unlock United\u2019s full potential.","With that, I will now turn it back to Mike to begin the Q&A.","Michael Leskinen","Thanks, Gerry. First, we\u2019ll take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] And from JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning everybody. First question for Scott. What would it take to move to a profit pooling structure with your immunized JV partners? Just curious if you\u2019re leaving some margin on the table by not having a structure more like, say, what Delta has with Air France-KLM?","Scott Kirby","So we\u2019ve made incredible progress over the last couple of years with our JVs, particularly the Atlantic JV with Air Canada and Lufthansa. We work much more closely together. We\u2019ve done a good job of getting our interests aligned, and you could see that in our results. Some of our improvement across Atlantic is because of the better cooperation and partnership with those two airlines. Ours is a revenue based sharing instead of profit sharing. And mathematically, those come to essentially exactly the same answer, so it\u2019s a lot more complicated to do profit sharing instead of revenue sharing, and I think the answer at the end of the day is essentially exactly the same. And so, we\u2019re not philosophically opposed to it, but really don\u2019t see much upside and given all the brand damage it would take, more unlikely we\u2019d go to that.","Jamie Baker","Got it. Understood. And also Scott, and maybe for Greg, with operational metrics having improved, I would think that the value proposition that United can offer when negotiating or renegotiating corporate contracts is higher than what it used to be. What\u2019s the cadence of corporate contract expirations look like over the next two to three years? Is it fairly consistent? Is it front-or back-end loaded? I\u2019m just thinking about how long it might take for you to start generating more of the domestic yield premium to the industry the way that Delta does, and obviously, winning that corporate share would be a catalyst there. Any thoughts?","Andrew Nocella","Jamie, it\u2019s Andrew. That\u2019s an interesting question. The contracts are always coming up, and we have a bunch of big ones that we\u2019re working on actually right now. So we think there\u2019s plenty of opportunity in the short and medium term to make sure that customers and our corporate clients see the great operation that the whole United team, led by Greg, is running. Maybe I\u2019ll let Greg kind of add on to that.","Greg Hart","Sure. Thanks, Andrew. As we\u2019ve improved our operational performance in the reliability and our customer service, we\u2019ve seen some customers return to United that left us when we were not running the greatest of operations several years ago. And that \u2013 the return of those customers have nothing to do with capacity, but more focused on our operational reliability. Our team is running what we think is one of the best airlines in the world. We\u2019ve led the industry in D0 performance since 2017, and our 90,000 employees have done this while we operate in we\u2019re operating one of the most difficult environments with one of the most, I think, the most difficult hub structures of anyone.","And in Chicago, where we\u2019ve got a direct competitor, we\u2019ve had better D0 performance or better completion performance for 20 months in a row. I really credit to the team out there working hard every day to make sure our customers get to where they need to be on time, day in \u2013 flight in, flight out. And obviously, it didn\u2019t happen overnight. We\u2019ve got \u2013 as a result of the recovery of the operation, we\u2019ve seen market share come back that we previously lost. And we\u2019ve also seen our improving customer service beginning to pay dividends, and we see at our internal customer metrics, and that translates into customers choosing to fly United when they have a choice more often than not. And everything we\u2019re doing here at United ties together from the world-class reliability to improving the product and customer service to the growth that drives customers to proactively choose United when given a choice.","Jamie Baker","Got it. It\u2019s very helpful. Definitely appreciate it. Thank you everybody.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Yes. Not to take anything away from that previous exchange you had with Jamie, but part of the reason why you\u2019re getting corporate travel is because you\u2019re spending so much on travel agency commissions. You\u2019re up 30% year-on-year. It\u2019s tracking to like a $350 million expense for United, these travel agency commissions. So I\u2019m kind of curious to know how much corporate share are you buying with these incentive fees. And bigger picture, if you want to talk about it \u2013 because you\u2019re not the only one doing it, by the way. Everybody is ramping up these agency fees to hundreds of millions of dollars. So how do we make sure these things don\u2019t sort of spiral out of control and we have some sort of cost arms race like we had in the 90s on this?","Scott Kirby","So, we have increased our travel agency payments and corporate payments. I think if you went back and looked at the history, you\u2019d see that, that was a responsive measure as opposed to a leading measure, and really basically, our philosophy, we\u2019re not going to lose share over something like that. Our goal is also not to win share through that, but to win share through being the airline that customers choose to fly, but we can\u2019t allow ourselves to lose share when our competitors are out trying to buy it.","Hunter Keay","Right. Okay, that\u2019s probably all you want to talk about there. I get it. Thanks for that, Scott. And then a couple of questions on cash usages in 2019. Can you help me think about pension contributions next year? And is $5 billion in CapEx \u2013 growth CapEx, a good starting point to think about that for 2019 given also the moving parts on the fleet front? Thanks a lot.","Gerry Laderman","Hey. On pension, a little too early to tell. We\u2019ve been contributing about $400 million a year to our pension and we are moving well into the direction of having a well-funded plan. So, a little bit too early to tell. We will know in January what our expected contributions for the year is, but it certainly won\u2019t be more than what we\u2019ve been doing historically. With respect to CapEx generally, this year was a down year versus last year. Last year, we had about $4.7 billion of CapEx. This year, down, we\u2019re in that $3.6 billion, $3.8 billion range. All I can say about next year, which is a year of more aircraft deliveries than this year, I don\u2019t expect it to exceed what we did last year. So, I think it would be well below the number you threw out there.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thanks, Gerry. Appreciate it.","Operator","From Citigroup, we have Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey","All right. Thanks for the time. Can you talk about the growth in your mid-continent hubs and particularly, like what aspects are creating the RASM outperformance? I assume because you highlighted those hubs as opportunities, they must have probably been underperforming in the prior year. So maybe, you could talk about it in terms of why you\u2019re getting such good RASM, how much of it is comp, how much of it is restructuring the hub, how much of it\u2019s you just needed the overall volume of the growth? Any which way you could put that in context will be great. Thank you.","Andrew Nocella","Kevin, it\u2019s Andrew. Really pleased by what we\u2019ve accomplished so far in Houston and Chicago. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy comps. But I will say having looked at the performance of all the hubs, I think those three hubs in particular, including Denver, can produce higher margins for the company. And we went through the details of every nuts and bolts of how we put together our schedule. I think we quickly came to the conclusion that the schedules we previously offered did not provide the right patterns to our customers, the right frequency levels and the right level of connectivity. And those patterns, in fact, created more low-yield connectivity than high-yield connectivity. And so we went through a process this year or late last year, changing Houston and then Chicago early this year, where we reconnected every dot in a way that favored better yields and traffic onboard these aircraft, more connectivity, and it worked incredibly well.","In fact, it\u2019s exceeded our expectations. They were the fastest-growing part of the airline and RASM, in fact, grew faster there than the other slower parts of the airline. So we think that is a sign that this philosophy is working. We were now ready to embark on this same journey in Denver. In fact, the new schedule in Denver is loaded for sale. That new schedule includes one less bank of departures, which allow all the remaining banks to be bigger and have a different level of connectivity, which we again, expect to drive really good improved results in Denver year-over-year starting in late February. So really pleased by the performance, how we build these schedules matter. It is a gigantic jigsaw puzzle and we just were able to put that puzzle together in a much better way for our customers, and that is generating more revenue for the company.","Kevin Crissey","Thank you. And maybe, if I could follow up. Some of what you talk about sounds like it has elements of procyclicality, meaning more connections going for higher-yielding connectivity, maybe some investments in the lounges, et cetera. So there\u2019s certainly some concerns in the market about where we are in the cycle. Can you talk generally about where United is and how you\u2019re positioned? Should we be later in the cycle than maybe current demand suggests?","Andrew Nocella","Well, I think we\u2019re nimble and we\u2019re well on our way towards our EPS targets, and we\u2019re going to be making sure we\u2019re in that direction. But Gerry, do you want to add to that?","Gerry Laderman","Yes. I think one of the important things to remember is the flexibility we\u2019ve maintained in our fleet. We\u2019re always looking forward to see what can we do if we need to reduce aircraft from the flying schedule, and we have plenty of leased aircraft that we can return instead of buying off-lease, which is what we\u2019ve been doing recently. And we have our older aircraft, which we can manage those retirements both to reflect what we need for capacity and also to manage costs and avoid maintenance expense as well. So, I think the fleet flexibility is critical to being able to adjust for whatever the cycle brings.","Kevin Crissey","Thank you so much for your time.","Operator","From Cowen, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks, operator. Hi everybody. Thank you so much for the time. And so just this question here, you said during the quarter, you were saying improved premium, I guess, premium numbers, yields and so on. How \u2013 can you say how much of that is because you had easy comps with storms last year? And how much of it is true revenue performance that will continue through the fourth quarter and beyond?","Andrew Nocella","It\u2019s Andrew. I think our guidance for the fourth quarter would tell you that it\u2019s not just easy comps. I think we are putting together a schedule of products and services and delivering it incredibly reliably that it\u2019s having a few more customers choose United, as Greg just laid out a few minutes ago. So we\u2019re really pleased. And when we look at where we\u2019re going in the fourth quarter, what the premium cabins look like so far in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re excited about what the future holds.","Helane Becker","Okay. So, maybe, I can ask it differently, can you say how much premium products outperformed the economy products?","Andrew Nocella","I think I did in my script. It was 3.7 points better. I mean the premium cabins did really well across the board and the premium cabins even did fairly well to Latin America given the overall environment.","Helane Becker","Okay. And are you finding that you don\u2019t have enough opportunity to sell those products and that you\u2019re turning people away from that, or are you able to accommodate everybody who wants to be in that cabin?","Andrew Nocella","That\u2019s a good question. And we spent a lot of time trying to figure out how many seats should be on our aircraft and how many seats should be in each and every cabin. United\u2019s hubs are located in the best premium markets on the globe. They represent the majority of business traffic to and from the United States. It is something, I think, very unique to us. And so we think we have appropriately sized our cabins to accommodate the business class needs or the premium needs across the globe. ","So I think we're pretty pleased with that, and we offer, I think, pretty large-sized cabins to make sure whether you're going to China or London Heathrow, we can do that. We continue to look at the number of premium class seats we have onboard on all our aircraft given where our hubs are located. And I think, actually, we'll have more to say on this in the future as we make sure that we have the right number onboard every single aircraft we have.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much. I appreciate it. And Oscar that was a nice job on CNBC this morning.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Helane.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Two here. Andrew, the industry, obviously, it's becoming very much of a real estate game. And when I look at your position in Newark, there is a new terminal going up. And I'm just curious, your footprint at that new terminal relative to what you have today, is it of similar size? Or do you have room to build out further? And I'm just asking this because as you go through these phases, where you pull markets out of Newark and put them into Dulles, there's probably some loss there, maybe it's connections, maybe these routes are loss leading and it makes the most sense. But I'm just curious on space opportunities that you have with the new airport and maybe the P&L impact of these changes as you move airplanes from one \u2013 air flights from one airport to another.","Andrew Nocella","All right. Mike, to be really clear, while we are moving certain markets out of Newark into Dulles, those are markets that tend to have no material local traffic to and from Newark. We are not reducing our footprint at the airport. So we have replaced the flights that we've removed with new incremental frequencies to the bigger destinations that have a much more larger population base to fly to and from New York, whether it be Nashville, Tennessee or Memphis or you name it. So our footprint's not declining at the airport at all. And in fact, by moving these flights around, we're offering better intercontinental connectivity for our global flights, and we're offering more local customers better choices for flights.","So that is what we're doing in New York and that is better suited for Newark, and Dulles is better suited for these connecting traffic flows. So there is absolutely no reduction in Newark. And in fact, the number of seats we're offering on a Newark is growing as we use larger aircraft to these larger destinations. So we're really pleased by that. In terms of the new terminal in Newark, we're really excited by all the developments the Port is doing in Newark in terms of redeveloping the facilities, and we continue to work with them. I don't think we have anything to say today about United's exact footprint in that facility. But hopefully, we will in the future. And again, we're really excited about what we're doing in New York and Newark, in particular.","And as I said in my script, the success of the changes we've already implemented, which happened earlier this month, is really beyond our expectations already. And we just announced Phase 2 of that given how well it's going.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. Just a quick one for Gerry. Gerry, would you know just roughly your split between fixed and floating rate debt on balance sheet?","Gerry Laderman","Roughly speaking, let's call it about 18-20.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. 18, fixed.","Gerry Laderman","Fixed, yes. Obviously, the bulk of the aircraft financing is all fixed. We have a little bit of aircraft financing floating. And then our term loan is the other big piece, but the vast majority is fixed.","Michael Linenberg","Thanks, Gerry. Thanks, thanks Andrew.","Operator","From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. So Oscar or Gerry, you commented in your prepared remarks that you're well on track to hit your 2020 EPS targets. And I know you don't want to talk about 2019 right now. But can you give us two points here? What fuel are you assuming in that EPS range looking forward? And then secondly, should we be thinking this is a linear progression? Or are there upfront development costs in either revenue or the cost side that would make this more back-end loaded or front-end loaded?","Gerry Laderman","So on fuel, it's pretty simple. We always assume our forecast to forward curve and use that for our modeling purposes.","Scott Kirby","In terms of hitting our earnings target, however, we believe as has been demonstrated this year that there is a link between fuel prices and revenue. It does come with a short lag. But much like this year, if we just started the year and just look at the forward fuel curve, it went up pretty significantly. And our revenues and other initiatives kicked in to recover that increase in fuel price. And as we look at 2019 and at 2020, it really is not predicated on a price of fuel. It is predicated on the relationship between revenue and fuel price, and that's what gave us confidence earlier this year to put out a 2020 target. It's what gives us confidence today to say that we can have margin expansion next year and gives us confidence that we can hit the 2020 target of $11 to $13 because regardless of what fuel does, we believe we'll be able to recover those increases or those changes with the short lag.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. I appreciate that. And then on the CapEx question earlier, Gerry, should we be thinking that 9% to 10% of revenue is the right place to be looking forward? Or is that more in the expansionary phase here in United and it should taper off as we look out in the future?","Gerry Laderman","It depends. The visibility we have for 2019 is pretty solid. 2020 and beyond is too early to tell. Let me give you a couple of data points, though. So in a world where, let's say, we \u2013 and this was in the past where we weren't growing, just kind of maintenance CapEx for us would run roughly $3 billion to $3.5 billion. That's a combination of nonaircraft CapEx, which runs probably $1.5 billion a year, plus or minus a little bit. We can only adjust that just depending on circumstances.","But then when you have an aircraft fleet of our size and you're just dealing with the natural replacement cycle, assuming 25-year, 30-year life on aircraft, that's what get you to kind of the $3 billion to $3.5 billion sort of what I would describe as maintenance CapEx. That's one of the reasons why as we grow, and obviously some of that growth will require additional aircraft, we want to mix the new aircraft with used aircraft to really manage our CapEx going forward.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","And from Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning and thanks for your time. Scott, Andrew, a question for you on the 4Q PRASM guide. Can you maybe just break out how much of that 4% or so is attributable with the Gemini, the reversal of Basic Economy and the approach there and so on? And then also, just any initial thoughts on 2019 capacity?","Scott Kirby","Looking backwards, in fact, going all the way back to January or February last year when we were in New York, I think we said Gemini was worth roughly 0.7. We've analyzed how we think Gemini is doing, and we do think it's in that range, if not a little bit above that range. So we're pretty pleased by that, and we are continuing to make more improvements to the system. In fact, we made a number of significant tweaks this summer.","So as those fully ramp up into the system, we think it has some upside going into 2019. We're not breaking out all the other initiatives. As I said when I started the call, we literally have hundreds of different things we're working on. Some of them are really big like Gemini, our redevelopment, our lounge network for Polaris or putting Premium Plus on aircraft, and some of them are really small that would never get anybody's attention.","But we're all working together as one team and making sure we have a strong pipeline of items that can continue to drive incremental RASM as we go forward \u2013 or incremental margin, more to the point. And so we're really pleased by that. It requires a constant set of innovations and changes and building that pipeline to make sure that we can continue to do that as far as the eye can see. And I feel really comfortable that the whole commercial group is on target to continue to deliver that, and we're really pleased with the results so far.","Rajeev Lalwani","And 2019 capacity?","Scott Kirby","So we'll give formal 2019 capacity in January. We're in the process of building the budget. And the team is doing the bottoms-up build, which is how we build our capacity plan, not top-down. All of that is driven by the North star meeting or exceeding our 2020 earnings target of $11 to $13 per share. And we're not dogmatic about capacity. But to the extent it is the best way to achieve that, then we're going to be focused on achieving our commitment for the $11 to $13 per share in earnings.","And as you look at what has happened in 2019, clearly, the growth plan has been successful so far. Our CASM is better than it otherwise would have been, our RASM is better than it otherwise would have been, our earnings, our margins better than they otherwise would have been.","And so at least as we sit here today, it certainly feels like the growth plan is working well, and so it would be hard to abandon the growth plan and change our capacity plans as long as it's continuing to work well. But we'll give formal guidance in January.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. If I could just sneak one quick one in for Gerry. Gerry, is there anything included in the $11 to $13 number for buybacks?","Gerry Laderman","No, just very little.","Operator","Thank you. From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning everyone. Scott or maybe Andrew, kind of domestic pricing is really just finding its footing right now. But how do you think about the elasticity of demand and at what level of fares or fare growth would you be maybe become a little bit more concerned about volumes?","Scott Kirby","So demand has been inelastic. Almost any way you look at it, I think the price elasticity of demand for leisure travelers is about minus 0.7; and for business demand, it's about minus 0.3. Another way of thinking about this fares in real terms are down about 50% in the last 30 years. It's been great for consumers. It's been great for people being out and getting to travel. It's been good for the overall economy, but we have a very long way to go before we would get to a point where I think we need to worry about price elasticity impacting demand.","Andrew Didora","Interesting, thank you. And then maybe going back towards the focus in the mid-continent hubs. Can you maybe give us a bit of a status update on where the buildup has gone relative to plan? What inning are you in, in terms of the buildup there? And once you get past the rebanking in Denver, kind of what is left there in mid-continent? And I guess, I asked because the network focus of late, at least from some of the releases we've seen, seems to be centered a lot more around your East Coast hubs right now. Thanks.","Andrew Nocella","Yes. I would say, we're still early in this particular game related to the hub restructures. Sometimes, you put these together and their required tweaks based on what you learn. Right now, I would just say, we're well ahead of where we thought we'd be in Houston and Chicago, and their performance, I think, shows it. And Denver's coming online. So I think there's more to come. We're going to learn a lot about Denver over the next six months in what we've got right and what potentially we'll tweak. We haven't made any significant changes to Houston or Chicago yet because they are performing really well, so that may be the end game at least for now. But what I will say about schedule just in general is it really is a jigsaw puzzle that we've put together time after time as we create the schedule, and the group just loves to do that.","And so the answer does change based on all the factors that go into it, whether it be the macro economy and what competition is doing. And we're going to be nimble, and we'll continue to adjust. But we think we're still relatively early in the game. Denver is about to come upon us in a few months, and we're excited about what we've seen so far. And we will likely make more tweaks to make it even better going forward.","Andrew Didora","Understood. Thank you everyone.","Operator","From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead","Dan McKenzie","Hey, good morning thanks guys. With respect to the commentary about margin expansion in 2019, that's just not a part of the investor conversations that I'm having. I'm just wondering if you can just help us understand or pinpoint with more specificity where that confidence is coming from. Is it macro driven? Is it the commercial initiatives that are ahead of schedule? And for example, if you were looking for $600 million in net revenue improvement from the network initiatives, is it because you're getting the $600 million today already? I'm just wondering if you could just help us pinpoint where that confidence is coming from on the revenue side.","Scott Kirby","Well, on a high level, it's everything. It's cost discipline. It's running a good operation. It's great customer service. It is all the commercial initiatives that you talked about. So it's not one single element. And look, we've got 100% recovery of earnings in the third quarter, not the margin expansion. But if we have had this call three weeks ago, we would have expected that we had a good shot at margin expansion in the fourth quarter.","Now fuel ran a couple hundred million dollars increase or so for the fourth quarter in the last couple of weeks. And as we said, that's hard to recover in the short term. But we're almost there right now. And we think all of those initiatives we're going to \u2013 Gerry said in his prepared remarks, we're confident that we're going to have CASM flat or better next year. So we have that going for us. We are confident that the customer service and operational performance will continue to be leading \u2013 world leading. And the commercial initiatives just continue to hit on almost all cylinders. And so you put all that together, we really feel like we're on track next year to not just grow earnings and EPS, but also to expand margins because we're on the trajectory to do it right now.","Dan McKenzie","Perfect. thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] And from Wall Street Journal, we have Alison Sider. Please go ahead.","Alison Sider","Hi, thank you so much. You talked a lot about the strength in premium. I was wondering if you could if you could tell us anything about whether fares for premium products are rising faster than for economy in the main cabin.","Andrew Nocella","This is Andrew. In looking back over the last few months, we did more premium cabin growth and load factors than we did in yield or otherwise fares. So I would say, our premium fares were up, but they were \u2013 the change in our PRASM on the business class cabins, particularly across the Atlantic, had more to do with higher paid load factors, which we're really pleased to see. So going forward, I think I see a little bit more yield strength than load factor. I think we're going to have both that I now see yield kicking in more going forward as we head into the fourth quarter for the premium business.","Alison Sider","Thanks. And if I could just ask one more. You mentioned sort of demand for Economy Plus driving ancillary revenue. I was wondering if you could tell us a little more about what \u2013 at what rate people are kind of buying up to Economy Plus and also whether that includes plans that you all discussed to sort of charge extra for the preferred seats that are still within economy but may be closer to the front.","Andrew Nocella","That does \u2013 I think we haven't officially launched that yet. We've talked about it, the latter, in terms of preferred seats. Economy Plus has just been a great hit. We have a large Economy Plus cabin onboard our aircraft, and we are working every day on more and more ways to make people realize that we have that particular product available, which provides a little bit more legroom and the seat closer to the front of the airplane.","And I think really the secret recipe here is making it available and making it seen by more passengers and more distribution outlets year-over-year. And so our digital team is working hard at that, and that is I think driving the result that we talk about on the call. So we will continue to make sure we make that product available, as widely dispersed as possible. And I think that alone will drive the growth. And we do have more paid load factor room in that section of the aircraft, so we're excited to see what we can deliver on that line item in 2019.","Alison Sider","Thanks.","Operator","And from Bloomberg News, we have Justin Bachman. Please go ahead.","Justin Bachman","Yes hi guys thanks for the time. I wanted to ask a little bit about what's driving the business traffic and what's driving yields there in terms of whether it's greater volumes from your corporate contracts or if it's close-in bookings. Or what are you seeing and some other color on what's behind the business traveler?","Andrew Nocella","It may differ a little bit by region. But overall, globally, it's strong. It's not even \u2013 it's even, I think, decent in Latin America, quite honestly. It's coming across the board, though. Our sales force has been out there pounding the tree, as we've talked about on the past calls, and doing a great job. But more importantly, we're running a great operation, and that is helping people choose United in greater ways than they've ever done before. And we're rolling out what is a fantastic business class product that we talk about as Polaris. We have one aircraft entering the fleet every 10 days with Polaris seats, and those seats are just really best-in-class.","And I think we have a lot of runway to go. I can't wait until we have Polaris business class seats on every single one of our widebody jets. It can't come soon enough.","Justin Bachman","Great, thank you.","Operator","From USA Today, we have Dawn Gilbertson. Please go ahead.","Dawn Gilbertson","Hi good morning Andrew, this question is \u2013 and you may have answered it in a roundabout way in your opening comments. But on Basic Economy, do you guys have any plans to change your carry-on bag restriction like American did in September; and if not, why not?","Andrew Nocella","Hi, Dawn. how are you?","Dawn Gilbertson","Good.","Andrew Nocella","It has been a year from yet. On Basic, we are happy with where we're at. The way we designed Basic was carefully constructed to be, I think, a win for allowing us to segment our products, to allow us to compete effectively against the ultralow-cost competitors and allow our operation to deliver better results for everybody in terms of on-time departures. And it's working as designed, and so we're full speed ahead with where we're at.","Dawn Gilbertson","So no plan to change that policy on the carry-on bag?","Andrew Nocella","There are no plans to change any policies.","Operator","And from CNBC, we have Leslie Josephs. Please go ahead.","Leslie Josephs","Hi good morning. I saw there was a lot of growth in regional. Could you update me on where you guys are with possible scope release with your negotiations with pilots? And also just a question for Oscar. Do you want to stay on past 2020? You have a 5-year agreement, right? It is a turnaround.","Scott Kirby","So I'll start with scope. I'll give it in a second forward to Oscar. First, we are in negotiations with our pilots. Those are progressing, and there's cordial tone at the table, cooperative tone. We disagree on some things but are working together to understand each side's perspective. With regard to scope, I and all of us at United fully understand the history that our pilots have had and where they have seen their jobs outsourced to regionals, certainly, their perspective, and their perspective I would agree with.","And because of that, they are sensitive on scope. But the world is different today. We are growing United mainline, and it's working well, and we intend to continue that. And that's what matters to our pilots. And if we can find a way \u2013 we will find a way where we can use regionals to have competitive scope. We need to have competitive scope with American and Delta. The competitive scope that helps fuel the growth for mainline, that's going to be a win-win for everyone. And I am confident that we will ultimately get to a place that is good for our pilots, that they think it's good for them and that is good for the company as well.","Operator","Thank you.

And thank you, all, for joining us on our Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.","Today, we reported pretax earnings of $1.1 billion, the highest quarterly profit in United's history. We earned $2.75 per diluted share, nearly double our earnings per share in the third quarter last year. We had good revenue and cost performance in the quarter. Our revenue results demonstrate the progress we're making in our revenue management, network and express operation, while our solid cost performance largely reflects the early results of Project Quality, designed to deliver $2 billion of annual cost savings by 2017.","During the quarter, we also returned $220 million in cash to our shareholders under our $1 billion share buyback program.","I want to thank our employees for their hard work during the summer and for their skills in responding to the multi-week outage of the Aurora en route FAA facility, which significantly affected our operations. They did a great job responding and handling the effects on our customers, and I'm proud of them.","So far this year, we've made a number of improvements to our operations, and we'll continue to focus on our reliability and product. Our goal is to deliver flyer-friendly service, a competitive product and competitive margins. We're continuing to take steps to improve the customer experience for our passengers, including installing in-flight satellite-based WiFi and streaming video on our mainline fleet as well as adding WiFi and streaming video on our 2-cabin regional fleet. As of today, we have WiFi in more than half of our mainline aircraft, nearly 200 of which are equipped with streaming video. By the end of the year, 2\/3 of the mainline fleet will have WiFi and we will have begun installation on our 2-cabin regional fleet.","Our progress this quarter shows that our plan is working. We're excited about the opportunities ahead, and this management team is committed to executing in each area of the business to realize this company's potential. We will continue to make progress against our plan and will take all appropriate actions to generate the level of earnings we and our shareholders expect.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, Greg and John.","James E. Compton","Thanks, Jeff.","First, I'd also like to recognize our employees for running an ever-improving airline this quarter. I appreciate our employees' commitment to providing great service to our customers. I'd also like to thank our customers for choosing United. We are making strides each day to improve your flying experience, and we appreciate your business.","In the third quarter, United's consolidated PRASM grew 3.9%, on capacity growth of 0.5% year-over-year. The improvements we've made to our Pacific network continued to pay off. Our new routes to Chengdu and Taipei have both performed better than expectations. We also continue to see strong results from transforming our Narita flying and regauging our Australia routes. Additionally, high demand for our China service during this -- during the peak summer travel season helped offset pressure from the continued industry capacity growth.","Our trans-Atlantic flying was also able to absorb the additional competitive capacity and performed better than expected in the third quarter, largely driven by strong premium cabin bookings, particularly in London. Although the trans-Atlantic entity has experienced several recent pressures, including Middle East unrests; the Ukrainian conflict; and more recently, concern about Ebola, we have not seen any meaningful impact on bookings to date. In the Latin America markets, particularly deep South America, we exceeded our expectations, recovering more quickly from the World Cup slowdown than we initially anticipated.","In the third quarter, revenue from our total corporate portfolio, including our rapidly growing PerksPlus product, grew approximately 5%. Ancillary revenue continued to grow in the third quarter, increasing approximately 11% per passenger and keeping us on track to achieve $3 billion in ancillary revenue in 2014.","During the quarter, Economy Plus revenue increased by double digits due to enhanced pricing optimization and a lower refund rate. We decreased the refund rate by implementing an improved solution for reseating customers during aircraft swaps. Additionally, we recently began to sell Economy Plus through the Amadeus and Sabre distribution systems, allowing our travel management partners and travel agencies to seamlessly book extra-legroom seats for our customers, further driving additional Economy Plus sales. We are pleased with the progress we're making on improving our revenue thus far, and we still have many more opportunities to optimize the value of our network.","On the last earnings call, I introduced our three-pronged approach to growing passenger revenue: enhancing our revenue management processes, optimizing our network and schedule and improving our United Express operation. I'd like to provide you with an update on each of these areas.","First, in revenue management, our booking curve optimization initiative increased third quarter PRASM by 1 point. Additionally, our recently restructured premium cabin fares on many of our domestic and short-haul Latin flights added 0.5 point of PRASM in the third quarter and increased the premium payload factor on these routes by 12 points year-over-year to 40%. Second, our recent changes to the network and schedule are improving the bottom line as well. In the second quarter, for example, we significantly reduced flying from Cleveland and realized the full effects of this change to the network in the third quarter. We expect the run rate annual benefit of this change to be approximately $60 million.","We are making progress on other network and schedule initiatives, including our redesign of the flight bank structure at our hubs in Chicago, Denver and Houston. We implemented the newly rebanked schedule in Denver at the end of September, and we'll follow with Houston late this year and Chicago in March of 2015. This phased rebanking will allow for optimal peaking across the network during the high-demand summer period next year. Additionally, we continue to increase the seasonality of our flying. We view seasonal shaping as an additional step in our commitment to capacity discipline. By adding more flying to the peak summer travel period and reducing flying during the lower-demand shoulder period, we expect to improve our yield over the full year. This will be most notable in the trans-Atlantic markets. For example, in July 2015, we will fly over 40% more trans-Atlantic capacity compared to February 2015, while we expect our full year trans-Atlantic capacity in 2015 to continue to reflect appropriate capacity discipline. We expect this seasonal sculpting of capacity to generate almost 0.5 point of PRASM improvement in our trans-Atlantic entity for the full year of 2015.","This quarter, we launched a new initiative to consolidate departure frequencies throughout the network. Frequency consolidation will reduce costs, improve reliability, improve the product offering and provide more premium seating. As an example, in January, with our Denver-to-Minneapolis route, we are reducing service from 5 flights per day, comprised of a mix of express and mainline aircraft, to 4 flights per day, comprised exclusively of mainline flying on weekdays. In this example, we are only increasing our daily seats by 3% while increasing seats per departure by approximately 30%. We've already implemented similar changes in other routes in Chicago and Newark. The effect of these changes will be seen throughout the network, as we plan on increasing gauge by 5% in 2015 while reducing departures by 3%. The effect will be most pronounced in Chicago, which we will -- which will see average daily departures drop approximately up to 8% and seats per departure increase up to 10% in some months. This not only drives efficiency-related margin improvement but also helps to better manage the congested airspace around O'Hare.","Third, we continue to make good progress on improving our United Express operation. This quarter, we announced that we will add 50 incremental 2-cabin E175s to our fleet and we will remove 31 Q400 propeller aircraft, beginning in 2015. Including these regional fleet changes, we expect to have 85 E175s in our fleet by the end of next year. Our continued progression to more modern, consistent, fuel-efficient and larger-gauge regional aircraft will improve the operational and revenue performance of our express operation while substantially improving our product offering. For each 50-seat aircraft an E175 is replacing, we expect to generate over $1 million of annual improved profitability.","In summary, we are pleased with the initial progress of our three-pronged revenue initiative, but we recognize that it will take some time before we realize the full benefits.","Before turning to fourth quarter revenue guidance, I would first like to remind you of a 1.5 point PRASM tailwind we received in the fourth quarter of 2013. As we explained in our fourth quarter 2013 traffic releases, this tailwind was due to certain interline ticket reconciliations. As this was onetime in nature, we will be facing a 1.5 point PRASM headwind in the fourth quarter this year. Taking this into account, we expect our unit revenue to be essentially flat in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.","The domestic entity continues to display strong demand in the fourth quarter. Continued capacity discipline has supported consistent unit revenue growth in the last several quarters, and we expect domestic strength to continue into the fourth quarter.","The Atlantic region is demonstrating improved capacity discipline in the winter period. In the Atlantic, we expect that the United joint venture with Lufthansa and Air Canada will reduce trans-Atlantic capacity by approximately 0.5% this winter, with United down 3%.","As previously mentioned, our Pacific strategy is yielding solid results. However, we continue to see roughly 20% competitive capacity growth between the U.S. from both Shanghai and Beijing, which is putting pressure on our unit revenue performance as peak summer demand tapers off. Additionally, the weakening yen is applying renewed pressure on our Narita flying. We expect the combination of these 2 factors, as well as increasing stage lengths due to our newly launched margin-accretive Pacific routes, to provide approximately 1.5% headwind to our consolidated PRASM performance for the fourth quarter.","In spite of these challenges, the Pacific remains a solidly profitable entity for United and continues to be one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. United is the best-positioned U.S. carrier to capitalize on this growth in the future.","In the Latin markets, we will grow our capacity in the fourth quarter, along with many of our peers. We expect to grow our seasonal capacity by double digits in the high-demand fourth quarter, driven primarily by capacity expansion in the beach markets. This fourth quarter, seasonal growth allows us to more opportunistically and efficiently redeploy marginal capacity from elsewhere in the network on a seasonal and day-of-week basis. However, as is often the case with significant capacity additions, we expect to face PRASM pressure in the Latin entity in the fourth quarter but believe these additions will be profit maximizing for the overall network.","Turning to our consolidated capacity. We expect our consolidated capacity in the fourth quarter to grow 0.5% to 1.5% year-over-year. As we look toward 2015, we expect to grow consolidated capacity by 1.5% to 2.5% for the full year, with 0.5% to 1.5% growth in our domestic entity. This growth will be very efficient. Approximately half of this growth will come from the installation of slimline seats and up-gauging of aircraft. The remaining growth will come largely from increasing the utilization of our fleet as our improving operation permits us to reduce spares and the completion of aircraft modification programs allows us to return aircraft to regular service. At United, we remain committed to growing capacity below GDP, as we believe this strategy will generate the best opportunity for margin expansion.","In conclusion, I am pleased with our continued improvement in revenue management, network planning and our express operation, and am excited about the many significant opportunities we have ahead of us.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory L. Hart","Thanks, Jim.","I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their tremendous efforts in the third quarter. This quarter presented many unexpected operational challenges, like the fire at the FAA facility in Aurora, and we appreciate their hard work and dedication to transforming United into a more efficient flyer-friendly airline.","At United, we are reinventing the airline from an operational standpoint and are focused on becoming better and more efficient in everything we do. Over the last year, we have transformed our approach to the business. We don't take past practices as a given. Instead, we challenge ourselves to find new and better ways for everything we do each and every day. When we talk about reinventing the business from an operations perspective, we think of it in 3 broad categories: reducing variability, leveraging technology to improve our handling of irregular operations and streamlining and simplifying our operations.","We have many initiatives underway to reduce the variability in our operations. One example is more effectively positioning spare parts into the appropriate stations where they are needed. Through this effort, we've reduced spare parts-related cancellations in the third quarter by more than 20% year-over-year. This improvement in reliability allows us to reduce the number of spare aircraft, which in turn improves fleet utilization and revenue.","We are also taking steps to improve our reaction to and recovery from irregular operations, which are largely driven by weather and air traffic control delays. Our goal is to more effectively run the operation during irregular events and then rebuild our airline as soon as the event passes. To improve the operation during such events, we are deploying technology solutions to more strategically cancel flights in more opportunistically route passengers around impacted regions. We are also developing new mobile tools for our airport agents to more quickly assist passengers during irregular operations. For example, these tools will allow roaming agents to scan boarding passengers in order to quickly assist passengers in determining optimal rerouting opportunities.","We also have significant opportunities to streamline and simplify our operations. There are numerous initiatives underway focused on driving efficiencies through simplification. As mentioned on the previous earnings call, we are reducing the number of express carriers operating in each hub. At the same time, we are reducing express fleet combinations in several airports. As an example, in Washington Dulles, we are going from 8 express aircraft types down to 5. These simplification efforts allow us to reduce the number of express maintenance spaces by nearly 25% through base consolidation.","While we are proud of the improvements we are making in the operation, we're excited about the many opportunities we have to make us a more reliable and efficient airline. With our assets, dedicated employees and ability to execute, we expect to continue to improve our operation over the coming quarters.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Rainey","Thanks, Greg. And thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning.","I want to reiterate my appreciation to the United team for their hard work this quarter. Throughout the company, our employees are making meaningful improvements to United, and I appreciate their efforts.","Today, we reported $1.1 billion of pretax income for the third quarter. Our third quarter earnings per diluted share were $2.75, nearly double our earnings per share in the third quarter of last year. Our return on invested capital over the trailing 12-month period reached 12.3%, the highest result in the last 3 years. Our operating margin was 11.7% and our pretax margin was 10.2%, both more than 450 basis points higher than last year. We're pleased with the continued financial improvement we've made, and we're excited about our opportunity to significantly grow earnings. We are all working hard to increase our revenue and improve our efficiency to generate the level of earnings we and our shareholders expect.","Our third quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, increased 1% year-over-year. We are continuing to make good progress on our Project Quality initiative. This year, we expect to achieve nearly $200 million of fuel savings and now expect over $300 million of nonfuel savings. Our full year estimate for both of these numbers has increased with each quarter this year as we continued to perform better than our original expectations.","A key component of the nonfuel savings is productivity, and we continue to make great progress in this area. This quarter, we improved productivity by 4%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter in which our productivity has increased, keeping us on track to achieve our 2014 goal of a 3% improvement. We expect fourth quarter nonfuel CASM to increase between 1.25% and 2.25%, resulting in a full year CASM estimate in line with our original guidance despite a 1 point reduction in our capacity projection that we provided at the beginning of the year.","In the third quarter, we returned $220 million to shareholders through a combination of an accelerated share repurchase program and open-market transactions. We are pleased with the early progress we've made on our $1 billion share buyback program, and we will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares over the coming quarters.","We're making good progress improving our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we redeemed the entire $800 million of our 6.75% secured notes. At the same time, we closed on a transaction under our existing $1.9 billion credit facility, in which we increased the size of our undrawn revolver by $350 million to a total of $1.35 billion and also issued an additional $500 million tranche of term loan debt.","We've also made meaningful progress in reducing our convertible debt. Earlier this month, we retired all $248 million of our 6% convertible preferred securities due in 2030. We also issued a redemption notice for the remaining $56 million of our 6% convertible debt due in 2029. Furthermore, in January 2015, the $202 million outstanding of our 4.5% convertible notes will mature. Following that maturity, we will no longer have any outstanding convertible debt. This represents a $1.9 billion reduction in convertible debt since the merger.","These transactions are representative of our stated long-term goal to reduce gross debt to $15 billion while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity.","Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were $493 million, and in the fourth quarter, we expect to spend approximately $1 billion. We plan to take delivery of 5 737-900ERs, 1 787-8, 1 787-9 and 11 E175s in the quarter. Apart from the additional E175s that Jim already mentioned, earlier in the quarter, we announced an agreement with Boeing to convert 7 787-8s delivering between 2017 and 2018 into larger, more efficient 787-10s that will be delivered in 2022 and beyond. In addition, we recently decided to retain 11 767-300ER aircraft that we had originally planned to retire and will invest in these aircraft with new interiors, winglets and reliability modifications to extend the useful life of these aircraft into the next decade.","In addition, we continue to explore the used-aircraft market to find suitable aircraft that will allow us to reduce CapEx and rightsize our fleet without substantially increasing fleet complexity. For example, we recently reached an agreement to purchase 2 used 737-700s to backfill flying as 50-seaters exit the fleet. These changes to the fleet plan demonstrate our discipline in managing our capital allocation.","I'm encouraged by our third quarter performance and the progress we're making to expand revenue, reduce costs, improve the balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. Through these actions, we're expanding earnings and demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.","I'll now turn it over to Jonathan to open up the call for questions.","Jonathan Ireland","Thank you, John. First, we will take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker on the line.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","GDP forecasts keep changing on an almost daily basis. Can you just talk about the leverage you have to adjust capacity either if GDP slows from current forecasts for next year, or accelerates?","James E. Compton","Helane, this is Jim. We have a history of creating a flexible fleet plan. And that is, clearly, as we head into 2015, we have the ability to adjust our capacity to economic changes. We kind of gauge GDP forecast based on consensus out there, so you're right, it does move around, but we do have the ability, with utilization of the aircraft, working really closely with our tech ops team to more finely tune when we can do work on airplanes, to also adjust to that. So the history of a flexible fleet plan continues for us, and we have great flexibility to adjust to the economic environment, and we will. We'll -- it is about keeping demand and capacity in line, and that's what we're really focused on.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up question to that capacity comment you made about Chicago going to more seats per departure and fewer departures per day. Are you worried that competitors will come in and backfill what you're doing with additional capacity?","John D. Rainey","Helane, it's really -- it's obviously a very competitive business that we're in. And so that schedule that we'll be building in Chicago will be a very attractive schedule to the business passenger as well as the leisure passenger. So we're confident with the seat growth that we applied by up-gauging that we'll be very competitive in the market.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker on the line.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You basically halved the operating margin deficit relative to Delta, but it looks like you're guiding for a bit of slippage in the fourth quarter. You have explained why. That's fine. If we'd set aside the first quarter of next year, where we at least hope that you're going to have ridiculously easy weather comps, in what quarter next year do you expect the initiatives that you've been talking about here to be showing the most relative momentum to the industry? And furthermore, do you have an internal target as to where you'd want your relative margins to be by the end of next year? And I'm not trying to pry guidance out of you. I'm just curious as to whether you believe you can achieve margin parity with other best-in-class operators. If you think you can, when?","John D. Rainey","Jamie, this is John. I'll tell you I can't predict necessarily what other carriers are going to do. I'm going to tell you that we're focused on United Airlines and what we can do to create value for our shareholders. We recognize we have some further improving to do. This was a record profit for us this quarter. Our guidance in the fourth quarter would lead you to what is also a record profit for United in the fourth quarter. We talked about our desire to make money in the first quarter, and we want to continue to expand earnings. We are only about 25% of the way through our Project Quality initiative. We're in the very early stages of our revenue initiative. And so we think that we've got a lot of improvement, a lot of opportunity in front of us. We would all like to close that margin gap as soon as possible. I promise you that the team here is extremely focused on it. We don't like our relative place in the industry. That's a fact. And we think that we've got a lot of opportunity to improve.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Excellent. And a follow-up for Jim Compton. Ultimately, Jim, what solved the China problem? And I only ask because, again bringing up Delta, I think they have a decent solution for Tokyo longer term. It's called Seattle. But in your case, it's tough for me to see what you can actually do about China until such time that your competitors there suddenly wake up and choose to focus on returns. I mean, is there a better Chinese strategy other than simply hope?","James E. Compton","Jamie, we're -- obviously, China is a big part of our network and very profitable part of our network. It's a very strong, growing part of the world. From a demand perspective, we continue to expect that. So our footprint there, we think, is the best positioned. I'll tell you we don't -- our strategy is well beyond hope. And if you think about the things that we're doing with the flexibility of our fleet, the 787 San Francisco to Chengdu is a perfect example of that, that we're tapping into that growth in China in ways that, quite frankly, our competitors can't as we continue to match capacity and demand. So we call it our second phase of our Pacific. That's combined with what we're doing in Tokyo with our JV partner to put the flying out of Narita, work with them much close down [ph] the connections, but as it is in China, we're well positioned. And we feel we have lots of opportunity to do well as that market continues to grow.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is there much regulatory appetite for potential JV immunization with Chinese carriers?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Jamie, this is Jeff. We're not going to be able to get JVs with, for example, our partner in China until China goes open skies, as that -- but with whatever period of time it takes. Clearly, that's something we would be keenly interested in were we do have the regulatory authority to do that, but we don't have that yet.","James E. Compton","And Jamie, I would add to Jeff's comments. Working with their [ph] China, some of the success of Chengdu being ahead of our expectations is the connections that they're building for us in Chengdu. So we'll continue to work that from an alliance perspective with our Star partners.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","A question for John. I don't mean for this to sound antagonistic at all, I don't, but I can't think of another way to ask it. So if a company doesn't qualify for hedge accounting, doesn't that mean that the company is just speculating with commodity derivatives that don't correlate to the price of the commodities that they use?","John D. Rainey","Not necessarily, Jamie. The accounting rules around getting hedge accounting treatment, I'll give you one example. If you don't have an equal number of bought and sold call and put positions, that doesn't allow you to get hedge accounting. You have to -- so for example, if you did a caller -- a bought call and a sold put, you get hedge accounting, but if you were to then go out and mitigate the costs of that by selling a call at the high end, say, a $140 Brent [ph], that precludes you being able to get hedge accounting. I'll tell you that our hedge philosophy here is one of risk management. This is our single largest expense. It represents $12 billion to $13 billion for us annually. We think that taking some risk off the table in the near term is a prudent thing to do. We've -- I -- we've had this discussion before with you. I know that, philosophically, we agree that, long term, the industry needs to be able to adjust capacity and, therefore, its prices to compensate for its price inputs. Given the nature of our business, that we sell tickets 330 days in advance, that we schedule employees for many months in advance sometimes, it's difficult to adjust capacity in the very near term, which is why our hedge position is more heavily weighted call set.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","And a little bit more on the previous question. In terms of open skies with China, Jeff, do you believe that a pacing item for open skies to occur -- because if you look at prior open skies agreements with the Japanese and with the EU, it's some sort of free-market concept for slot-controlled airports, so is it fair to assume that we should pretty much never assume China is ever going to grant open skies because they're not going to relinquish control over slots at Beijing and Shanghai?","Jeffery A. Smisek","I don't know. It's a good question, Hunter, and I don't know the answer to it. I think that, that's going to require work by U.S. carriers pushing our own government to be flexible and to make sure that there are a fair allocation of slots to U.S. carriers. And as I -- as you allude to, our government's experience with Japan, in particular with Haneda, is a good example of that. That's a difficult process. What I -- I wasn't predicting necessarily a near-term open skies agreement with China. I was just saying that, if there were one, it would be necessary. That's a predicate to having a joint venture.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg on the line.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple here. Jim, appreciate that you gave us the quarterly PRASM guide and highlighted the headwind. Can you give us maybe an early read on October? And I'm asking because I know, last year, we did have the government shutdown. And as I recall, I think that was a -- maybe it was a 1 point, 1.5 points headwind. Any color on October, how things are shaping up?","James E. Compton","Mike, to be -- we're not -- don't comment on a specific month, but you're right just in terms of last year with the government shutdown in the beginning of the month and then it's coming back about October 16 last year. There was clearly, from a government traffic as well as business traffic associated with government-type fares, strength year-over-year in that area. And we did see that so far in October. We're now back to year-over-year where the government shutdown was over.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just my second question, on the seasonal shaping. As we move into the early part of 2015, conceptually, it does make a lot of sense to really ramp up when demand is strongest, but given the adjustments there on capacity, you highlighted the trans-Atlantic numbers, can you talk about just some of the potential execution risks here? I mean is this -- could we see this go very wrong? Or do you feel like you have the systems, the controls, the ability to move people around? I mean I know there've been some structural changes, like on how you staff up at airports, for example, and the way some of the new contracts have been structured. I mean just highlight some of the things that we should be looking for so that we know that -- to go from X to X plus 20% on capacity, in particular markets, that you're operating well.","James E. Compton","Mike, this is Jim again. The -- what we're doing with the seasonal capacity turn [ph] is a process internally that we've started a long time ago. And by that, I mean the network planning group has worked hand-in-hand with our operations folks. Because you're right, there is a lot of coordination in terms of having utilization of the aircraft there, the crews and so forth; and the ability for the stations to handle the schedule. So we're really confident where we're at in this because the process began a long time ago and we're right on time line for the execution to go very well. And we're excited about it because, obviously, that peak summer demand will drive -- for the full year, we talk about adding 0.5 point of PRASM to our trans-Atlantic entity in 2015 with this network change that we're doing.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have a John Godyn on the line.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one on costs and one on capacity. First, on costs. John, you had some good commentary about how you're tracking versus the cost-reduction plan that was announced toward the end of 2013. I'm curious if you could just speak to whether opportunities are being pushed forward or outright upside to the plan is being created and how we might revise the sort of $1 billion fuel and $1 billion x fuel numbers if in fact there is now being sort of upside being found?","John D. Rainey","John, it's a good question. And I would characterize our progress thus far as really more -- the opportunity has been greater than what we expected on the initiatives that we've embarked on rather than sliding forward initiatives. There have been some exceptions, but they -- those go both ways. When you get into this, some things take longer than you expect, and some things, you can accelerate. But generally, what we've seen is, where there had been opportunities, we've exceeded our expectations. And I really credit the employees for this. This is just, across-the-board, you see every single work group where there's a real drive for efficiency. I'll give you an example: In the third quarter, overtime in our maintenance group was about 2 points better year-over-year. And that doesn't really mean much just in terms of dollars in that statement, but 1 point in overtime change for maintenance is about $10 million to $12 million annually. And this is just really running a better, more efficient operation, and you see that in the bottom line. And that's one example. We see it in our res [ph] group. We see it in our airport groups. We've got better staffing with our flight attendants. There's really a huge drive across the company, and clearly, everyone is on board.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And if this is really sort of -- momentum and a cultural dynamic in the background, it sounds like it could last even for the next few years. I wonder, is it possible that, by the end of this plan, we find that we're hundreds of millions of dollars above the $1 billion x fuel and $1 billion fuel that you outlined at the end of 2013?","Jeffery A. Smisek","John, this is Jeff. I mean one of the things -- the point you make is a very good point. One thing is that this Project Quality is designed to deliver $2 billion of efficiencies annual cost savings by 2017, but it's not going to end in 2017. What we're instilling here is a culture of efficiency and continuous improvement, something that this industry has woefully lacked, candidly. And so we have -- we -- this is a first step of what we're doing. We have a lot of confidence in achieving our -- the goals that we set forth at in November of 2013, but it won't stop in 2017. This is a way of thinking. This is a way of questioning how and why we do things and how we can do things more efficiently, better for our employees, better for our customers and clearly better for our bottom line.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And if I could just ask a question on capacity. Jim, you offered a lot of sort of tactical commentary in the short term about how you're managing different market dynamics, but when I think about the 2015 guidance and the fact that you're still growing a bit faster in international than in domestic, I just wonder. Is there appetite for maybe more structural change to how you think about international versus domestic? Because your overweight position in international still comes up as one of the largest risk factors, at least in my conversations with investors.","James E. Compton","John, this is Jim. Your -- the capacity guidance, let me put a little context around the international piece of 2015 because, as we've talked a lot about the seasonal shaping of trans-Atlantic, that really implies really low single-digit capacity growth for the Atlantic entity in 2015. As you think about Latin America, in terms of routes that make a lot of sense for us to complete our portfolio, we are beginning this year adding Houston-to-Santiago. It's, for a long time, been a big ask from our corporate partners, to serve that market. So we're very excited about it. So 2015, in that sense, becomes a run rate of that new market that we're very excited about. So it's very strategic in terms of what we're trying to do from a business side. We also are starting in this year Denver-to-Panama, and so the run rate of that market is also going to grow. And then the rest is -- what I mentioned in my script is we're seeing really strong demands in the beach markets. And so for instance, we can take a Chicago-LaGuardia trip on a Saturday and fly from Chicago to Cancun on that same Saturday. And well, it generates a lot of incremental capacity into Latin America, but from a margin perspective, it's actually very accretive. So the way we think of this of all is in the context of what we're trying to do strategically: beat capacity discipline, build on our strengths and do that with different levers. And one of the levers is some of the seasonality. And so when you think about the Latin, you kind of get into mid-single-digit type of growth in that area with what I described. In the Pacific, just to close that out, we're really excited about starting L.A.-Melbourne this year, and you're going to have the run rate of that. And again, it's as much about ultimately getting out of our tag Sydney-to-Melbourne. That is very expensive for us to operate but allows us to serve Melbourne. The 787-9 becomes the great airplane to South [ph] that will help out run rate capacity in there. And then we have the run rate of San Francisco to Chengdu and San Fran to Taipei on capacity that I have already noted is running ahead of expectations. That kind of gets us in the mid-single digits in the Pacific. So the international capacity, we think fits very well with our capacity discipline, although because of the run rate and some of the things we're doing to beach markets, generates capacity next year at the levels that maybe you're inferring.","Operator","From Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, we have Julie Yates on the line.","Julie Yates Stewart - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I realize it's a little early to be giving 2015 cost guidance and you guys are still in the middle of your budgeting process, but from a high level, how should we be thinking about the nonfuel unit cost growth in 2015, especially in light of the fact that Project Quality seems to be going a little bit better than you originally expected?","John D. Rainey","Julie, we've characterized our cost goal as being one where we expect to grow nonfuel costs at something less than inflation. And I appreciate that's a little bit vague, as inflation can bounce around. It's a long-term goal, and we may see that. We may see cost pressures from 1 year to the next, which will cause that to vary. We are, as Jim alluded to, growing more next year than what we did this year. It's obviously easier to keep that number lower, as you're supported by some growth. So we're sticking to that goal. We'll give more clarity at -- over the coming quarter about what our 2015 number is, but we're extremely encouraged by the early progress that we've seen this year. I talked about in my prepared remarks the fact that, despite capacity coming down a full point versus our original expectations, we've been able to hit our cost goals. And so I expect that to bleed over to 2015, and the same performance that we've seen this year will continue into the next year.","Julie Yates Stewart - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on labor. Is there any update on reaching a single contract with either the flight attendant or the technician groups?","Gregory L. Hart","This is Greg. We remain in negotiations with our flight attendants. And I'm sure you all saw that we went [indiscernible] our programs [ph] with our flight attendants, which has been very, very well received. And we help -- we hope that is a bridge for an agreement with our flight attendants, which we expect to have happen sometime next year. We are still working with our technicians and obviously are very focused on getting a deal done with those folks as soon as we can as well.","Julie Yates Stewart - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then how much of a tailwind on labor productivity is it to reach the single contract on the flight attendant side?","John D. Rainey","I'm not sure I understand your question, Julie.","Julie Yates Stewart - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Once you get to the single contract with the flight attendants, I would imagine that you'll be able to recognize greater labor productivity from staffing.","John D. Rainey","Right, well, the specifics of the contract, we're still working on. Obviously, we -- there are some inefficiencies just in our system today by having 2 separate collective bargaining agreements with the inefficiencies of staffing, transportation cost, hotels, things like that. So we do expect some benefit from that, but we haven't necessarily quantified that.","Operator","From Evercore, we have Duane Pfennigwerth on the line.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of fuel questions, if I could. This move down we've had here, 2 90 [ph] to 2 40 [ph], 2 50 [ph] jet, before taxes and fees, a pretty sharp move. How has that changed your plans, if at all, for 2015 or maybe for the fourth quarter? Does that sort of relate at all to sort of the stage length increase, which is probably implied by that fuel efficiency? And then could you just give us a sense for where you are from a hedge book perspective and the degree to which you're participating in this downward move into 2015?","John D. Rainey","Sure. So let me take the last part of your question first, if that's okay. For the fourth quarter, we're 39% hedged. And over the next 12 months, we're about 35% hedged. In terms of our participation, in the fourth quarter, we are participating about 70% to the upside and the downside in fuel movements. And for the 2015, that's more like 80%. So help -- hopefully that helps. In terms of our hedge strategy, our hedge strategy is, part of it has been to be responsive to the overall fuel market. And over the last few years, you've seen that fuel has been relatively ranged bound, and our hedge portfolio has reflected that fact. And I think we fared better than any of our competitors over that period of time. We've seen fuel break out of that range, and I think we're very early on in this. We will look to see if it stabilizes and a new trading band develops, and then our hedge structure will respond to that.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then maybe I missed it. Have you offered CapEx guidance for next year yet?","John D. Rainey","We have not. We did talk about at Investor Day last year, Duane, our long-term goal of about $2.8 billion to $3 billion over the next few years. We have made some changes. I talked a little bit about some of the changes we've made from a fleet perspective. So that, we would expect that number to move around a little bit. But we'll give you more guidance on that as we get closer to year-end.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I -- it sounds like -- correct me if I'm wrong. It sounds like that pushed some aircraft out, so maybe the bias on that is down. And then just lastly, on the buyback, I think, when you initially announced it, $1 billion over 3 years, and you've taken down over $200 million in the first quarter, so it looks like you'll finish that in a year. Can you just give us a sense for when you would choose to update us on the authorization and how we should be thinking about that timing?","John D. Rainey","Well, we're going to take this in steps, Duane. I'm pleased with the fact that we're almost 1\/4 of the way through this early on. We've seen some -- a lot of volatility in the market, and it has created some buying opportunities for us. We still think this is a great way to return cash to shareholders given where our stock is trading right now, but I've emphasized before, this is a first step. And when we complete this, or get close to completion, we'll come back to the market with our next step, but I'm not prepared to talk any more about that at this point in time.","Operator","And from Barclays, we have David Fintzen on the line.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe a question for John. Just appreciate maybe getting a little ahead of '15 here, but if I look at your absolute nonfuel cost growth, in the last few quarters, you've kept it right around 1 [ph], if not below, in some quarters. As we get out to '15, and obviously there's still a lot to go on Project Quality, are there some other inflationary cost pressures that tick up in '15 versus '14 that would materially start to change that absolute cost profile? Or -- I'm just trying to think through some of the moving pieces into next year.","John D. Rainey","Good question, David. There are a couple headwinds. I do not expect it to change that profile. The best example I can give you right now relates to pension. So the discount rate that we use today to discount the liabilities in our pension is about 5.1%. The preliminary look for next year, it looks like it'll be closer to 4.3%, so that will create between $50 million and $100 million of headwind for us next year. There's also an update to the mortality tables for pensions, which is not reflected in our current numbers. But that said, even with those headwinds, we expect to achieve the type of cost performance that we've outlined, so I don't expect it to change the profile that you alluded to.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then maybe a quick one for Jim, on the China -- on the Chinese capacity growth. It's obviously coming from a lot of arguably lesser-known brands from a U.S. perspective. How effective are some of these carriers at competing in the U.S. point of sale?","James E. Compton","Well, clearly, their point of sale is more a Chinese point of sale. And -- but I like to -- every competitor is a good competitor, and our goal in competing is to obviously operate and do -- at a really high reliability rate, with a great product. And -- but our point of sale on the U.S. side is stronger than the Chinese point of sale, and you have that dynamic for them also on their side. And clearly, you're right, they're building a brand presence as they grow their presence into the U.S. And so United, with since 1986 being in the market in China, has a strong presence over there to date.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Thomson Reuters, we have Jeffrey Dastin on the line.","Jeffrey Dastin","Could you elaborate on the 787-10's conversion? Will there essentially be deferred 787 deliveries?","John D. Rainey","Well, our current plan is to defer the deliveries that we expected to take in 2017 and '18 into 2022. We still do hold option positions. Jeff -- or rather, Jim alluded to the fact that fleet flexibility is something that's very important for us to be able to respond to the economic environment yet still do so in a capacity-disciplined manner. But that was the move that we've recently made, yes.","Operator","From Flightglobal Media, we have Edward Russell on the line.","Edward Russell","Could you elaborate a bit more on the -- looking at used aircraft, first of all, where the 737s you purchased are coming from? And then also, are you looking for narrowbodies, or widebodies?","John D. Rainey","Sure. The 737-700s that we obtained were from a leasing company. I don't want to comment on any further on the airline that they came from. But the other part of your question: At this point, we're really more focused on narrowbody lift. Part of the issue that we're solving for is, today, we are too reliant on the 50-seat RJ. It's -- it creates some operational complexities, but there's also, I think, a looming shortage with respect to pilots being able to fly some of those as we look at some of the changes in the training requirements. So what we want to do is backfill some of that capacity in a financially disciplined way. We don't necessarily want to go out and place a brand-new aircraft order that creates several billion dollars more of CapEx. We've talked a lot about having a balanced allocation of cash flow. So this is a way, by looking at the used-aircraft market, that we can still backfill some of that capacity, more narrowbody focused, but do it while still addressing the other cash flow needs that we have.","Edward Russell","All right. And can we infer also that you're looking for aircraft that are currently in your fleet, or models at least?","John D. Rainey","That's accurate. Any time you look at adding a plane or a new fleet type, there's some complexity with that. There has been some discussion about the 190s. That's something that is on the radar candidly as well. But certainly, if you look at our narrowbody fleet with the Airbus A319s, A320s, the new Jin 737s, those are all planes that fit the profile that we could easily accommodate into our fleet.","Irene E. Foxhall","Okay, thanks, everybody. We'll conclude now. We appreciate you all joining us on the call. Please call media relations if you have any further questions.

Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Leskinen","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com.","Information in yesterday\u2019s release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company\u2019s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures.

This winning streak allowed us to reach our 2020 adjusted EPS target of $11 to \u2013 $11 to $13 per share, one full-year ahead of schedule.","This incredible performance would not have been possible without the dedication of the finest collection of airline professionals in the world. So I want to thank the 96,000 members of the United family, who work so hard to serve our customers. I\u2019m also pleased that they were sharing our success with a profit-sharing payment that\u2019s on average 45% higher than last year.","With all that we\u2019ve had to overcome in 2019, there\u2019s no group of airline employees in the world that is more deserving. You\u2019ll hear more details about our financial performance from Scott and Gerry, but I also want to include, I\u2019ll quickly touch on our fourth quarter results.","Our adjusted earnings per share of $2.67 was 11% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. This reflects 50 basis points of adjusted pre-tax margin expansion in this last fourth quarter, which as I mentioned, is the fourth consecutive quarter that our pre-tax margin has grown, and the fifth consecutive quarter on an adjusted basis.","As you\u2019ll hear today, we\u2019re all quite proud of what we accomplished last year, but I\u2019m most excited about what it means for our ability to plan and deliver for our customers, employees and over the long-term. And that also includes the announcement that we made at the end of 2019 about the leadership of this company, with keeping this bright future in mind.","Thinking back to where United was when I took over as CEO in September of 2015 and where we are today, this company\u2019s success is a testament to the power of long-term commitment to our proved not promise philosophy. By every metric and benchmark by which the health and strength of our company is measured and judged, the United of today finds itself in a much stronger position than the United four years ago.","I made it a personal priority to guarantee our future by assembling a deep bench of talent in order to give our customers, employee base and investors confidence in our direction and leadership.","Today, I\u2019m 100% confident that we have the absolute best leadership team any airline hands down, taking advantage of that talent and cumulative experience by initiating a deliberate, well-planned and transparent transition is what healthy companies do and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing between now and the end of May, when I\u2019ll assume my new role as Executive Chairman.","It was important for us to preserving this continuity and my partnership with Scott means we\u2019ll continue to work on capitalizing the bright future that lays head, not just in 2020, but through the new decade. That\u2019s why we\u2019re eagerly anticipating the chance to get together for Investor Day in March to share more about that long-term strategy.","So with that, Scott, over to you.","Scott Kirby","Thanks. I\u2019d like to start by thanking you, Oscar, for all that you\u2019ve done for United and for me personally in the last five years. United is a totally different airline today than it was when Oscar became the CEO. Oscar made it his mission to change the culture of United by bringing the people of United together as a team. He put the customer at the center of our decision-making and created an innovative, fast-paced environment, where we seek to make the airline better every day and in every way.","For me personally, Oscar has been a mentor and a friend. From day one, Oscar was direct, reminding me that there was more to our business than numbers. Many corporate executives talk about the importance of employees and customers. Oscar doesn\u2019t just talk about it, he lives it 24\/7. I will be a much better CEO and person, because Oscar reinforced the importance of focusing not only the numbers, but also our employees and customers.","Leading by example, as Oscar has, is the only way to truly change a culture and make a difference. I\u2019m fortunate to have the opportunity to step into Oscar\u2019s big shoes as part of a planned and thoughtful transition. And even after as Executive Chairman, Oscar won\u2019t be far away, as we continue on the path toward building the best airline in the world.","That great path is delivering results, and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what the team accomplished in 2019. We once again achieved our guidance metrics and reached our 2020 adjusted EPS goal a year early. We\u2019ve done that by creating a culture of teamwork across the entire company and focus \u2013 by focusing on doing the right thing for our customers.","You\u2019ll hear more today from Greg Hart, our Chief Operating Officer, who\u2019s pinch-hitting for Toby, who is ill today; and then Andrew Nocella, our Chief Customer \u2013 our Chief Commercial Officer, on some of the things we\u2019re doing to improve the customer experience.","2019 demonstrates the resilience and potential of United Airlines. We faced a number of significant headwinds last year, started out with a longer-than-expected government shutdown; the grounding of the MAX; and geopolitical issues in places like China, Iran and Pakistan, among others. Rather than use those \u2013 the headwinds as excuses, however, the United team simply buckled down and persevered. It wasn\u2019t easy and we weren\u2019t perfect, but we didn\u2019t use the bad stuff as an excuse.","That\u2019s one reason I view 2019 is a really good proof point of where we\u2019re headed in 2020. To be able to grow full-year adjusted EPS by 32%, the adjusted pre-tax margins by 170 basis points, despite all those headwinds is pretty remarkable. We know 2020 will come with its own unique set of challenges. In fact, a couple have cropped up in just the last 48 hours. We won\u2019t make excuses for those either.","We also can\u2019t sit here and tell you that we know exactly how long the MAX will be grounded or what the economic impact of the Asian coronavirus would be. The safety impact of the coronavirus is, of course, our foremost concern. We\u2019ve been coordinating closely with the CDC to ensure that we\u2019re taking all the necessary steps to ensure that our customers and employees can travel safely.","At this point, public health agencies are not recommending any travel restrictions, but we\u2019ll follow their advice closely, because they and we have some experience with situations like this.","By working closely together, we have, in the past, effectively managed situations like this one to keep our people safe. And in doing so, we\u2019ve seen demand bounce back. Managing through uncertainty is something that every airline in the world has to do. And here at United, our formula isn\u2019t complicated, put safety first and focus on delivery for our customers. Our team executed that strategy beautifully last year, and it\u2019s important part of why we\u2019re so confident about what lies ahead in 2020 and beyond.","In closing, I\u2019m truly honored to be given the chance to lead this great team. All of us at United are committed to making this the best airline in the world. You\u2019ll hear more on the call today and in our Investor Day in March about some of what\u2019s ahead in the long-term. But we\u2019re all excited and committed to getting better every day for our customers, employees and shareholders.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory Hart","Thanks, Scott. At United, our focus is to ensure our customers have a great experience with United across their entire travel journey. Consistency is key, as we deliver caring service to every customer on every flight every day. With that in mind, I\u2019d like to thank our over 160 million customers from around the world, whether you\u2019re taking an important business trip or a well-deserved personal vacation. We know you have multiple airlines to choose from, and we truly appreciate your business.","Improving our customer experience works hand in hand with our growth strategy, strengthening customer loyalty and increasing our feel within travelers. We\u2019re investing in the areas that customers tell us matter most, and we\u2019re seeing positive returns on our customer satisfaction scores. More importantly, customers are increasingly willing to recommend United to their family and friends and that is good for the bottom line.","In 2019, we saw United\u2019s largest ever year-over-year improvement in Net Promoter Scores. Where did this progress come from? As we\u2019ve shared with you over the past year, we\u2019ve made several foundational investments. Perhaps more important than any investments in our hard products, we continued our commitment to Core4 and caring customer service through various employee engagement investments, such as our Backstage 2019 event series, where he brought all of our 25,000 flight attendants to Chicago.","We elevated the flying experience for all travelers by expanding our economy set snack selection and offering free DIRECTV. We launched ConnectionSaver, a new system that identifies flights to hold for customers making tight connections.","We began operating the CRJ-550, offering first-class and Economy Plus sitting \u2013 seating, as well as plenty of carry-on storage space, all on a 50-seat aircraft. Customer feedback has been fantastic. And since its launch, the 550 is delivering our highest customer satisfaction scores on our short-haul routes.","We introduced new benefits for our MileagePlus members with no expiration dates on our miles and offering free or discounted CLEAR memberships to provide an easier, more predictable, secure experience at all of our hubs.","Looking forward, we are even more excited about our portfolio of planned customer-focused investments this year as announced at our meeting day. We\u2019ll begin to upgrade our aircraft interiors, featuring new overhead bins that offer 1:1 bag to customer storage ratio.","We\u2019re updating our single-class 50-seat regional aircraft with new seats and adding personal device entertainment. We\u2019re enhancing our food offering, which includes preorder capabilities. We\u2019ll also be upgrading airport facilities at our hubs and some of our large line stations.","Finally, we\u2019ll continue our commitment to improving customer service. Starting this week, we\u2019ll bring all of our airport and contact center customer service representatives to Backstage 2020, an immersive two-day experience focused on caring for our customers.","The investments we have planned in 2020 are broad, improving the customer experience across many touch points. We\u2019ll try a number of new ideas focused on key markets, quickly entering what is impactful to our customers and then plan to roll out the best ideas more broadly.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it off to Andrew to talk more about our commercial initiatives.","Andrew Nocella","Thanks, Greg. 2020 will be a year where many of our commercial and customer initiatives mature and gain critical consistency. In fact, the year is already off to a nice start. Ticketed revenue per business is strong for the first two full weeks of this year, an encouraging indicator for the rest of the year.","Before going into a few details about early expectations for 2020, let\u2019s review our performance in the last quarter. For the fourth quarter, PRASM grew at 0.8%. Performance at the end of the year was really strong globally and met our PRASM plan with one exception, part today, in which I\u2019ll speak about in a moment.","In fact, the Sunday after Thanksgiving was one for the record books, where system PRASM increased 15% year-over-year, our best day for \u2013 our best day ever. PRASM performance in our domestic network was up 0.6% on a 2.6% increase in capacity in the quarter. This PRASM increase was realized despite the 737 MAX grounding, which limited our Mid-Continent connectivity plans.","International performance was even better than domestic in the quarter with a 1.5% increase in PRASM on a 3.8% increase in capacity. We\u2019re really pleased with the international momentum we\u2019re seeing relative to industry results over the last few months.","Latin America was our best performing international region in the fourth quarter. Latin PRASM increased 6.3% on a 4.4% increase in capacity. Performance across the Pacific sequentially improved in the quarter relative to the third that was still negative. PRASM has decreased 1.2% on a 0.7% decrease in capacity. Almost all the weakness occurred in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. All of these \u2013 all three of these were 2.6 point drag on Pacific performance and a 0.3 point drag on system performance.","Atlantic PRASM was down 0.2% in the quarter on a 7.6% increase in capacity. Due to weakness in the manufacturing sector, Germany point-of-sale demand continued to be soft, particularly for premium business. All of that was partially offset by strong U.S. point-of-sale demand.","Looking ahead for the first quarter 2020, we expect our consolidated passenger unit revenue to be flat to up 2%. Demand in Hong Kong remains difficult to predict. However, I will say that book PRASM for Hong Kong is not expected to be a drag on PRASM results in the first quarter. We\u2019ve also started to see demand trends for Germany stabilize in recent weeks with strong unit demand from industrials, which has been sluggish for most of 2019.","On each conference call, I like to point out a few initiatives we have rolling out and their impacts on the business and our customers. While we\u2019re improving the experience of flying United for all of our customers, many of our commercial initiatives are focused on capturing high premium demand in our hub markets in 2020 and beyond.","The Business Travel News survey, BTN, is a key assessment of how airlines are perceived by corporate buyers and global travel agencies, the primary source of premium business for United. United finished in second place in late 2019 in this important survey, and proven more than ever before in a single year, really distinguishing ourselves from many of our competitors. This survey is a great example of listening and responding effectively to corporate buyers\u2019 needs. Congratulations to both our sales team and our frontline staff we\u2019ve empowered to make this happen.","Premium Plus, our new mid-tier wide-body jet product is ideally suited for our hub markets and created a 0.6 point tailwind for system PRASM in Q4, a slight acceleration versus Q3 and a trend that we expect to continue for most of 2020. We\u2019re also now selling Premium Plus seats on select flights between New York and LA and San Francisco and are seeing great results. Our analysis suggests that Premium Plus is having minimal impact on demand for Polaris business class seats.","For the first-half of 2020, we expect to grow business class capacity across the Atlantic by almost 20%. We had, in the past, undersized business class cabins in key business markets like London Heathrow and Switzerland, while offering too many economy cabin seats. We\u2019re now rightsizing the size of our premium cabins. More business class capacity is yet another initiative proven to help us achieve our full network potential.","2020 will be a big year as we expect to finish most of our planned Polaris seating installations and Polaris clubs. Our Washington Dulles Polaris club is scheduled to open this spring. And by the end of the year, 90% of our wide-body jets are anticipated to have the new Polaris seats, including all of our 777s and 767-300s.","In fact, this past weekend, we loaded our schedule. For May and beyond for all 55 of our 777-200 ERs have new Polaris and new Premium Plus seats selling as of May 8 of this year. We also launched our new cabin upgrade system called PlusPoints in late 2019. The goal is simple to automate upgrades. We create \u2013 we also created a skip-the-waitlist feature for Polaris upgrades that\u2019s available from time to time in different geographies. Currently, it\u2019s available in South America.","We look forward to resuming our Mid-Continent growth plan designed to maximize connectivity once the max is flying again. Even without the MAX, we\u2019re making progress in smaller communities with the addition of the CRJ-550. We also recently modified our Denver bank structure and it\u2019ll be, in fact, this February, and we\u2019re already seeing positive response in our bookings for that change.","I also wanted to take a moment and talk about growth of our ancillary revenues. For the year, we grew ancillary revenues by over 12% on a 3.5% more capacity. As we look deeper into 2020, we expect this momentum to continue as we focus on better ways to distribute Economy Plus. Getting this product on more shelves is one of our highest priorities and a better display on united.com, which is already in beta testing is a first step.","And then another important milestone is that the record performance of united.com and other direct channels, which now account for 50% of tickets for United in 2019. I also wanted to note that Wi-Fi usage has grown by 45% in 2019, as we fixed many of the bandwidth problems. While the technology and bandwidth doesn\u2019t yet exist, we\u2019re getting ready for the day when domestic Wi-Fi will be free for our customers. Thanks to the entire United team for a great 2019.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gerry to discuss our financial results.","Gerald Laderman","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. And for those of you in Dublin for Aviation Week, good afternoon. Yesterday afternoon, we issued our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings release and our first quarter and full-year 2020 Investor Update. You can refer to those documents for additional detail.","For the highlights, Slide 14 is a summary of our GAAP financials and Slide 15 shows our non-GAAP adjusted results. We are pleased to report adjusted earnings per share of $12.05 for the full-year, up 32% versus 2018. For the year, adjusted pre-tax income was $4.1 billion and adjusted pre-tax margin was 9.4%, up 1.7 points year-over-year.","Our fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax margin was up 8.2%, was up 0.5%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted pre-tax margin expansion. As Oscar and Scott mentioned earlier, our resilience throughout the year helped us to offset challenges across the system and drive margin improvement.","Slide 16 shows our total unit cost growth for the fourth quarter and full-year 2019 and our forecast for the first quarter of 2020.","Turning to Slide 17. Non-fuel unit costs in the fourth quarter increased 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. This came in better than our original expectations around 3.5%, as our team work relentlessly to offset various cost pressures. This brought our full-year 2019 CASM ex to up 1%.","As I\u2019ve said before, the grounding of the MAX impacted CASM ex by at least 1%. So excluding this impact, unit cost in 2019 would have been flat or better year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect first quarter 2020 CASM ex to be up 1% to 2% year-over-year.","As you can see on Slide 18, during the quarter, we took delivery of a four new and to used mainline aircraft, as well as nine new regional aircrafts. We also announced in order to purchase 50 new Airbus A321 XLR aircraft, which we plan to take delivery of beginning in 2024.","The XLR will not only allow us to finish retiring our last remaining Boeing 757-200s by replacing them with aircraft that are approximately 30% more fuel efficient. But in addition, the XLRs range capabilities will also open potential new destinations to further develop our route network and provide customers with more options to travel the globe.","Also in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $216 million worth of shares of our common stock at an average price of $88.95 per share, bringing our share repurchases for the full-year to $1.6 billion. As of year-end 2019, we had $3.1 billion left in authorization and will continue to be opportunistic in our sharing purchase strategy.","Our adjusted capital expenditures for 2019 ended at $5 billion. This came in quietly above our guidance of $4.9 billion, as our Airbus order that we announced in December, drove some incremental pre-delivery payments. We currently anticipate spending approximately $7 billion in adjusted CapEx for 2020. We continue to expect this to be a peak CapEx year, driven largely by the acquisition of 17 wide-body aircraft this year.","In addition, as Greg and Andrew mentioned before, we\u2019re making a lot of high-return customer-centric investments that we will expect will not only improve customer experience, but will help us be a more profitable airline.","As we think about both CapEx and our share repurchase program, we are very cognizant of their impact on our fortress balance sheet that we have established and plan to maintain. The discipline we have shown as we continue to maintain strong liquidity, a large and growing pool of unencumbered assets and a very manageable schedule of debt repayments has been rewarded with tremendous access to attractive debt financing throughout our capital structure.","In addition, our success in managing the balance sheet and reducing financial risk continues to be recognized. Just last week, Moody\u2019s joined S&P in upgrading our credit ratings to positive outlook.","Lastly, Slide 19 has a summary of our current guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2020. As you can see, we will no longer be providing capacity guidance for the quarter or full-year or CASM ex guidance for the full-year. Our focus is our long-term earnings targets. And as we move forward, we will plan for capacity at levels that allow us to achieve those targets.","We currently expect full-year 2020 adjusted earnings per share to be between $11 and $13. While some may view this guidance to be little conservative, we are only three weeks into the new year and are still facing uncertainty in both the timing of the reintroduction of a MAX and speed at which our associated capacity will ramp up.","As always, we plan to update this target throughout the year, as we continue to execute on all of our initiatives and we absolutely aspire to end the year in a higher range, regardless of known and unknown headwinds that we as an industry routinely face.","The most recent examples of Boeing\u2019s announcement yesterday on the MAX and the uncertainty around the coronavirus in Asia. We will gain more clarity on these items in the weeks to come. And at our Investor Day in March, we will provide an update to our outlook. In addition at our Investor Day, we plan to once again provide multi-year EPS guidance.","With that, Mike, we\u2019ll now begin the Q&A.","Michael Leskinen","Thank you, Gerry. First, we\u2019ll take questions from analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And first off from Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning, everyone, and congrats on what was a \u2013 in hindsight, challenging year in 2019. So I guess, incrementally on the CapEx, because this is a pretty big year at $7 billion. And I think if we go back to your slides in 2018, it looks like maybe $5 billion to $6 billion was more of the expected range. So can you talk to some of the opportunities that you see there that you\u2019re willing to put capital behind this year? And maybe even go a little bit deeper on the non-aircraft side as well?","Gerald Laderman","So, as I said, the spike in CapEx was really attributable to those wide-body aircraft. 17 aircraft is \u2013 it\u2019s just a peak year for that. And really, when you\u2019re looking at our fleet plan, you kind of have to look at it over several year time horizon to \u2013 to take sort of more of the run rate number. So it\u2019s really nothing more than that for this year.","I would also point out that in that number, we are assuming the delivery of some MAX aircraft. And so we end up with no MAX aircraft, I would expect that number to come down a little bit.","On the non-aircraft side, I would say from what I\u2019m seeing right now, the number is a little bit higher this year than last year. But that is all attributable to really finishing the various reconfiguration projects that we have to get the Polaris modifications done and some of the other customer-centric modifications finished.","Brandon Oglenski","I appreciate that Gerry. And I guess a quick follow-up, Scott. As you take over here, what do you think is the right metric for investors to focus on? Is it something like free cash flow? Or should we be thinking that United still in this transformation mode there\u2019s a lot of opportunities out there so focus more on earnings revenue. What should we focus on?","Scott Kirby","Well, all of the metrics are highly correlated with earnings. And so I think the principal metric is probably earnings. Higher earnings drive higher free cash flow, higher earnings drive higher margins, higher earnings drive higher return on invested capital. And so I think we\u2019re kind of dancing on the head of a pin when we try to distinguish between those, because they\u2019re all so highly correlated. And because they\u2019re all highly correlated, I think, we\u2019ll focus more as we are in our guidance on earnings.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hey, good morning, everybody. Hey, Scott, sort of a philosophical question on pricing, not \u2013 certainly not a tactical one, now you\u2019ve been very clear over the years about the need to match the lowest fares in your market to win the long game. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s becoming outdated. I know you never get anchored in your opinion, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a point where we feel good enough about the quality of your service that you\u2019re providing to where sort of blanket price matching becomes not only unnecessary, but actually harmful to the brand, even in the long run?","Scott Kirby","So we are increasingly focused on improving the brand at United Airlines and the perception amongst customers. We\u2019re making significant investments in that. We\u2019ve talked about Backstage and Greg talked about a number of those investments. And it\u2019s increasingly clear that there is a large segment of customers who choose based on the quality of the product and the quality of the customer experience.","There are also customers out there who still choose their product based on price. And really what I would say is, what we\u2019ve done is try to create a segmentation, where we can offer both sets of customers, what they are looking for. And our basic economy product tends to be more focused on price as the rest of our products can be less focused on being price competitive.","Hunter Keay","Okay, thanks. And then what percentage of your credit card holders or premier status holders, either one has zip codes outside of your hub city catchment areas? Where was it before this recent growth spurt and where do you want it to be?","Andrew Nocella","Hunter, it\u2019s Andrew. I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t have the number off the top of my head. I think it\u2019s in the neighborhood of 50% from my memory.","Hunter Keay","Excuse me, 50%?","Andrew Nocella","50%, 5-0.","Hunter Keay","5-0, okay.","Andrew Nocella","Yes. And I think we\u2019d like to continue to diversify outside of our hubs. We\u2019re doing \u2013 but we\u2019ll have Kristina contact you to give you a few more details.","Hunter Keay","All right, guys. Thank you.","Operator","From Vertical Research, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Gerry, I realized that you don\u2019t want to provide an explicit 2020 CASM ex guide. But can you please help us understand some of what\u2019s changed since your October call when you guided 2020 CASM ex flat? For instance, what percentage of your 2020 capacity did the MAX represent back then? And then relative to that, what\u2019s the CASM ex hit associated with not having it for any period of time, however, you want to define it?","Gerald Laderman","Sure. Let me put it this way. We have not changed our commitment over the next several years that our goal remains flat CASM ex. And as I said in 2019, but to the MAX, we would have been at least flat and actually 2020, the same is generally true. And let me give you a little bit of color on the MAX. Looking at it today, we currently anticipate the MAX creates about 1 to 2 points of CASM ex pressure. So even if the MAX remains out for the full-year, taking the worst case, we expect that to be less than 2 points of CASM ex pressure. But let me remind you that none of this deviates from our commitment to deliver on our EPS target.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up on the non-op. What\u2019s driving the year-over-year decline in the first quarter? I assume pension is probably down a little bit, if \u2013 but if there\u2019s anything else, and then also, do you see that carrying through the year?","Gerald Laderman","So that\u2019s generally, actually, some changes we made in some of our post-employment benefits, some of our post-retirement medical plans, where we\u2019re able to save some money without changing the benefits at all. That\u2019s really the principal driver there.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning, everybody. First one probably for Gerry. As it relates to the $11 to $13 guide for this year, I\u2019m hoping you could talk a bit more about how that might have evolved? There was a time when it was suggested that it could move higher.","Clearly, conditions evolved in a way that prevented that from happening, and I don\u2019t think this came as a surprise. I\u2019m not being critical of this fact. I\u2019m just curious as to how your model for 2020 evolved over, say, the last four to five months. What the various puts and takes were whether $12 to $14 was ever pondered.","Gerald Laderman","So, Jamie, let me tell you. From my perspective, it could have been $10 to $14. Yes, just looking at the first two weeks of January, and I look at the spot price for jet fuel every day and the impact it has on the forward curve for the rest of the year. And if you look at it, so you would have seen a lot of volatility.","So, given that, given some of the other unknowns out there and some of the knowns that we just don\u2019t know yet how they\u2019re going to impact us, as I mentioned earlier, and my general nature of being a little conservative that\u2019s where we came out. And as I mentioned, we absolutely aspire to raise the range over the course of the year, but we\u2019ll have to see what happens over the course of the next few months.","Jamie Baker","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. And second, just related to the MAX, I believe you have one SIM in Denver. Could you tell us what the SIM order book looks like, something I\u2019ve never asked before? And more importantly, as Boeing inevitably has to shift around the skyline, what would your interest be in rescheduling deliveries, given the presumed desperation of other global operators, and whether there\u2019s an opportunity to monetize simulator access?","Gregory Hart","Hey, Jamie, this is Greg.","Jamie Baker","Hi, Greg.","Gregory Hart","How are you? Hey, we\u2019ve got currently one fix training device, MAX fix training device up and running. We\u2019ll have a full motion SIM up and running in the next, I want to say, six to eight weeks, and over the coming months, we\u2019ll take delivery of two more SIMs. So we actually feel really comfortable in terms of where we are relative to simulator capability. Obviously, we assumed a quicker delivery stream from Boeing than what we\u2019ve seen and we\u2019re more than amply prepared for whatever might come in terms of delivery stream.","Jamie Baker","Opportunity to monetize that access for that capacity?","Gregory Hart","Yes, Jamie, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve done here at United in the past. We actually haven\u2019t thought about it too much. We\u2019ve been focused on our plans, internal plans to make sure sure that we could meet whatever delivery stream we have on the aircraft. It\u2019s obviously something that we\u2019ll think about. But I would expect to have too much third-party activity in our SIM Boeings.","Jamie Baker","Excellent. I appreciate it. And on a personal note, welcome back from Guam.","Gregory Hart","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Gerry, just had kind of a follow-up on the unit cost, and I know you\u2019re not giving a full-year outlook. But the 1Q guide of 1% to 2% was better than what we were thinking better than the back-half of 2019 and up 2.5%. Just trying to get a sense for is this 1% to 2%, or could quarterly run rate, while the MAX is out? Or was there some timing we could \u2013 we should consider here? I guess, basically, any color you can provide about the cost cadence throughout the year would be helpful. Thanks.","Gerald Laderman","Sure. As you identified, there\u2019s always timing when you\u2019re looking at quarterly CASM numbers. Last year, you may remember, there were some maintenance events weighted more heavily towards the back-end of the year. So the first-half of the year, CASM ex was better than the back-half. We always take that into account when we look at the full- year and look at our commitment to deliver. But for the MAX, flat or better CASM ex.","Andrew Didora","Is that the way we should think about kind of the out years once the MAX is back is sort of flat to down CASM? Is that what the plan is right now without stealing any thunder for \u2013 from March?","Gerald Laderman","It\u2019s been our commitment. We\u2019ve been public for several years on that. That\u2019s our commitment. Keep in mind, one of the tailwinds we\u2019re going to have, which has now been delayed a little bit is on gauge. If you look at our \u2013 what would have been our MAX delivery schedule, you would have seen the MAX 10 coming in and those aircraft, in addition to growth replacing smaller gauge aircraft. So that\u2019s still a terrific head \u2013 tailwind that we have over the next few years.","Andrew Didora","All right. Thanks, Gerry. I appreciate it.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we have Catherine O\u2019Brien. Please go ahead.","Catherine O\u2019Brien","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. So a question just, I think this year, your performance is commendable despite the headwinds of the MAX, and I really appreciate your note ceases mentality. But can you help us think about the negative impact to the MAX thus far? Just trying to get a handle on what the core business could have produced without that headwind? Should we think about any impact above and beyond that CASM ex headwind you alluded to earlier?","Gerald Laderman","Well, keep in mind, the \u2013 have we had the MAX, we would have benefited both on the CASM side and on the revenue side as well. But we as the other carriers who did not have the MAX, lost income as a result.","Catherine O\u2019Brien","Right. So I guess it\u2019s maybe like any color on like maybe like a margin detrimental or EPS you\u2019re willing to share?","Gerald Laderman","Look, I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve been careful to not use any of the events that have happened as excuses. We delivered on getting a year early to our $11 to $13 EPS goal, and we\u2019re not going to start now using them as excuses. So we\u2019ll keep our conversations private with Boeing on what we think the impact was and just leave it at that.","Catherine O\u2019Brien","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just ask one quick follow-up. So you\u2019ve always had a really strong international network and, of course, you\u2019ve been focused on strengthening part to your domestic over the last couple of years. But United still has the highest percentage of passenger revenue booked on its international network. Do you think that\u2019s the right mix, or do you think we\u2019re going to see that change, as it continue to strengthen your domestic network? Thanks.","Andrew Nocella","It\u2019s Andrew speaking. It\u2019s a really good question. And obviously, these things cycle over time. There\u2019s definitely a long period of time where international margins are greater than domestic. Clearly, over the last few years domestic margins have been greater. And we\u2019ve been pivoting here at United to fix our Mid-Continental gaps that we talk about regularly and we still think that is a priority.","Unfortunately, the MAX delay has delayed our ability to properly fix the connectivity in our Mid-Continental hubs. And so we\u2019re going to be focused on that as we go forward for the next few years. But underlying all of that is really, I think, the best global network of any airline, two from the United States and we\u2019re really proud of that and we think it has a lot of opportunities.","We do think these things cycle and we\u2019ll be ready when the international environment is even better, and we did see strong momentum late last year, where that environment is better and international profit margins, in fact, are higher. And I think that\u2019s going to come some day in the future. But right now focused on domestic, but we have a lot of strength and we have a lot of optionality in our international network.","Catherine O\u2019Brien","Great. Thank you.","Operator","From Evercore, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. On co-brand expansion potential, certainly not going to ask you about timing. But at points in time, United talked about kind of a gap to where market rates were and those were kind of agreements you were close to. Some of that commentary was before Delta\u2019s expansion with AmEx. And so my question is, in your opinion, did Delta reset the bar for the market or just catch up to where the market already was?","Gerald Laderman","Obviously, Delta\u2019s advertise their new deal with AmEx a lot and we see it. We\u2019re in close contact with our partner, Chase, and we continue to work with them on making sure that our program card is the biggest and best it can be. It\u2019s been growing a lot over the last few years. In fact, we\u2019re about to launch a new business card, which we\u2019re really proud of.","So there\u2019s a lot more to come in this space, I think is what I would tell you today, exactly where the market is, where we are and where others are. I think it\u2019s really a little bit difficult to tell sometimes based on what is reported and what\u2019s not reported. But we will continue to make sure that the United co-brand is the best it can be.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks. And then just for a follow-up, the premium seating expansion clearly came across in the presentation you\u2019re talking about making it easier to upsell premium Economy. I wonder if you could quantify how many points of RASM that potentially represents when you\u2019re ramped? Thanks for taking the questions.","Gerald Laderman","Sure. I \u2013 well, actually, I think, talk about that more at Investor Day coming up. But we have definitely tilted our capacity as we enter 2020. We expect premium products to be a bigger proportion of our revenue pie for the year and we expect that to have a really meaningful impact on RASM. But we\u2019ll save all those details for a few weeks from now.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you","Operator","From UBS, we have Myles Walton. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. Andrew, you talked about the ancillary growth about 12% and I think you tied it to the greater point-of-sale at united.com and direct channels, reaching 50%. I\u2019m curious, can you give some maybe meat around the argument of what the conversion rate looks like for the ancillary, when they\u2019re on the direct channels? And also how high you think that direct channel can get you over the next couple of years?","Gerald Laderman","It\u2019s a big \u2013 it\u2019s a hard number to move. So, getting from 50 to 60 is not something that\u2019s going to happen overnight. But we would like to see united.com and our direct channels move towards the mid-50s over the next few years. It\u2019s a big goal. We\u2019ll see if we can get there.","That being said, there\u2019s no doubt we\u2019re motivated to move in that direction, because the conversion rates on united.com for ancillary revenues are simply dramatically higher. We won\u2019t give the exact numbers, but they are higher. So we are continuing to work to make that number higher in united.com by changing how we display and show things and the products we offer. And we\u2019re also working with our partners that are third-party distributors to see how we can make those numbers get better as well.","So I think there\u2019s a lot more upside, but I talked about earlier was the fact that Economy Plus was being put on the shelf on united.com. In the past, I didn\u2019t think we properly displayed that. And with this new beta tests we have going on and properly displaying United \u2013 the Economy Plus seat, we think that could have a meaningful impact on Economy Plus seat sales going forward. We have to get our products on the shelf for them to sell properly.","Myles Walton","And just one clarification, I think in response to the previous question, you talked about the Dash 10 being pushed out further and that was part of the upgauging our seat growth per departure. I I think you had given a previous metric about 3% growth in seat per departure. Is that still valid for 2020?","Gerald Laderman","I want to get that number. Simply not valid in Q1.","Myles Walton","Yes.","Gerald Laderman","That is a negative number on gauge in Q1, which we\u2019re disappointed by, but somebody can get you the annual number. I think it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s no longer valid, unfortunately.","Myles Walton","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thank you very much, operator. Hi, team, and thank you very much for taking my question. Scott, when you look at the \u2013 or actually anybody can answer this who knows the answer. When you look at what you had talked about a couple of years ago about replacing smaller aircraft with larger aircraft in key markets. Can you just update us on where that stands now? Like, is that program completely done? And so all the capacity growth that you\u2019re doing in 2020 is going to be in new markets and in connecting the dots?","Oscar Munoz","Well, I\u2019ll let Andrew add to that. I\u2019ll let Andrew add to it, but it\u2019s nowhere close to done and it was a big setback. The MAX has been a big setback. There are a number of markets that would have been upgauged last year that would be being upgauged this year. We began upgauge the following year that are behind because of the MAX play.","Andrew Nocella","Yes. I think that\u2019s absolutely correct. Yes, we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re not where we hoped we\u2019d be at this point. We have a lot more gauge to come going forward, as Gerry also hinted at, but the \u2013 maybe the other way to look at it is our scheduled depth. We\u2019re just not where we need to be on competitive schedule depth and we\u2019re trying to correct that and we\u2019re also trying to engage in the right direction. And the MAX delay is kind of boarded our progress on that front, at least for 2019, and looks like for a big chunk of 2020 at this point.","Helane Becker","Okay, thank you. I appreciate the time.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Savanthi Syth. Please go ahead.","Savanthi Syth","Hey, good morning. Andrew, if I might just ask a little bit of a follow-up on the kind of regional entity trends that you were talking about. Could you give a little bit more color on generally, what you\u2019re seeing today on this \u2013 on that front? I know you mentioned Hong Kong will stop being a pressure and Germany is maybe kind of bottoming or rebounding. So is it fair to assume that those entities, we should see a sequential improvement, just any additional color would be helpful?","Andrew Nocella","All right. I think, for the quarter, at a macro level, the entities I expect to come in and basically the same rank order. So I expect that the Latin American division will be our best, I think domestic second, and then Europe third, and Asia last again.","In terms of a little bit more color, we\u2019re just watching the situation in China, Beijing and Shanghai and also Hong Kong very carefully. We do think that Hong Kong, based on current trends is no longer a drag on PRASM, which was nice to see. I do expect that Beijing and Shanghai will still be a slight drag on PRASM. But what I can tell you is that demand over the last eight weeks to Beijing and Shanghai has actually increased.","So from a revenue perspective, for the last 12 months, our ticketed revenues to Beijing and Shanghai have been down 4%. But over the last eight weeks, they\u2019ve been up 3%. So I do think we\u2019ve turned the corner there absent any other significant situations that arise in China, particularly Beijing and Shanghai. So good progress there.","We\u2019re watching Australia very carefully. The wildfires have really had some impact on demand. So we\u2019ll keep a close eye on that. But all the rest of Asia, Japan looks very good and Taiwan as well. South America, I think is kind of leading the charge, as well as Mexico and Central America. So that all looks, I think very good. And in Europe, we\u2019ve been deploying our new 767 high-J to London Heathrow. I think that\u2019s having a nice tailwind on the system that has offset some of the Germany weakness. But in the case of Germany, we did see demand from our key corporate clients and travel agency sales go positive over the last few weeks, which is really nice to see after pretty much 12 months of negative numbers.","So we\u2019re optimistic that Germany is on the mend and moving in the right direction, at least at this point, which has lots to do with industrial. So overall across the globe, there are definitely a few spots, but we generally see encouraging trends.","Operator","And from Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Gerry, can you just provide a little bit more color around the step down and CapEx you\u2019re expecting in 2021? If you look at the last 10-Q from October, it shows about a $2.5 billion decline in aircraft purchase commitments year-over-year, but that was I guess before the Airbus order you referenced. So can you just maybe update us on what that looks like now in 2021 verses 2020? Thank you.","Gerald Laderman","It\u2019s a little early to be able to give you a good number largely, because until Boeing tells us what the MAX delivery schedule is going to look like. It\u2019s just tough. Next year would have been a year of significant MAX deliveries. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen yet on those. It\u2019s a little premature. We also don\u2019t know how many of the MAXs that we assumed for this year might get pushed.","I mean, all we know today is that there were 16 aircraft built. They\u2019re sitting up in Boeing facilities. We\u2019d like to get those when aircraft start delivering. But particularly with Boeing having shutdown the line, they need to tell us and to other customers, how they\u2019re going to allocate slots to everybody, and that will drive a lot of the 2021 CapEx number. So it\u2019s just too soon to tell.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. So Gerry, is the step down a function of \u2013 is it hundreds of millions or is it billions?","Gerald Laderman","Again, it\u2019s just too soon to tell on that.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay.","Gerald Laderman","I don\u2019t expect it to be billions plural, but it\u2019s really too soon to tell.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Maybe just a question for Scott or Andrew try and stump Scott. What percent of the tickets sold in 2019 were on fares, which were in the market in order to match a competitor\u2019s fares versus what percent of tickets sold were that\u2019s what Jim and I said was the right fare? Thank you.","Scott Kirby","I\u2019m not sure I understand the question, but\u2026","Joseph DeNardi","Try to understand, Scott, how much of your revenue is subject to kind of the worst competitor in the market? How often do you have to just match theirs versus how often can you go with what you think is the best fare at that point?","Scott Kirby","Well, typically, all of our fares are matching something. There\u2019ll be multiple fares in the market. I guess your question is, how often are we selling the lowest fare in the market is really the right way to ask the question. And I don\u2019t know the percentage at the time, I would guess. It\u2019s a single-digit percent of our seats were sold at the lowest fare available in the market.","Gerald Laderman","Yes. I would \u2013 I agree with that. I mean, Jim and I gives us the guidance in terms of what the demand forecast is to open up or close down. And so \u2013 and that said, by market, by day, by everything. So, I\u2019m not sure how else is that.","Scott Kirby","But I think what you\u2019re really getting at is like the lowest fare in the market is probably selling \u2013 we\u2019re quite selling single-digit percent of our seat at the absolute lowest fare in the market.","Operator","And from Bernstein, we have David Vernon. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Hey, guys, thanks for your time. Andrew, just to start out on the premium product or the Premium Plus roll out, the tailwind you guys cited kind of grew from 50 to 60 bps from 3 to 4Q. Just trying to get a sense for what the tailwind should be in 2020 as you ladder in, I think, a broader roll out of that product. Should that benefit sort of increase as we get through the year assuming stable conditions, not looking really for guidance, just trying to make sure I understand how that roll out is going to affect the base business?","Andrew Nocella","Yes. what I would say is there\u2019s \u2013 the roll out will continue and we\u2019re gaining critical mass, and therefore, I\u2019m optimistic we\u2019ll see that number inch up even a little bit more as we head into Q1 and Q2 and maybe in Q3, particularly when all the 777s have the product. Then we start to lap as we really get into the later parts of Q3 and Q4. And there\u2019s a little bit different than that. I think our expertise and how we manage product will be a big driver in it, whether it can expand or not beyond that number.","And so, I hesitate to say that, as we enter fourth quarter of 2020, that we can keep it at that same pace. But we\u2019re optimistic that there\u2019s still a lot out there as we learn how to better manage it from day-to-day and flight-to-flight.","David Vernon","And that should expand even a little bit more to 2021. So I think you said, we\u2019re going to get to 8% of ASMs by 2021, right?","Scott Kirby","Yes. The maturity of the product really, by early 2021 we have it on all the airplanes we\u2019re going to have it on. In fact, I think at this point, we plan to have it on every one of our intercontinental wide bodies with the exception of 14 767-300s, but every other aircraft is going to have it and it\u2019s going to be very, very consistent.","So we\u2019re excited to get out there, and we think \u2013 we do think it provides a continued tailwind whether it\u2019s a half a point or so or 60 points- the 60 basis points. That seems aggressive as you get that far out. But it is a continuing tailwind, along with the other actions that were taken on this front, where there\u2019s more first-class seats on our 319, the high-J 767s that were flying to London Heathrow and Switzerland. So there\u2019s a lot of initiatives on this front that continue to roll out that we expect provide a tailwind that\u2019s unique to United for the next year or two, at least.","Operator","And from Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead. Dan McKenzie, your line is open.","Daniel McKenzie","Oh, yep. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Andrew, given the news this weekend, I\u2019m wondering if you can help us think about the revenue shock absorbers. So first, does the preliminary revenue outlook embed some volatility in the demand data? And then setting aside the news from this weekend, I\u2019m wondering what corporate clients are telling you about their international travel needs in a post trade deal world. Is the thought that there could be some acceleration in international demand to come that we just can\u2019t see today?","Andrew Nocella","I think that\u2019s the case. We actually \u2013 and just in the last few weeks have seen Beijing and Shanghai demand increased relative to where we were for most of last year. So I don\u2019t have an official readout from corporate clients on that part. But I will say, as we look at corporate demand for last year, I think it was really healthy. But when you look at it, divided by the different divisions around the globe, what you find is our Asia Pacific corporate demand was, in fact, negative, where the rest of the world was positive.","So it just provides an easier comp. So I\u2019m optimistic that absent the issue that we had this last few days that we\u2019re going to see stronger results, particularly in the Asia Pacific region as relates to that.","In regards to \u2013 the \u2013 really, I think forecast and as we look at each quarter and we assess where we think things will turn out, we clearly have a tendency to put a little bit of, like to say, wiggle room, in the numbers for unknown things that will happen, because it\u2019s been pretty predictable that there\u2019ll be something unknown that will happen in any part of the globe.","And so we do believe room for that. And I think that you can see that over our track record of the last two years plus on the RASM, guys, whether we left exactly enough room, only time will tell. But we do feel comfortable with current trends and the room we\u2019ve left in. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see how things unfold over the next week or so to really be able to firmly answer at least how that relates to what\u2019s happening in China today at this point.","Daniel McKenzie","That\u2019s perfect. Thanks so much for the time you guys.","Operator","And from Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Oh. Hey, thanks, everyone. Hey, two quick ones here. Gerry, Gerry, on just the $7 billion of CapEx, what\u2019s the rough split aircraft versus non-aircraft?","Gerald Laderman","It is roughly, call it, $5 billion aircraft, roughly $2 billion non-aircraft.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. And then just a question to Andrew. Andrew, I had heard somewhere that you were considering adding more seats to your 787, 8s and 9s. Is that true? And what happens to your premium seating in the \u2013 on those airplanes if that does go through? Does it \u2013 is it coming down, or is it just a different configuration? Thanks.","Andrew Nocella","Sure. So the 789 is the heart of our 787 fleet. We have the most of those aircraft. And the seating configuration on that aircraft as it relates to business classes, I think remains identical. That\u2019s not the case, somebody will get back to you, but we didn\u2019t change the number of business class seats on the 789 as it goes through its reconfiguration over the next 12 months or so.","So we\u2019re fine there. We did find a little bit of room in the coach cabin. So the density, the number of seats on aircraft did go up a little bit. So the aircraft has more seats in total, but we didn\u2019t lose any J seats on that.","Michael Linenberg","Okay.","Andrew Nocella","Like I said, on the 788, we did reduce the size of the J-Class cabin. I don\u2019t know the number off the top of my head. I think it\u2019s 28 to 30 seats relative to where we are today, which I think is 36 seats. We did that, because the missions that we\u2019re going to be using the 788 on are likely to be more leisure-oriented that have lower business class demand.","We have literally 150-plus wide bodies with very large J-Class cabins, in fact, some cabins getting bigger on all the other aircraft types. On this particular aircraft type, which really have 12 units.","We did reduce the size of the cabin to reflect how we will use the aircraft in the future, which has a more leisure-oriented tilt than business tilt, and we thought that was the right segmentation of seats onboard that aircraft, given how it\u2019ll be used. But again, it\u2019s 12 aircraft that have a fleet of almost 200 wide-body aircraft. It doesn\u2019t move the numbers.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] And from Bloomberg, we have Justin Bachman. Please go ahead.","Justin Bachman","Yes. Hi, thanks for the time today. This question, I think, is for Oscar or Scott. I wanted to ask about your decision to get rid of the capacity guidance and what sort of growth United will see over the next year or two or three in terms of both the Mid-Continent and if that\u2019s just a function of the MAX uncertainty, or if you\u2019re now at a period where you\u2019re slowing things down, because you feel that you\u2019ve regained that share that United did not have in the past? Thanks.","Scott Kirby","So we have decided \u2013 well, we want to focus our efforts and our guidance on earnings. That\u2019s the key metric that we\u2019re trying to focus on. And if that means we should grow 5% to hit our earnings growth targets, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. It mean we should grow 1% to get our earnings growth targets then what we\u2019ll do.","We\u2019re really focused on earnings. And so we always actually intended as we\u2019ve built increasing credibility with hitting our numbers to stop giving full-year capacity guidance beginning next year. But given we have one competitor already do it and given the uncertainty that we have with the MAX we did a year early. But really, the only thing that are changing guidance had to do with the MAX, because we did it a year early, because we have a lot of uncertainty this year. But we always intended to do it and it\u2019s really a focus on driving towards our earnings target and having all of us focused on earnings metrics as the right metric.","Justin Bachman","Great, thanks. But as far as your comfort with the Mid-Continent strategy, where does that resume? Andrew had talked about sort of a halt, given the MAX. Is that coming back when you get the MAX?","Andrew Nocella","I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a halt. This is Andrew. What I would say is, we\u2019re just not where we otherwise would like to be because of lack of the MAX. So we have built connectivity. We focused, in fact, in Denver. So that the Denver growth actually does continue. We have \u2013 we\u2019re not where we\u2019d like to be in Houston or Chicago. So only time will tell.","And the other thing I\u2019ll add is the CRJ 550, which has been a \u2013 I think a smashing success so far is doing really well and that does also help our Mid-Continent activity. But the MAX aircraft or a key ingredient to what we\u2019re trying to accomplish and they\u2019re not available to fly and therefore, we\u2019re behind schedule on where we\u2019d otherwise like to be. And we\u2019re likely to be behind schedule for the foreseeable future, given the latest announcement from Boeing.","Justin Bachman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And from Wall Street Journal, we have Alison Sider. Please go ahead.","Alison Sider","Hi, thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how likely simulator training requirements could affect sort of the pace and the cadence of return to service eventually. What kind of competitions might that introduce? And how long do you think it\u2019ll take, any color you have would be great?","Gregory Hart","Thanks. Thanks for the question. This is Greg. We don\u2019t anticipate any issues if simulator training is required by the FAA. We, as we talked about earlier, we have ample simulator capacity and we\u2019re working on plans to allow us to divide by whatever guidance the FAA issues.","Alison Sider","Got it. Thanks. And if I could just follow-up. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if there is any kind of thinking of like a worst-case scenario, if the MAX doesn\u2019t fly again. Is there sort of a contingency plan for that, like in the back room somewhere, or is that even something you consider a possibility if you would just have to give up on the MAX or how might that play out?","Oscar Munoz","We continue to assume there\u2019ll be a safe return of the MAX. And we\u2019re actually encouraged at what we hope is more \u2013 a more realistic timeline and target and we will be announcing soon our own pushback of service that gives us time from what Boeing is now saying about the MAX return to service to give us time to get the airplane back up and running, including time for classroom training and simulator training for our pilots before they fly.","Andrew Nocella","At this point, we\u2019re assessing the impact of the schedule.

Our earnings release and separate investor update were issued this morning and are available on our website at ir.unitedcontinentalholdings.com.","Let me point out that information in this morning's earnings press release and investor update and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. ","A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings, United Airlines and Continental Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also during the course of the call we\u2019ll be discussing several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the table at the end of the earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website.","Our full year 2011 results are presented on a combined basis for United Continental Holdings. Full year 2011 results discussed today, including comparisons against prior year will be based on unaudited pro forma financial results for the combined company and include estimates of the impact of purchase accounting.

These items are detailed in our earnings release.","In the fourth quarter we reclassified revenue associated with our non-air mileage redemption through our MileagePlus loyalty program from passenger revenue to other revenue in 2010 and 2011 and these results have been adjusted to reflect the change. For additional information, please refer to our investor update issued today.","And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeffery Smisek, President and CEO of United.","Jeffery Smisek","Thanks Nene and Tyler and good morning and thank you all for joining us for our 2011 full year earnings call. Today we reported net income of $1.3 billion for the full year or $3.49 per diluted share, delivering a 3.6% pre-tax margin. For the quarter we earned $109 million of profit or $0.30 per diluted share. ","2011, our first full year as a merged airline was a year on many successes for the new United. We received our single operating certificate, made good progress with our labor groups, delivered record passenger revenue, exceeded our goal of achieving 25% of our merger synergies for the year and generated returns in excess of our cost of capital. ","My co-workers worked together all year to run a clean, safe and reliable airline, while integrating our two subsidiaries. I am proud of the progress we made in 2011 and I thank my co-workers for all they did for the new United this past year. All their hard work paid off as we accrued $265 million of profit sharing for 2011. That represents about 5% of the eligible compensation of each participant in the program. My management team and I look forward to distributing profit sharing cheques to co-workers on Valentines Day, February 14, as we share in the profit that we all helped to create. ","I\u2019ve been clear that we\u2019re working hard to turn the new United into a real business; that is a business that sustainably generates returns in excess of it\u2019s cost to capital. Sufficient and sustainable profitability will permit us to build the airline our co-workers want to work for, our customers want to fly and our investors want to invest in. ","There is no doubt that 2011 was a challenging year for the U.S. and global economies, marked by a high end employment, slow GDP growth in the U.S. and across much of the globe, high and volatile jet fuel prices, the debt crises in Europe and the adverse impact of the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. ","Our ability to generate $1.3 billion of pre-tax earnings in this adverse environment is a testament to our financial and operational flexibility and company wide focus on sustained and sufficient profitability. While we made significant progress integrating the operations of our two subsidiaries in 2011, 2012 is the year that we will become one airline for our customers. We will have one brand, one website, one loyalty program and one name. ","As I\u2019ve discussed with you before, the key to our becoming one airline for our customers is our conversion to a single passenger service system, which is known as shares and is the system currently used by our continental subsidiary. Our information technology, reservations and the airport services teams have developed and thoroughly tested our conversion. ","The shares platform is already integrated with continental.com, which will be re-branded as united.com and will be our combined website. We have devoted significant training, staffing and technology resources to ensure the success of our conversion to shares, which will take place in early March. ","After this conversion, all agents will be able to serve all our customers. We will be able to freely flow all our aircraft across our network and park at all our gates. We will have a single reservation system managing all our bookings and on our website and by phone and we\u2019ll have a single loyalty program and our lead levels for all our customers. The flexibility and functionality of shares are key to achieving our goal of delivering 75% of our annual expected merger synergies in 2012. ","Once we\u2019ve completed the conversion of shares, we will re-launch united.com, which will provide us with the right platform for innovation as we continue to develop new travel options and products that our customers will value and that will contribute to our bottom line. We will also launch our combined loyalty program MileagePlus.","We are making significant investments in our onboard product, airport experience and our industry leading loyalty program and I\u2019m excited by what we have in store for our customers this year.","We began installing Economy Plus on our Continental fleet in December and will complete our entire Boeing 757 fleet by early February. By the end of 2012 we expect to have our entire mainline fleet outfitted with Economy Plus. We continue to install our lie-flat seats on our international aircraft and we expect to have virtually all of our international aircraft reconfigured by the end of this year. ","We will be the first U.S. airline to offer global in-flight connectivity when we begin our satellite based WiFi installation program in the second half of 2012. We will also begin a complete nose to tail overhaul of the interiors of our popular PS Trans-Con fleet later this year for flights between FJK and San Francisco in Los Angelus and when we\u2019re done, we will have the best Trans-Con product in the industry.","We continue to invest in a fuel-efficient fleet and expect to bring five Boeing 787 Dreamliners into service in the second half of the year. The Dreamliners will be a game changing aircraft and we eagerly anticipate its induction into our fleet. In addition to the Dreamliners, we expect to take delivery of 19 Boeing 737-900ER\u2019s with the Boeing Sky Interior this year.","We are also focused on enhancing the customer experience at our airports. Just this past Monday we broke ground on the first phase of our billion-dollar investment in Terminal B at Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. In Chicago, we are installing additional jet bridges for our United Express Operation in O\u2019Hare\u2019s Terminal 2. We are refreshing the interiors of many of our United Clubs around the system and we are building a new club in Terminal 2 at O\u2019Hare. ","Since we merged a little over a year ago, we\u2019ve already co-located operations at 66 airports and have common gate areas at more than 290 airports, making connections and airport navigation easier for almost 80% of all customers flying on our network.","MileagePlus is the worlds leading loyalty program and we intend to keep it that way. We continue rolling out new ways for our customers to earn and redeem miles by expanding the number of business partners that participate in the MileagePlus loyalty network. The 2012 MileagePlus program launches in early March and features a new five tier elite program that recognizes and rewards our most valuable customers. We are expanding our customer service resources and the geographic footprint for our renowned global services program, our top elite tier. ","We are also continuing to integrate our workgroups that have made significant progress to better align the pay benefits and work rules for several of our work groups, on the path to negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements. Our United technicians represented by the teamsters recently ratified a new contract that better aligned their compensation and work rules with that of their continental co-workers and we will soon begin the process of negotiating a joint collective bargaining agreement. ","We recently reached a tentative agreement with the association of flight attendants for a new contract for our United flight attendants. The contract is currently up for ratification and when that\u2019s done, we\u2019ll begin the process of negotiating a joint agreement for our flight attendants. ","We began negotiations for a joint agreement with our ramp co-workers and our customer service airport and reservation agent co-workers are currently in an election process to determine whether or not they wish to be represented by a union. Our engineers recently rejected union representation in favor of a direct relationship with the company. ","We continue to have productive discussions with our pilots. The United Master Executive Council of the airline pilots association recently elected a new leader and we believe that he has a significant opportunity to engage constructively with the company and make progress on delivering a joint collective bargaining agreement that is fair to the pilots and fair to the company. ","We are making significant strides towards becoming the worlds leading airline, but none of it would be possible without generating sufficient profitability. Returns in excess of our cost of capital allow us to invest in our product, our people, our fleet, our facilities and our technology and ultimately provide rewards to all of our stakeholders. We have much more work to do, but we are clearly on the right path.","Before I turn it over to Jim and Zane to walk you through the numbers, I would like to extend my thanks to our customers around the globe for their ongoing loyalty and for supporting us as we work towards completing our integration. We are working very hard to continue to earn your business. Jim?","Jim Compton","Thanks Jeff. I join Jeff in thanking our co-workers for their hard work this quarter and year and our customers for choosing to fly United. ","United\u2019s fourth quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue increased 8.2% and mainline PRASM improved 7.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. Yield improvements again drove our revenue gains this quarter. For the full year United\u2019s consolidated unit passenger revenue increased 9.2% versus 2010, leading the US network carriers during a challenging economic backdrop. ","Consolidated yield for the full year increased 10.6% year-over-year. Capacity discipline, fare management and the United\u2019s outstanding route network drove the year-over-year yield in revenue growth. ","Throughout 2011 we demonstrated our commitment to matching capacity to demand across the network. Our fourth quarter consolidated capacity decreased by 2.5% from the same period in 2010. Domestic mainline capacity decreased nearly 5% and Trans-Atlantic capacity declined 2% in the quarter as compared to last year. For the full year the company reduced consolidated capacity by 0.2% and mainline capacity by 0.3% year-over-year. ","Fourth quarter domestic mainline PRASM increased 10.3% on a year-over-year yield increase of 9.8% and a capacity decrease of about 5%. For the full year domestic mainline PRASM increased 10.9% and a 10.6% increase in yields and a 2.8% decline in capacity versus 2010. This is an excellent full year result for the domestic mainline entity. Fares throughout the year remain higher due to successful fare increases, industry wide capacity discipline and early network optimization from our merger.","Regional PRASM grew by 11.3% in the fourth quarter and 9.4% in 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010. International unit revenue increased 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 7.9% for the full year versus 2010. Fourth quarter and full year international yields improved 6.8% and 10.9% respectively. International capacity declined 0.3% in the quarter.","Latin America again was United\u2019s best performing entity this quarter and holds our top spot for the full year as well. Latin America PRASM drew 11.7% in the fourth quarter and 17.6% for the full year. Yields grew by more than 11% in the quarter and 19.5% for the full year. South America continued to significantly improve on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter with premium and economy PRASM up 17% and 15.5% respectively.","Trans-Atlantic PRASM increased 3.7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter with yields up 6.5%. For the full year Trans-Atlantic unit revenue grew 5.1% and yield increased by 8.7%. Premium cabin demand to continental Europe and the UK was strong in the fourth quarter, with yields in PRASM up year-over-year. Middle East PRASM increased 5.3% and yields grew 6.4% with double-digit gains in the premium cabin. ","Our Pacific network generated PRASM growth of 6.4% for the full year, with fourth quarter PRASM up 1.1%. Yields grew 9.3% during 2011 versus 2010 and 4.5% for the fourth quarter. Our pacific presence is unmatched in the industry and it remains one of our most profitable entities. China PRASM end yield in the economy cabin decreased during the quarter, but were partially offset by higher fares yield in PRASM in the premium cabin. ","Corporate revenue continued to show steady improvement in the fourth quarter. Corporate yields grew 9% versus the fourth quarter 2010 and revenue improved 13%. For the full year our corporate revenue increased more than 14% with double digit yield growth and corporate fares up 9%. ","Business today is more global than ever and we continue to develop the United network and product portfolio to be a single solution for the corporate traveler. Our corporate customer portfolio is comprised of a diverse group of industries and this diversity provides United a unique hedge against demand volatility in any one sector. ","We have ongoing conversations with our corporate customers to best understand their near term travel needs and longer term outlook. Based on our most recent discussions, the majority of our global corporate accounts expect 2012 travel volumes to be flat to up and travel spend to moderately increase versus 2011, with first quarter trends expected to mimic the full year.","Fourth quarter cargo revenue declined 8.1% versus the same period last year. We continue to feel the adverse impact of increased industry cargo capacity, particularly across the pacific. Cargo yields increased 5%, while cargo volumes decreased about 12% year-over-year. ","During 2011 we generated approximately $250 million of revenue synergies, beating our expectation. We expect to generate significantly more revenue synergies in 2012, enabled largely by our conversion to a single passenger service system. ","During 2011 we reduced capacity to right size our supply for the expected demand. In light of our latest demand projections and U.S. and global economic growth expectations for the year, we continue to believe that we should hold our capacity flat with a downward bias for 2012. We expect our first quarter 2012 consolidated capacity to be down slightly year-over-year. As a reminder 2012 is a leap year and as a result we expect to see capacity growth in February, which adds more than a point of capacity for the first quarter.","We look forward to converting to a single passenger service system in early March, which will allow us to optimize our combined network and match the right aircraft with the right markets. While we have already done some modest optimization on a limited basis as opportunities arise, we plan to make more material schedule changes as we move through the year. ","A single passenger service system is not just about the schedule; however, it also provides us the opportunity to introduce new ancillary products. Ancillary revenue this quarter grew by 5% year-over-year and for the full year we generated more than $2 billion in ancillary revenue. ","Our existing portfolio with ancillary products and services, led by our Economy Plus seating is well received by our customers. Once we convert to shares, we will harmonize our ancillary product portfolio and begin to roll out new products for the new United. ","That said, core passenger demand remained stable and solid and based on our latest forecast we estimate United\u2019s January consolidated PRASM will increase approximately 11% year-over-year. Domestic yields continue to show strong improvement year-over-year and we have seen numerous fare actions recently to further improve the yield environment. This PRASM estimate is preliminary based on the data we have for January this far. ","Looking further into the first quarter, we faced more difficult comps in February and March. Our advanced booked seat factor is solid, up one point domestically, however we do see a reduction in advanced book seat factor in the pacific, primarily due to the shift of the Chinese New Year from February last year to January this year, which moved bookings earlier in the year in 2012.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Zane.","Zane Rowe","Thanks Jim. I\u2019d like to start by thanking the entire United team for all their effort in helping produce a strong profit in 2011, while managing through our merger integration. ","United\u2019s consolidated operating expense increased approximately 10% or $3.2 billion year-over-year in 2011 as fuel costs increased nearly $3 billion compare to the previous year. Excluding the impact of hedges, fuel prices rose 29% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 38% for the full year. ","Full year consolidated and mainline unit costs increased 10% year-over-year. Holding fuel rates and profit sharing constant, consolidated unit cost were up 1.1% as we continued company wide efforts to control costs and realize efficiencies from the merger. In the fourth quarter consolidated unit costs, the holding fuel rate and profit sharing constants were up 0.5% while we reduced capacity nearly 3%. ","This year we made good progress integrating the two subsidiaries and generated over $400 million of synergy value, slightly exciding our expectations established at the time of the merger. In addition to the over $250 million of revenue synergies, our integration efforts yielded $150 million of cost synergies in 2011. We accrued an additional $23 million in profit sharing this quarter for a total of $265 million for the year. ","Non-operating expense was $191 million for the quarter and $977 million for the full year. Interest expense decreased by nearly a $100 million this year, as we delevered the balance sheet and retired some higher priced debt. For the year we incurred $59 million of fuel hedge ineffectiveness expense associated with our WTI hedge positions. ","Our fourth quarter profit was $109 million and our full year profit was $1.3 billion, generating a per-tax margin of 3.6% for the year. This resulted in a 11% return on invested capital, nicely exceeding our cost of capital. We are pleased with this result in light of the economic challenges we faced and it illustrates the improvements we\u2019ve made managing through periods of adversity.","Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the year with $8.3 billion of liquidity, including an un-drawn $500 million revolving credit facility that we entered into during the fourth quarter. The facility provides attractively priced additional liquidity while we pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet. ","During the quarter we generated $265 million of operating cash flow and growth capital expenditures were $204 million. We again reduced debt this quarter, paying $494 million in debt and capital lease obligations, including $71 million of prepayments. For the year we paid down $2.6 billion of scheduled maturities and debt prepayment. ","Reduced capacity in 2011 by two percentage points versus our expectations at the beginning of the year, as we responded to the rise in cost of fuel and the economic environment. As Jim mentioned, we currently expect our 2012 capacity to be flat to down for year and down slightly in the first quarter. We will continue to be prudent about our level of capacity deployment. ","In 2012 we faced cost pressure as a result of our decision to increase investment in the business and inflation in certain areas. We are making a number of product improvements, such as increasing staffing at the airport to enhance our customers experience, deploying Economy Plus across the continental mainline fleet and improving our food offerings in the premium cabins. ","We are chaining aspects of our maintenance program to improve the condition and reliability of our aircraft. We will also see cost pressure in some areas, including pension expense due to historically low interest relates, as well as wage and benefit expense as we\u2019ve made progress on a number of our labor agreements. ","We expect to achieve an incremental $200 million of cost synergies in 2012. As a result, we expect our consolidated unit costs, excluding fuel, profit sharing and in salary business expense to be up 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year in the first quarter and the full year of 2012. ","As we disclosed in our December investor update, we are now excluding ancillary business expense from our core unit cost. The revenue associated with this is recorded in the other revenue line. ","Ancillary business are those associated with activities that do not generate seat miles. These include components of the MileagePlus program such as non-air mileage revenue and redemption expense, as well as services for third parties including maintenance, ground handling and catering. Ancillary business expense is expected to be approximately $65 million in the first quarter and $340 million for the full year of 2012. ","Based on the forward curve, as of January 18 we expect our consolidated fuel price to be $3.27 per gallon in the first quarter and the full year. We\u2019ve hedged approximately 48% of our expected first quarter fuel consumption at an average Gulf Coast jet equivalent of $3.24 per gallon. We\u2019ve hedged approximately 32% of our expected fuel consumption for the full year 2012 using a combination of collars, swaps and calls. ","We have $1.3 billion of scheduled debt maturities and capital lease payments in the year. While we are committed to strengthening the balance sheet in 2012, we are also mindful of the need to invest in the business. We continue to refresh our fleet with modern, fuel-efficient aircraft and expect to induct into service 24 new aircrafts this year, comprised on five Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 19 737-900ER aircrafts. As a result we expect gross capital expenditures to be $2.3 billion in 2012 or $1.3 billion net of expected financing. ","As we take delivery of new aircraft, we are retiring older, less efficient aircraft, improving the operating economics of the fleet. We are retiring 22 domestic aircrafts comprised on 17 737-500s and five 757-200s, as well as five international 767-200ERs. ","In 2012 our team of more than 80,000 at United will focus on working together to generate value for all of our stakeholders, by building an airline with great service, competitive products and an unparallel rout network. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call balk over to Jeff. ","Jeffery Smisek ","Thanks Zane. Our results in 2011 were solid. I\u2019m proud of what my co-workers were able to accomplish in such a challenging year and I want to thank them all for their hard work. 2012 will be a very exciting year as we substantially complete our integration and continue to build the world\u2019s leading airline; the airline customers want to fly, co-workers want to work for and investors want to invest in.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tyler to open it up for questions. ","Tyler Reddian"," ","Thank you Jeff. First we\u2019ll take questions from the analyst community, then we\u2019ll take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Michelle, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead. ","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","","Thank you. Good morning. ","Jim Compton","Good morning Hunter.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","","So I guess after Delta got its single operating certificate after the Northwest merger, there was a little bit of revenue dis-synergies that they experienced and they ended performing in the industry for a few months before really starting to outperform what really amounted about a year later after SOC. ","So as we look at December PRASM which was a little softer and January came actually a lot better than I was expecting, so I will mention that, but do you think that its possible or its probable that there was some hiccup on the revenue side because of sort of post SOC, maybe integration, I don\u2019t want to say headaches, but unforeseen difficulties and might the revenue synergies now shift to sort of be a back half of the year, should we expect you guys to think about outperforming in PRASM maybe in the back half of 2012 and may be expect a few more hiccups over the next three to four months. ","Jim Compton","Hey Hunter, this is Jim. I think a couple of comments on that. I would first say that I don\u2019t think there was anything that was unexpected. One example I\u2019ll give you is that in early December we moved to a single optimizer in the revenue management perspective. In preparing for that, we tool a little bit more conservative view in how we would handle bookings and so forth and that would have an effect on yield closer in. So not unexpected, so I want to be sure that I\u2019m clear on that. ","What we wanted to do was make sure that as we move into 2012 with the single optimizer, which is now forecasting from one system that we captured the synergies that we were expecting from that. So to your point, there are things that were happening. Still the other piece is that we are operating on two systems in a number of areas still. ","As Jeff mentioned in his comments we are really looking forward to the PSS integration in March. That will allow us to begin to capture many of the synergies across the network. So I think your point is a good one, I think the synergies will begin to move quicker obviously after we\u2019re passed PSS. ","One of the things, and another example in that is that we are moving to the continental.com site we will be renamed united.com. So even through we moved past PSS, what we\u2019ll quickly do is close what we call as some of the PSS gaps, so that on united.com there\u2019s ancillary products such as premier line and other products like that that generate revenue that the continental.com sites did not have. ","So there will be that period of time that we\u2019ll quickly, working with our technology folks to get those applications on to the new united.com site, which again will give us a little bit of time to recapture that revenue to move on and then at the same point begin to introduce new products.","So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful, but I would say things aren\u2019t unexpected, but we realize that for operating under two systems in certain areas, its not only difficult for our customers, our employees, that does create I call it some friction to invest in the network that we\u2019re working through and we\u2019ll get it with PSS.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","All right Jim, thanks. No, that is helpful. And Jeff, I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on labor for a second here. You mentioned the new leadership, obviously United ALPA. Have you had conversations with Captain Hepper (ph) yet and do you feel like any kind of ground was lost with the transaction leadership, any kind of progress you would have made under our (Inaudible) ALPA administration and maybe a brief update on where you stand or the pilots stand on seniority less integration. Thanks. ","","Jim Compton ","","Sure. Yes, I\u2019ve visited with Jay already a couple of times, Jay Heppner (ph). I now have two Jay\u2019s, so I have to distinguish between who is the Jay and I think in terms of progress loss, I think as the former United ALPA leader was sort of winding down, there was a period of time which we obviously couldn\u2019t really make a progress, but now that we have a new leader I think we can. I visited with Jay about this, so he really does have a tremendous opportunity, kind of an inflection point here to be constructive and responsible and to move this process forward and I hope that he will do so. ","","As for other details of the negotiations or the pilots discussions regarding a senior, a single seniored list, I won\u2019t comment on those, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate at this time. ","","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","","All right, thanks. ","","Operator","","Our next question comes form Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley ","","Hi there, good morning. Zane, a question on the guidance, the chasm guidance. When you gave it, does it include an assumption about occurring for future labor contracts or is that something that we have to work in later as we get closer to CBA. ","","Zane Rowe ","","Bill, it includes what we call from our normal GAAP assumption. So it includes what we are assuming today. ","","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley ","","Okay and the Jim or Jeff, when you look back at your time at Continental, when you were dealing with competitor bankruptcies, did you notice that there was any material corporate market share gains or did that not really play a roll in discussion at that time. ","","Jim Compton ","","Yes, it really didn\u2019t play. I would say I really never saw significant change I think, particularly over time as the market place I think understands chapter 11 and so forth. So I think what we are seeing on the corporate side is really related to the network and the strength of the network as our sales force gets out there and communicates the value of this new enterprise going forward. So anything that we see, its really we think directly, really related to vast and correspondent to kind of our sales force talking about the value of the new enterprise. ","","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley ","Yes, so if there were any gains, then given the Americans bankruptcy would problem come more from their network changing and yours having an advantage; is that fair?","Jim Compton","Yes, I think that\u2019s right. I think the networks change as people understand. You mean it\u2019s incremental value the new United now brings. I think that you will see that volume move appropriately. ","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley ","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you for the time. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank ","Hey, everyone. This is a question for Jim. Jim you talked about the Pacific being historically a very profitable part of the business and when you look at sort of where the bookings are, they are down a bit. ","I know you pointed to the calendar with the New Year, yet you did highlight in the fourth quarter I guess the premium cabin to China was good domestic or the economy looked like it was actually PRASM and yields were down. ","I mean are we also seeing besides the calendar, are we seeing a little bit maybe China in the midst of a soft landing here. I mean any additional color would be helpful, particularly when you look at maybe the Delta numbers and maybe because their pacific is more Japan oriented. They had a much higher PRASM gain in the quarter. What can you tell us about that? ","Jim Compton","Okay Michael. Just a couple of thoughts. I think as you think about China, I think its more related quite frankly to capacity. So for us in Chicago to Hong Kong, Cathay started flying in the market in September and so forth and so there is that increased capacity. ","We have Shanghai flying, so over the year we started at that, transferring. They operate at really high revenue performances, but I do think those are things that put a pressure on the PRASM in China relative to Japan, because obviously if we look at our Japan versus China we see significant PRASM relative to what we are seeing in China. So I think its more the capacity side than anything. ","What we are really comfortable about at this point is one of the high level profitability those markets bring to us, but we are also seeing good strength in the premium cabin even as we look forward and as much as you like to see the book load factor, I\u2019m always a little bit more happy that its in the leisure of things relative to the premium cabin. ","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank ","Okay and then just as a follow-up on that, your ATI JV (Inaudible), that is now up and running right and what I just, I want to get a confirmation on that, and what have you seen since you started to integrate that. Does that include the Chinese routes or is it just purely the US and Japan. ","Jim Compton","It\u2019s the Japan routes in there and as well as the Singapore, Taipei, I\u2019m getting the list of the different Hong Kong markets that are off in that. So it\u2019s a little bit, it\u2019s a basket of different markets out there, now totally inclusive of all of the Pacific. ","I would say that like the Trans-Atlantic it\u2019s a phase-in type of JV, so a lot of the teams have been working very closely, harmonizing some of the pricing, quite frankly getting to know each other and how each company kind of thinks about the market place as we talked about the U.S. point of sale and ANA learns from that and we learn a lot from ANA on the Japan point of sale. So a lot of great work, but its a phased approach and its very early into the phase. ","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank "," ","Okay, very good, thanks. That\u2019s all I need to know. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore Partners. Please go ahead. ","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners ","","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up to an earlier question regarding your systems cut over here in the first quarter. Is there a period of time around that, where you might sort of throttle back or maybe not be able to push as hard on revenue as you might otherwise. I understand there is synergy potential that you can\u2019t realize today that\u2019s on the other side of this, but I\u2019m just thinking, as we think about the cutover, is there a migration period where you might have to not push as hard as you otherwise would. ","Jeffery Smisek","Duane, this is Jeff. Around the date of the cutover, we are taking some of the load off the airports, but that\u2019s for a very short period of time. We are also obviously staffing up for that period of time, we\u2019ve got a large number of people around the system who are experts in shares; they are called success teams around the systems, so we are confident about the cutover, but I think that that portion of it is actually fairly modest in terms of the revenue effect. ","Jim Compton","Yes Duane, this is Jim. I\u2019ll just add to it with my comments about moving to a single optimizer right. One of the reasons we wanted to move quickly working with our technology partners and the revenue management folks is so that we can be up and running as quickly as possible. So we are actually, the forecasting we are doing for demand is now an improved system, a one system across the whole network. So to Jeff\u2019s point, I think its really kind of a rounded data of PSS itself. ","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","","Okay, thanks very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes form Glenn Engel from Bank of America. Please go ahead. \t","Glenn Engel - Bank of America ","Good morning, a couple of questions. When you touched on the underperformance of the Asian routes, but the European routes also look lower than the ATA data. Can you talk about what was driving that? ","Jim Compton","Yes, I thought we did pass the 2% in the Trans-Atlantic with about a 3.7% increase in PRASM. So I think in the Trans-Atlantic, really across our whole system, as you think about capacity discipline, we\u2019ve always kind of \u2013 it\u2019s very much adhered to capacity discipline, but also kind of stabled capacity and not having really big swings in capacity, because we think over the long term that\u2019s the best way to manage directly. ","We very much know that that work we have, you can\u2019t duplicate it and the reason you can\u2019t duplicate it, because it\u2019s built through a global network. I mean it\u2019s built because of those gateways that we have in particular. ","So we take a long term view of these markets rather than kind of a shorter term view that we feel really confident about. I also think that as we move across PSS, the way we are thinking about it, is that we\u2019ll begin to see how the traffic flows across the network, right and as traffic flows across the network and we are on a single code, a single optimizer, we\u2019ll keep our due-diligence on watching capacity, but we also wonder too where that traffics going to flow as we move forward. ","Glenn Engel - Bank of America ","Did you say how much the yearly Chinese New Year is benefiting January\u2019s PRASM? ","Jim Compton","Yes, no I did comment on that. ","Glenn Engel - Bank of America ","And finally on the cost side, I\u2019m looking at the non-sealed chasm growth of the mainline up about five, and the non-filed chasm of the right, regional down about six. What\u2019s driving that big divergence? ","Jim Compton","Glenn, what period are you looking at? I mean I don\u2019t think \u2013 there is nothing there that\u2026","Glenn Engel - Bank of America ","This is the forecast. ","Jim Compton","Right, so there is nothing there that\u2019s sort of out of the ordinary, more than what I talked about with some of the pressure that you\u2019ve seen on salaries and the benefit line and then sort of the natural shift that you see, as you move more internationally, as we walk through the course of the year, we expect to see a little bit of cost pressures across the line items, but nothing more than that. ","Glenn Engel - Bank of America ","But why would the regional be down so much? ","Jim Compton","That may just be a little bit of a mix issue as well, with some of the higher gauge regional aircraft and just shifting a little bit across the fleet there. ","Glenn Engel - Bank of America ","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Baker from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Jamie Baker - JP Morgan","Hey, good morning everybody. ","Jim Compton","Hi Jamie.","Jamie Baker - JP Morgan","Jeff, on the subject of the March cutover to shares you spoke about having tested everything already, I\u2019m sure you have. But my question is, what happens if the cutover doesn\u2019t go as planed. I can\u2019t help but think about seeing for more gains, you know what, I couldn\u2019t shut the computer off. I mean can you\u2026","Zane Rowe","Jamie, Jamie, we have a couple of things. One, we\u2019ve had four full-scale dress rehearsals and all the data transfers and all the things that were appropriate. We have numerous amount of support both from travel port which runs ALPA, our former PSS and HP, they run shares for us as well, an enormous amount of preparation, but we also of course are being prudent, have the ability during the conversion itself to roll back. We also have some ability to roll forward; that is to do some postponement as well if we need to. So we\u2019ve been pretty thoughtful, careful and conservative in this. We are exceeding well prepared for it. ","There are literally thousands of people that work on this, not only from a technology perspective, but the training of our United co-workers who have traditionally been working on ALPA, being trained in the shares and a large number of continental people in our success team literally around the globe for assistance. So I\u2019m confident that this will go as planed, but as you point out being prudent, we also have the scenarios in case if we have some unforeseen issues. ","","Jamie Baker - JP Morgan","Perfect, that\u2019s what I hoped to here and second, just on the ancillary business expense, based on the restatements for last year, it doesn\u2019t look like these expenses, I guess this is designed that there is any particular seasonality to them, is that the right way to be kind of thinking about growth in the business going forward? ","Jim Compton","I think that\u2019s right Jamie. I think we touched on the MileagePlus component as being a great growth story. This portion of that will actually not have the same seasonal attributes that I would say is the portion obviously tied to the airline dose. So you are exactly right and that\u2019s where we expect to see the growth and expense, see the commeasure growth and revenue obviously on the other revenue line. ","Jamie Baker - JP Morgan","Yes, okay terrific. Thank you very much gentlemen.","Jim Compton","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Crissey from UBS. Please go ahead. ","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","All right, thanks. Your CapEx number is kind of what I would have thought, but it\u2019s a decent sized number with the fleet changes. How should we think about your maintenance CapEx when I look at Delta running at kind of 1314 overall, you guys running higher than that now. What is maintenance CapEx and would you expect to be able to generate free cash flow with your current CapEx for \u201912.","Jim Compton","Kevin I would break out the aircraft portion from what I\u2019d even call sort of aircraft related and other CapEx. Obviously even as you separate the acquisition of the new aircraft for this year, you still have a slight buy wave (ph) given all the improvements we are making in the products and all the improvement we are marking really across the fleet, whether its operational improvements or otherwise putting lie-flat beds on some of the light bodies and narrow bodies, so I would separate that. ","We are clearly in a buy wave (ph) and we\u2019ve also spread out our CapEx a little bit. We ended up a little bit lower than our guidance was for last year. So we are pretty comfortable with where we are, although I\u2019ll tell you, we are a little bit higher than where we\u2019d be normally and then the big bump that you see this year is driven by the 787s and obviously the 73s. ","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Okay, and in terms of just ability to generate free cash off of that type of CapEx. ","Jim Compton","I mean, we are still comfortable with what our projections are and our ability to generate free cash flow, yes. I mean obviously it depends upon your definition about how you think about the new aircraft acquisitions, but we are quite comfortable with those decisions and obviously especially with the 787. I mean that truly is a game changer and I think you\u2019ll see the difference on the operating line items. ","Kevin Crissey \u2013 UBS","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Chase from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead."," ","Gary Chase - Barclays Capital ","","Good morning everybody. I wanted to see if I could just ask one of Jim. In the fall-wint and started with reasonably comprehensive shift in the network as you were cutting capacity domestically. Just wondering what your experience is with revenue retention there and wondering if you feel like there are incremental opportunities to do that without sacrificing revenue and driving that home on the PRASM line. ","Jim Compton","Yes, a couple of comments. I think in terms of revenue retention, I think the revenue retention is there. I think it depends on the market and what we did. There are certain markets that we update with capacity given the new fleet that we have and to a certain extent its also like that piece of the up page is like a new market, right, that you wanted to school and build and so forth and you worked that and build it, as fast as the revenue management system learns about the capacity changes. But from a retention point of view we saw no loss in revenue given kind of aircraft relocation. ","You know I think a lot of the things we did also were to drive PRASM was to do something that we think, particularly around holidays and thanksgiving and things like that, that historically weren\u2019t done on one subsidiary that was done on the other. So all in all the changes we\u2019ve made have worked pretty well. ","Gary Chase - Barclays Capital","And do you think they kind of picked up immediately or is there some learning curve associated with that as well? ","Jim Compton","I think there is clearly, to be frank that there is some learning curve. Depending on the market again we\u2019re right sizing it and so at a market where the gauge went down and demand was there, obviously we saw the revenue performance relative to it pretty immediately, but where you\u2019re up-gauging, you actually do need time to work in it and just let it spill out.","Gary Chase - Barclays Capital","","And just as a quick nip; there\u2019s nothing in last year\u2019s January that would have affected this comp, right? ","Jim Compton","No","Gary Chase - Barclays Capital","","Okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Josh Freed from the Associated Press. Please go ahead. ","Josh Freed - Associated Press ","Hi there. Can you say a little more about the switch over on the website. You mentioned that you\u2019re going to be taking continental.com and renaming that as united.com. Is there something in particular about the current continental site as opposed to the current united site that you are interested in maintaining? You know what is it that the customers are going to see I guess once you make that switch and why go with the Continental version rather than the United version. ","Jeffery Smisek","Well, the main reason, the fundamental reason is we\u2019ve moved to the shares passenger service system and the continental.com works obviously off of the shared systems. So kind of the main driving force with the overall system that we moved to, that being shares. Both websites are terrific websites in the market place. They both get really high satisfaction rates from some of the research and so forth and both sites have lots of functionality, lots of different applications and so forth, but really the movement to continental.com was driven by the fundamental fact that we are on the shares now.","Josh Freed - Associated Press ","All right. And have you said how long you expect that you\u2019ll have integration expenses that were at the level that we saw in this most recent quarter. I think it was $173 million. I mean, is that the kind of thing we are going to see for many quarters to come or what point does that taper off? ","Jim Compton","Josh we don\u2019t typically forecast that portion on the expenses, but obviously as you would expect, at least through the first half of this year you would expect to see a similar run rate I\u2019d say. ","Josh Freed - Associated Press ","All right, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mary Jane Credeur from Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. ","Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News","Hi Jim. I\u2019ve got a question about the outlook for the rest of the year in Europe specifically. I know you guys addressed that a little earlier on the call and in the Investor Outlook, but it sounds like you\u2019re a little bit more optimistic than you were on the last call and that seems to be on line with what we heard obviously from your pears. Can you elaborate a little bit more about Europe? Have things bottomed and are they looking better than they did? ","Jim Compton","This is Jim. I think its focusing specifically on Europe. We do see the book load factor down year-over-year. We are seeing strength in the premium cabin versus the economy cabin, which does say that the challenges in the euro zone, from the economics and so forth is having more of a difficult time on the leisure traffic, but clearly the business traffic, particularly out of the US is still relatively strong as we talk to our corporate travel partners. But there is a softening in demand as a result of the issues that are happening in Europe. ","Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News","And a question about the New York market, there\u2019s a lot of activity happening there. Delta and US Airways have got their slots approved and they are about to pull the trigger on those schedule changes soon. Delta\u2019s got their new JFK terminal that will open soon. American Airlines has been a little distracted by the bankruptcy. What does all this mean to the New United for both business and leisure passengers out of New York and are you winning market share there. ","Jim Compton","Well, our market share is very steady and we do see shares shifting among other carriers, but our market share is very steady in the New York area. For us its business as usual. We\u2019ve been there a long time; we\u2019ve been in markets; we\u2019ve invested in the facility; we continue to invest in the facility over the years with lounges and so forth, so for us its kind of business as usual. ","At the same time knowing that it is a competitive market place, so our sales force is out there as I mentioned earlier, talking about the value of this network and the value that it brings to the enterprise. But New York for us is actually a very interesting market that\u2019s different than other folks, right, in terms of our ability to use that facility. ","Its more than just about the local market, right. It\u2019s a terrific connecting hub and most of the connections through our hub are actually international. So we are the only carrier that has really what I call the true connecting hub, single connecting hub in New York, so for us that\u2019s strength. We see steady market share as I mentioned and we think the benefits of the network and as give PS, past PSS we will actually bring more value to the customer in New York. ","Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News"," ","So you anticipate that market share is climbing in the next few years? ","Jim Compton ","We are about managing towards returns and so I want to be careful when I talk about market share, because what we are really trying to do is generate stable and sustainable profits, right and our New York strategy is going to play in that, just as much as it plays across our whole network. ","Mary Jane Credeur - Bloomberg News","Great, thank you Jim.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronnie Crocker from Houston Chronicle. Please go ahead.","Ronnie Crocker - Houston Chronicle ","Thanks. I have a question about Houston specifically. When you talk about the capacity and what happened in 2011 which forecasted in 2012, where does Bush Intercontinental stand and \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Bush International Airport stand and how did the Latin American growth effect that. ","Jeffery Smisek","Ronnie, this is Jeff. Our Houston hub is our largest by departures and its an incredibly important part of our network, its our gateway to Latin America. Latin America right now is a very strong entity for us. We\u2019ve had significant year-over-year unit revenue growth. It is an important market for us; it will remain an important market for us. You\u2019ve seen us recently announce a new international service out of Houston. We started Houston Legos (ph); we\u2019ve announced Houston Auckland. I think you will continue to see Houston be very important to the new United. ","Ronnie Crocker - Houston Chronicle","And so do you see any flights being cut out of here and when these five new Dreamliners arrive, how many of them will be flying in or out of Intercontinental?","","Jim Compton","","Hey Ronnie, this is Jim here. A lot of those plans aren\u2019t formalized now, but adding on to Jeff\u2019s points now, we\u2019ve launched Houston Lego (ph). Just last week our Chief Operating Officer there was breaking ground on Terminal B, Phase I expansion. So to Jeff\u2019s point, its our biggest hub. Quite frankly our corporate travel business, the biggest factor is our energy business. So Houston is really important to us and its going to be really important to us in the future. ","Ronnie Crocker - Houston Chronicle","Okay, thank you. ","Nene Foxhall","Okay with that we are out of time, so we\u2019ll conclude. Thanks to all of you for joining us today.

These items are detailed in our earnings release.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, Chairman, President and CEO of United.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Thanks, Nene and Jonathan, and thank you, all, for joining us on our second quarter 2014 earnings call. Today, we reported pretax earnings of $921 million, an increase of more than $300 million year-over-year. We earned $2.34 per diluted share, a 49% increase, versus of the second quarter of last year. We're pleased that our second quarter unit revenue performance exceeded our initial guidance, and that our quarterly nonfuel unit cost decreased year-over-year.","Our second quarter financial performance reflects the progress we're making on initiatives we've been implementing over the last few quarters. Our revenue management and network improvements are delivering as expected. We're exhibiting excellent cost control. We're making disciplined aircraft investments that are improving our fuel efficiency, and we're continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. While we're pleased with the progress we made during the quarter, our entire management team is focused on continuing to improve our overall financial performance. We have a strong plan in place and our team is committed to executing against it. We are working to accelerate our revenue growth. We have a tremendous set of assets, and we'll take the appropriate actions with our network and fleet to maximize the revenue we produce from those assets.","In a few minutes, Jim will walk you through the steps we're taking to optimize our network, regional operation and revenue management, all with the goal of improving our revenue and margin performance. At the same time, we continue to execute on Project Quality, our $2 billion annual cost savings program, to make meaningful gains in quality and efficiency. Our employees have played a large part in this initiative, and I thank them for identifying and implementing durable, high-quality improvements across our business. I ascribe much of our excellent second quarter unit cost performance to the progress we're making in this area, and I'm confident that our team will continue to execute at a high level going forward.","In what is perhaps the clearest demonstration of our confidence and our ability to achieve the goals of a long-term plan we laid out at our Investor Day last fall, we announced this morning $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete within the next 3 years. We've made significant progress improving our overall capital structure, and initiating a shareholder return program is another step towards achieving a more balanced allocation of cash flow. We are firmly committed to increasing the value we create for our shareholders, and our share repurchase program is indicative of that commitment. John will walk you through this program in greater detail in just a few minutes.","During the second quarter, we faced difficult operating conditions, particularly due to multi-month runway closures at our gateway San Francisco and Newark hubs. Our team stepped up throughout, demonstrating their professionalism, running a solid operation and providing good customer service. We're focused on running a more reliable and efficient operation with a consistently high-quality product and service offering, and are confident in our ability to continue to improve in these areas.","We made significant strides in the second quarter towards our goals, but recognize that we have much work ahead to achieve United's full potential. We have very experienced, highly skilled employees who are committed to our success. We'll continue to take the appropriate actions and make the necessary changes to get us to the level of earnings our shareholders and this management team expect. Now I will turn the call over to Jim and John.","James E. Compton","Thanks, Jeff. First, I'd like to reiterate Jeff's recognition of our employees for running a reliable airline this quarter, while continuing to operate more efficiently. I'd also like to thank our customers for choosing United. We are working hard every day to improve the flyer-friendly experience we deliver and we appreciate your business.","In the second quarter, United's consolidated PRASM grew 3.7% on approximately flat capacity year-over-year, above our original PRASM guidance range of 1% to 3%. The improvement, relative to guidance, was primarily driven by better-than-expected performance in the Pacific and domestic regions.","We've been on a path to optimize our Pacific footprint, and we're beginning to see benefits from the changes we've implemented. We're restructuring our Asia flying to leverage our West Coast hubs, flying west from Tokyo to Asian destinations; and instead, flying directly from the West Coast to secondary Asian cities. We've recently added 2 new Pacific routes, San Francisco to Taipei and San Francisco to Chengdu, and they are both performing better than expected. We've also optimized our 747 deployment after investing in the fleet's reliability last year. As part of the 747 optimization, we've more appropriately matched capacity with demand in Australia by downgauging our flying to 777 aircraft, and we saw a double-digit PRASM increase in Australia in the second quarter.","In addition, we experienced better-than-anticipated yields this quarter in China, despite the added competitive capacity, with yields in China slightly positive year-over-year. We expect this positive trend to continue through the peak summer months. Although we anticipate that accelerating industry capacity growth in China will put pressure on yields after the seasonal peak. That said, we are seeing the benefits of the actions we've taken to grow our leading Pacific franchise, and we'll continue to take the appropriate steps to build on this area of strength for United.","In the second quarter, our consolidated domestic unit revenue grew nearly 6%. The largest unit revenue gain of all entities, driven by a solid demand environment, as well as strong execution on our revenue management initiatives. The improvements we've made to optimize our booking curve, taking fewer early bookings and holding more seat inventory for later, higher-yielding bookings drove approximately 0.75 point of consolidated PRASM growth in the second quarter. We expect to drive 1 full point of year-over-year PRASM growth in the third quarter. Additionally, we recently restructured the premium cabin fares on many of our domestic and short-haul Latin flights. This initiative drove our consolidated paid premium-cabin load factor up 5 points, to 47%, and it resulted in approximately 0.5 point of consolidated PRASM growth in the second quarter.","We continue to make gains with our corporate partners. In the second quarter, revenue for large corporate accounts, which is what we've typically reported, grew by 3%, despite decreased year-over-year corporate revenue in April due to the Easter holiday shift. Additionally, we're seeing good growth from the rest of our corporate portfolio, primarily from our PerksPlus product, which is a points-based loyalty program for small- to medium-size businesses. Our overall corporate portfolio, inclusive of PerksPlus, grew approximately 6% in the second quarter.","Ancillary revenue grew at a solid clip in the second quarter, increasing 7.9% per passenger. Our paid premium upgrade product performed extremely well in the second quarter, with a 28% revenue increase year-over-year. In alignment with the domestic premium cabin pricing at the time of booking, that I spoke about earlier, we've taken a similar approach with our premium cabin upgrade product. We're restructuring the prices and improving the targeting of our product and customer marketing, and are seeing a material increase in take rates and revenue as a result.","As Jeff said, while we are pleased that we exceeded our guidance for the second quarter, we have significant opportunities to improve on these results. My team is intent on doing just that. We have a comprehensive effort underway to improve our revenue and margin performance. The initiative falls into 3 broad categories: network and scheduling, our regional operation and revenue management. We have identified meaningful areas of opportunity in each of these areas. And while many of the changes we'll make in these areas will yield near-term benefits, several of the changes will take a period of time to implement and drive results. I'll highlight a few of the examples of these initiatives, but be assured that we have identified and will continue to identify additional opportunities.","First, in the network and scheduling area. We plan to redesign the flight bank structure at our Chicago hub, as well as at our Denver and Houston hubs, which we announced last quarter. We will implement these changes between the fourth quarter of this year and the spring of 2015. These changes will allow us to build more efficient, directional flows and shorten connection times.","Beginning this fall, we are adding more seasonal shaping to our schedule, increasing the amount of flying we do in the seasonal peaks and decreasing our schedule during the trough periods. For example, in 2015, we expect to fly approximately 25% more capacity in July versus February, compared to just 13% in 2012. We will accomplish this by more optimally timing our maintenance visits, flight crew training and flight crew hiring.","We will continue to make disciplined and thoughtful decisions regarding the comprehensive structure and performance of our overall network. As we've consistently said, each hub has to earn its place in the network, and we will make return-driven decisions regarding the optimal hub network for United. Further, we are working to maximize the utility of our gate and slot portfolio to increase the scale and operability of better performing hubs. We are excited about the long-term revenue opportunities these network and scheduling initiatives will drive. It is important to recognize that changes in this area, by their very nature, are more strategic and will take more time to implement than some of the other areas of our business.","We also have a significant opportunity to optimize our regional operations. In particular, continuing to reduce the number of 50-seat aircraft in our fleet and improving the reliability of our regional flying. Over the course of this year and next, we will remove the equivalent of more than 130 50-seat regional jets from our schedule. We will replace 70 of these with 76-seat Embraer 175s that we are now taking delivery of. And many, we will not replace at all. At the beginning of this year, we flew approximately 8% of our overall capacity with 50-seat and smaller aircraft. But by the end of 2015, we expect that to decline to only 5% of our total capacity.","We are also taking a number of actions to improve the reliability of our regional operation beyond simply flying fewer 50-seat jets. One particular area of focus is reducing the complexity of our regional flying by consolidating the number of regional flying partners we utilize in a given hub. We are also reducing the number of hubs from which we -- which regional partners operate. For example, today, we have 8 express operators flying out of our Washington Dulles hub, and we will reduce that to just 4 partners by this September. By concentrating on our regional operations with fewer regional carriers in a hub, we will reduce complexity and variability, and thus drive improved reliability. We expect the changes we'll make in our regional operations will have a revenue benefit, as we improve our predictability and our onboard product; as well as a cost benefit, as we'll be flying much more efficient E175s instead of 50-seat aircraft.","These examples illustrate only a few of the opportunities we have to grow United's revenue. Through the enhancements we'll make to our network, our schedule, our regional operation and our approach to revenue management, we will significantly improve our revenue performance over the next 18 months. We'll provide more detail on our progress in the coming quarters.","For the third quarter, we expect PRASM to grow between 2% and 4%, on capacity growth of between 0.2% and 1.2% year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect capacity to be between flat and up 1%, 1 full point lower than the guidance we provided at the beginning of 2014.","In conclusion, I'm pleased with our improved performance. However, we still have significant runway ahead. My team and I are committed to improving our revenue growth, and we are very optimistic about our strategy to do so.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Rainey","Thanks, Jim, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I would also like to thank our employees for their efforts in the second quarter. Throughout the company, we are making long-term, sustainable improvements, and I appreciate everyone's hard work in developing and implementing these important initiatives.","Today, we reported $921 million of pretax income for the second quarter, generating earnings per diluted share of $2.34. This represents a pretax margin of 8.9%, an improvement of nearly 3 points year-over-year. Additionally, in the second quarter, we generated $1.5 billion of operating cash flow, and nearly $600 million of free cash flow. While we are pleased with our improvement, we have significant opportunity to expand upon these results to generate the level of earnings we expect.","Second quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, was 0.2% lower year-over-year, much better than our initial expectation for the quarter. Results from our cost-saving initiatives during the quarter exceeded our expectations, and we also renegotiated certain maintenance contracts. Additionally, some expenses we originally anticipated to incur in the second quarter shifted into the third.","Year-to-date, our CASM performance have exceeded our expectations, despite the fact that we reduced our capacity by more than 1 point in the first half of the year from our initial plan for 2014. We expect this strong performance to continue in the second half of the year, with third quarter and full year nonfuel CASM each increasing between 1% and 2%.","I attribute much of our good cost performance to outstanding execution of our Project Quality initiative. This initiative is designed to generate $2 billion of annual cost savings by 2017. Through Project Quality, our team is making fundamental, permanent changes to how we do business. For 2014, we expect to achieve nearly $200 million in fuel efficiency savings, and approximately $300 million in nonfuel savings from this initiative, which is at the high end of the range we previously provided. The progress we're making in this area is clearly evident in our second quarter CASM performance.","One area in which we're seeing meaningful gains already is productivity. In the second quarter, we improved our productivity by 3.9% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. For the full year, we are on track to improve productivity by 3%, versus 2013.","Since our merger, we have evolved how we allocate capital at United. And today, we announced the next phase of our capital allocation plan with a $1 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete within the next 3 years. This amount represents approximately 6% of our market cap. In conjunction with this announcement, we have initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program, which will be completed within the next 3 months. In addition, during the second quarter, we spent $62 million to retire convertible debt, which would've converted into 1.5 million shares of United stock.","Over the last year, I have consistently talked about 2 gating items prior to initiating a shareholder return program. First, we wanted to address the $800 million, 6 3\/4% secured notes, for which we now have a plan in place, and I'll speak to the details shortly. And second, we wanted to have a level of earnings and cash generation that supported the capital distribution to shareholders, and our earnings outlook does just that.","At this time, we believe the best method to distribute capital to shareholders is through a share repurchase program. We have confidence in our earnings potential and believe that we are trading at a discount to our intrinsic value. As we continue to demonstrate progress against our plan, increase our earnings and further pay down debt, we will evaluate if and when we should complement our share repurchase program with a dividend.","In addition to returning cash to our shareholders, our long-term capital structure goals include reducing our non-aircraft-related debt and managing total debt at approximately $15 billion, while maintaining an unrestricted liquidity balance of $5 billion to $6 billion.","In the second quarter, we made $333 million of debt payments; and for the second half of 2014, we expect approximately $575 million of scheduled debt payments. We are seeing a clear benefit from the balance sheet improvements we're making. We expect our 2014 interest expense to be approximately 30% lower, versus just 4 years ago. In keeping with our goal of reducing non-aircraft debt on our balance sheet, we intend to redeem the entire $800 million of 6 3\/4% secured notes. We expect that this redemption will occur this September when the notes become pre-payable at par.","Also in September, we expect to close on a transaction under our existing $1.9 billion credit facility, in which we will increase the size of our undrawn revolving credit facility by $350 million to a total of $1.35 billion, and issue an additional $500 million tranche of term loan debt. These transactions will allow us to reduce our balance sheet debt and interest expense, while continuing to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity. As we look forward, our debt and capital lease payments over the next 4 years are approximately $1.1 billion annually, about half of what our annual maturities have been over the last 4 years.","In addition to reducing our debt, we are making high return investments in our business. In the third quarter, we expect approximately $650 million of gross capital expenditures. We plan to take delivery of 4 737-900ERs and 2 787s, including our first 787-9 during the quarter. We introduced our first 7 highly efficient Embraer 175s in the second quarter and we expect to take an additional 12 in the third. We expect to have 70 of these operating by the end of 2015. Additionally, we are working to meaningfully reduce our capital expenditures over the next 4 years by working with the aircraft manufacturers and continuing to explore opportunities in the used aircraft market.","I'm encouraged by our second quarter financial performance and by the progress in our Project Quality initiative. We expect to expand earnings year-over-year in the third quarter and to continue this momentum as we move forward. We are pleased to take an initial step toward returning cash to our shareholders, and we'll continue to make prudent, return-driven investments in our people, fleet, product and technology. Through the actions we've taken, and will continue to take, to improve our revenue and operations, our efforts to improve the efficiency and quality of everything we do and a more balanced allocation of cash flow going forward, we're creating a great foundation for increasing shareholder value.","I'll now turn it over to Jonathan to open up the call for questions.","Jonathan Ireland","Thank you, John. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","So, John, a little bit more on the cash discussion. If we think about your CapEx being about $3 billion a year as of today, next year or in the year -- a couple of years after that, and then you got $1.1 billion in debt payments and then some degree of repo, obviously, going on, how should we think about how much debt you're going to raise, right? So I mean, are you just going to be paying down these -- the $1.1 billion of debt maturities as they come due? How much of the CapEx do you see yourself financing? How much cash comes in that you're going to raise in the capital markets? On a steady-state scenario.","John D. Rainey","Well, Hunter [ph] -- yes. As a general rule, we would expect to finance aircraft with debt. The efficiency in that market right now is outstanding. When we can raise debt at 4% to purchase assets, that's a very good use of cash, that also lowers our overall cost of capital. Where we will be opportunistic with paying down debt is in some of the non-aircraft debt categories. We still have the term loan, as well as several tranches of unsecured debt, which happens also to be at all-time low rates for the airline industry. But the key thing here, Hunter, is balance. We've evolved how we allocate cash flow since our merger. Initially after our merger, the best way to create shareholder value was to continue to delever and derisk this business. We've also made a lot of core investments in the company and in our infrastructure. And we're at a point now where we've complemented that with the first phase of capital distribution to shareholders. And going forward, we will be opportunistic in terms of paying down debt, overfunding our pension, investing in our business and continuing to deploy cash to shareholders.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, and is Greg Hart there?","John D. Rainey","Yes.","Gregory L. Hart","Yes, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Greg, I have a question for you on the regional side and, Jim, you might have some color on this, too. But I was going to ask you, and Jim, you answered a lot of it, is -- obviously, you're kind of consolidating the regional footprint a little bit. And I think a lot of United's problems over the last couple of years can be really tied back to the regional operation, whether it's just basic operational reliability, on-time performance or fleet type, whatever you want to call it. But my question is really, how much of that can you actually control? I mean, if your regional providers are showing up late or behaving badly, how much control do you really have over that? Obviously, you can fire them. But in terms of what you can do to fix it in the immediate term, what can you control and what can you not control on the regional side?","Gregory L. Hart","That's a good question, Hunter. And I think there's certainly lots of things we can control and there's investments, for example, we can make on our end that'll provide a better environment for our regional partners to operate in. For example, as a result of our experience in the first quarter with all the weather, we've invested in a quite a bit of technology that's going to provide the opportunity for us to better cancel flights and provide the regional operators a better chance to recover much quicker than what they have historically been able to do. So that's an example of some of the things we're doing to better facilitate their operations, both in wintertime as well as summer storm times. So there's lots of things we're doing along those lines to help the regional carriers perform better.","Operator","From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker on the line.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can I just ask Greg a question, actually? How -- or somebody said 8% of your operation is regional, and that's going to be declining. Is there a way to determine what percent of your cancellations and, therefore, some of the reliability issues are actually weather-related versus operational difficulties?","Gregory L. Hart","Helane, I think what Jim mentioned, as it relates to the 8%, was 8% of our flying is on 50-seaters and that's declining to...","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Oh, got you.","Gregory L. Hart","5% over the course of the next 18 months or so. Obviously, we track our regional carriers' performance each and every day, and understand each and every flight that is either delayed or canceled and the reasons why. It's something we've got laser-like focused on, and are focused on not only taking advantage of the opportunities that, that data provides, but building better flexibility within the schedule to provide better opportunities to recover. Jim talked about consolidating the number of operators in Dulles, for example. As you can imagine, as we built schedule depth for those operators in Dallas, they've got better capabilities to recover themselves.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, but there's no way to know how much is weather-related, how much is pilots, because of weather, not being available, there's no way to actually determine that?","Gregory L. Hart","Well, for us, we have that data and we measure it every day. It's not anything we talk about publicly, but we have contractual relationships, actually, with our providers that account for weather-related delays differently than mechanical or pilot-driven delay or cancellation.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then could I just ask John a question? I think you mentioned that you thought your shares were -- I think he used the word intrinsically undervalued relative to your peer group. Do you have like an amount that you think you're undervalued by?","John D. Rainey","Nothing that I would want to disclose, Helane. The point being, though, is that we have a lot of confidence in our plan and in our ability to execute on that plan. And if you believe that the preferred method of deploying capital to shareholders is through a share repurchase program, you want to do that at a point where you're trading at a discount to that future earnings potential. We believe that's the inflection point that we're at. We've got a lot of confidence in our plan going forward. And we'll -- we believe that now is the right time to do this for United shareholders.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn on the line.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","John, I wanted to follow up on the repurchase a bit. You described it as sort of the initial step, and I think it's great to see an industrial company do a buyback before they hit their inflection. How do you think about sort of a more steady state return of capital, assuming that all the initiatives play out over the next kind of 18 months or so?","John D. Rainey","Well, you're right, John. This is a first step, and I will add that I think it's a watershed moment in the airline industry, where you have the largest 4 carriers returning cash to shareholders. I think that, that speaks volumes about how this industry has changed, how it's de-risked the business and the sustainability of those earnings going forward. One way that we look at this is the amount of cash that we're deploying relative to our market cap. Today's announcement is about 6% of our market cap. We're going to -- as we begin to act more like an industrial, I think we should begin to measure ourselves more against industrials and have returns of capital that aspire to be similar to those.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. On a separate topic, I'm very interested in the fact that you guys are on the cusp of some major upgauging here, and you have been doing some replacement of aircraft as well. Are there any anecdotes, numbers, sound bites that you can give us in terms of the differential in the economics of different aircraft just to help us kind of model the impact over the next 18 months or so of some of these initiatives, because they sound like they could be meaningful?","John D. Rainey","Are you referring specifically to the used versus new market? Or just in terms of the CapEx materiality, the reduction?","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two things I'd be interested in. Number one, when you think about, perhaps, the per seat CASM x fuel differential, approximately, some of the larger-gauge aircraft you're bringing in versus the 50-seaters that you're swapping out. And secondarily, in the past, you've offered some thoughts on sort of replacement economics and talked about how 737s save you quite a lot of money versus 757s. I'm just trying to kind of put the whole picture together and looking for some more of those data points.","John D. Rainey","Sure. Well, the 70-seater obviously is appreciably better from a CASM perspective than the 50-seat product. Equally, it puts some pressure on the revenue side. Now I think balancing that on the revenue side, just to go there for a second, is that it's a much better product for our customers. And where we're flying a 50-seat RJ today, wingtip to wingtip, with a competitor that's flying a mainline jet, it's an inferior product and customers book away from that. So I view that more as a kind of a scratch on the revenue side, and it provides a fairly material improvement on the cost side. With respect to replacement economics, we've often talked about the fact that for each 757 that we replaced with a 900ER, it's a couple of million dollars to the bottom line each year. One of the things that we're looking at right now is the used aircraft market. And that market varies widely, based upon which aircraft type you're talking about. And I'll give you an example. The 737-800, a 10-year-old 800 is not priced as low, relative to a new 800, as like an Airbus or some of the other older-generation planes. So we need to be opportunistic with respect to which particular aircraft types we look at if we're looking at the used market. But while we do trade maybe some of the operating economics for a plane that's not newer generation, as we've consistently said, one of the ways that we look at returns in this business, and a very important way, is return on invested capital. And where we may be trading the top line, the numerator, the notepad, we're actually benefiting it by the lower invested capital. And so that's one of the factors that we will take into this decision.","James E. Compton","John, this is Jim. I would just add to John's comment on the revenue side. The [indiscernible] of the 50-seaters with the 70-seaters also presents a first-class cabin and Economy Plus cabin. We're excited about the ancillary opportunities. I've mentioned a little bit about what we're seeing on upsell, as well as first-class pricing in the premium cabin domestically. So we're excited about the opportunity that as those 70 airplanes come into the system over the next 18 months, what that will drive on the ancillary side.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, Delta made the point yesterday about their long-standing relationships with -- in United's JV partners within the context of trans-Atlantic pricing and scheduling. Lufthansa has announced some capacity cuts, but apparently -- at least not yet in the Atlantic. I know you don't have veto power over your partners' schedules, but how closely do you coordinate? I mean, can you influence, can you compel more capacity discipline at the Star Alliance level? Or you just -- only at the United mainline level?","James E. Compton","Jamie, so we have a great working relationship with our JV partners. And whether it's Lufthansa, ANA, Air Canada, all of our JV partners, we coordinate very closely on capacity, as well as the pricing and sales -- and the sales agreements that we have in the marketplace. You are right, though, at the end each carrier is free to make decisions that they feel best for them. But I will tell you that the relationships that we have with our JV partners and our coordination is very tight. As we look at the trans-Atlantic capacity, we're relatively flattish in the second quarter. Some of the seasonal shaping that I mentioned in my comments have a direct impact on the trans-Atlantic, in that you'll see our capacity relatively flat in the winter 2015 off [ph] season. But to your point, we work really closely with our JV partners.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I assume that means you share schedules, plan schedules well before they're loaded. You're not like us where you have to rely on monitoring schedule tapes and stuff?","James E. Compton","Absolutely. There's -- the network teams have far-out looking discussions in terms of what capacity and what works for each carrier.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's what I figured. And a question for Greg. When we think about the first quarter's unprecedented meteorological mayhem, if we were to repeat that in winter 2015, are there any particular initiatives you can point to that would make the outcome less severe for you guys? Or, I guess, I don't know, put differently, were there operational takeaways? Or do you just treat last winter's weather as a one-off, sort of Chicago's own, well, Super Typhoon Paka, if you will?","Gregory L. Hart","Jamie, great question, and we are certainly not treating first quarter's weather as a one-off. We are expecting more of the same moving forward, and are preparing for that. And we've got a lot of things ongoing to help us better manage weather events at the airport. And a couple of examples I can point to. One is we're working on a tool that's going to provide the opportunity to better rebook our passengers over our network. Today's tool isn't that sophisticated when it comes to being able to rebook our passengers over every itinerary we can provide in our network. And obviously, with the 7 hubs here in the Continental U.S., we've got a lot of different itineraries that we can put people over. So we're working on a tool that's going to better do that. We also are working on a tool, that I mentioned earlier, that's going to help us better get the airline back on its feet after a winter storm. We're going to cancel flights such that we're going to better understand where our crews are, where they have time, and where the airplanes are to help the airplane recover much quicker than what we have been able to do historically. And there's several other examples I can point to across all of the divisions that we're working on to better provide the opportunity to get our passengers to where they want to be much quicker than what we have historically.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg online.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, the question about exploring opportunities in the used aircraft market, where do you see a need? Is it -- are you looking at widebodies, narrowbodies? What's behind that?","John D. Rainey","It's on the narrowbody side. We are making some investments in our fleet on the widebody side to prolong the life of those planes. But this is more about being disciplined and balanced with respect to CapEx. And as we shift from relying less on the 50-seat RJs and more on the regional fleet, we need to do that in a financially disciplined way. I'm a big believer in the new aircraft that the manufacturers are putting out, but there's a limit to what we should go out and spend, and we need to be balanced with our capital, balanced with the amount of debt we're putting on and actually do this in a way that enables us to return cash to shareholders.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then just my second question, and this is -- it's probably a question for Jim. I think there was -- it was an article in some of the -- it seemed like some of the papers picked it up not that long ago about maybe United should shut down its Dulles hub. And I guess the question is, as I recall -- I don't know, this wasn't even that long ago, I recall hearing where, I believe, the DC and Northern Virginia area had one of United's highest concentrations of 1K and Global Service members, and some of the average one-way fares out of Dulles, at least on mainline, were among some of the highest in its system. And I don't know if that's changed. Maybe that has changed with the merger and the integration. But historically, I actually thought that, that was a very profitable operation for United. I realize you don't get into profitability of hub-by-hub economics, but is there anything that you can say to, I don't know, refute that or just give us some color?","James E. Compton","Mike, this is Jim. I think my comments would be that we have, as I talked about, our revenue initiatives and the 3 areas that we're focused on: network and schedule, the regional operations and revenue management. Within network and schedule, we're very focused on how our traffic flows across all our hubs, and how each hub participates into the overall network performance. Within that, the team -- very granular analysis, and the granular analysis includes many of the things that you just mentioned in terms of where our most loyal customers are, the lifetime spend and our expectations with that going forward. So I think I would just summarize by saying that we are very much focused on revenue initiatives that we've implemented, that we're going to implement, and those that we're researching, and that includes the overall look at the network.","Operator","From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie on line.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Jim, I guess, if I could just follow-up on Mike's question. I think one of the comments I heard is that each hub, pardon me, has to earn its way into the network and sort of alluded to the fact that maybe more decisions could be on the way. I know you're not willing to make any announcements today as, of course, these are long-term strategic decisions you have to live with. But I wonder if you can provide some perspective about when you might expect to reach a decision first? And I guess secondly, from where you sit today, does any potentially required surgery seem extensive or perhaps more modest?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Dan, this is Jeff. Let me take that question if I could. I would say that nothing is off the table, and we'll take the actions that we need take to maximize the value of our enterprise for our shareholders. We have demonstrated an ability and willingness to take tough actions. Cleveland's a good example of that. We have a lot of initiatives underway, and we're taking a lot -- a look at a lot of others. I'm not going to put a timeframe on that, nor will I talk about, nor will we as a company talk about directionally where we'll go until we're ready to talk about something. But I want to assure you that this team is committed to improving our margin performance, to improving our value for our shareholders, to improving our product, to improving our operational reliability, and we will take whatever actions are necessary to do just that.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Understood, I appreciate that. And then I guess just -- if I could follow up with one more question on the capital return. I appreciate the perspective you guys have already shared. And I guess, just going back to the original goal, it was initially to return it in 2015. And so, I'm wondering if you can -- and maybe you've already shared this, but provide some more perspective on what led you to conclude that it made sense to bump it up by 1 year. So I guess, in particular, is it really just the intrinsic value of the stock? Or is there a view, perhaps, that the core business is on track to recover more quickly than you previously anticipated?","John D. Rainey","Well, it's absolutely both those, Dan. I would emphasize that when we first articulated our plan to return cash to shareholders last fall, we were deliberately vague with the timeframe, and we said by sometime in 2015. And at that point, we were very early on in several of the key initiatives that we're working on right now. We now have a few quarters underneath our belt, and you can see the results of those performance in our financial and cost performance this morning. We have a clear line of sight into the cash flows that exist out into the timeframe that we talked about and we've got a lot of confidence in our plan, and that's what this action today reflects.","Operator","From Evercore Partners, we have Duane Pfennigwerth online.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Jim, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about rebanking, specifically. I don't know if it was just Chicago or a number of hubs. When we look at your connecting RASM, it actually appears pretty good. It's running ahead of your existing primary competitor. So it looks like, philosophically, you already appreciate the value of connecting revenue. Can you talk about what's actually changing and what revenue you feel like you're leaving on the table and maybe how large this opportunity is?","James E. Compton","Yes. The opportunity is, obviously, to improve that. The -- and what we're focusing on is, beginning in the fourth quarter in Denver and beginning in Houston towards the end of the year and into the first part of the year, and then Chicago by spring of 2015, looking at rebanking those 3 hubs. What it will do is it makes -- what it does is it reduces the connection time, and the opportunity to drive more connections at a higher yield than what you're already seeing today. So yes, we do really well in the connecting business today, but we think it's an opportunity to drive it even higher as we tighten those things up and driving more connecting opportunities for our customers.","Jeffery A. Smisek","And also, the one thing I would add, Duane, is that as we have had a lot of focus on improving our operations, we have more confidence in our operational reliability going forward to permit those connections to occur without undue misconnects.","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joe DeNardi online.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Jim, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about on the commentary you provided on the Pacific, maybe quantify or put into context kind of how the initiatives that you've put into place on that market should help alleviate some of the capacity growth that you're seeing kind of going into fourth quarter, maybe on a year-over-year basis.","James E. Compton","Joe, yes, the Pacific performed better than our expectation in the second quarter, so we're pleased with the progress that we're making on our Pacific initiative. But it kind of falls -- it falls into 4 categories. Restructuring our Narita flying, working with our ANA -- with our JV partner, ANA, to do that. Which means, for instance, in March 2014, we no -- we suspended flying Narita to Bangkok and are now connecting that traffic that we carry over the trans-Pacific, over ANA, to Bangkok. The tech ops team, the maintenance team invested in a great program in the reliability of 747. Last year, we talked about that. The second quarter was the beginning of the repositioning of those 747s, and allowing those airplanes to fly the missions that, from a network perspective, from a revenue perspective, they want to fly. That has a lot -- in addition, our secondary Asian city strategy really is exceeding our expectations in new routes from San Fran to Taipei and Chengdu are exceeding our expectations, is that third prong of the strategy. And then the last one is rightsizing the missions with the 787. We used to fly San Francisco to Osaka on a larger airplane, it's now on the 787 and the economics are significantly better, as an example of the flexibility of our fleet that we have as we take deliveries of 787s to optimize the network going forward. So in the context of the competitive pressure that you talked about, we're actually -- we're building on the great footprint we have in the Pacific, and the uniqueness that we can bring to the market allows us to manage against that pressure that we see as the capacity, particularly into China, accelerates through the rest of this year.","Operator","And from Raymond James, we have Savi Syth online.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask about what you're seeing in the Latin America region. It looks like your capacity has been increasing, but it's seen a bit of recovery and maybe not similar to what we have seen elsewhere. And I'm just wondering if what you're seeing? And maybe, where the growth is being concentrated?","James E. Compton","And we are seeing increase in Latin -- in our investor update we actually talked about over the next several weeks, we're booked up about 4.5 points in the Latin America division. And so we're confident with our capacity growth in the market. We're seeing strong growth looking forward in the leisure beach destinations, as well as into Mexico -- the business markets. And I will tell you that a lot is driven by the Houston hub. It's a great connecting point, it's a great facility as a gateway into Latin America. So as we -- again, as we face competitive pressures, we'll monitor what's happening in the marketplace and make sure that we keep capacity in line with the demand. But we're really confident where we're at and the results that we're seeing in Latin America right now.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just as you look across your hubs, I was just wondering, we've seen a lot more of Frontier adding a lot of capacity into more of your markets. And I know that's a very different product, but I -- just wondering what the impact has been and what your response has been.","James E. Compton","Obviously, we compete amidst many carriers across our system. And we think that we have a terrific product, it is a different product than the ultra-low-cost carrier product. And we view that as we build our operational reliability, as we improve on the predictability of product that we have in the marketplace, we're well-positioned to compete, really, against anybody, including Frontier.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions] From The Street, we have Ted Reed.","Ted Reed","I have 2 questions, one's easy and one's hard. The easy one is about Chengdu. You said the flights are doing well. I'd like you to say a little more about that, and the reason for it and might you increase frequencies. And secondly, to Jeff, there's been a lot of complaints a couple of months ago about -- from the pilots. I haven't heard you address that. But have you been listening to that, consulting with them? Does that explain any of the improvement?","James E. Compton","Ted, this is Jim. The first question on Chengdu. Relative to our expectation, what we're really pleased with is the point of sale out of China exceeding our expectations. And so that's where we've seen most of the upside versus what our initial forecast said. So we're looking forward to that continuing. We work really closely with the officials in Chengdu and have developed great relationships, and we're seeing the fruit of that bear out. But again, like any route, we'll monitor capacity and demand. And if the demand is there to warrant increase in frequency, we clearly have the opportunity again. And I'll go back to the 787, it's really a terrific airplane that allows us to do many things in the Pacific and across our network. So we'll continue, like we do in every market, monitor the capacity and demand and react to that appropriately.","Ted Reed","This must give you a lot of faith that you can continue to do great things with the 787 in China, open more cities.","James E. Compton","That's exactly right. I mean, China is a market that -- is an economy that continues to grow at a very strong pace. And there are many opportunities in China that you can develop markets with, particularly with that 787.","Jeffery A. Smisek","And Ted, this is Jeff. In answer to your second question, certainly, at the beginning of the year, with moving everybody to a single crew management system and FAR 117, the new flight duty time, we had some hiccups in some of those implementation, which adversely affected some of our pilots. But we've certainly also allow [ph] an enormous amount of focus to that. All our folks in ops and our technology worked together hard to make sure to make their lives more predictable and reliable. And certainly, the amount of focus we've had and investments we've had in improving our operational reliability makes the pilots' lives better, makes the flight attendants' lives better, makes our passengers' lives better. I think we have a good relationship with ALPA, in the joint collective bargaining agreement. We are in close consultations with our pilots on many matters. And we continue to develop that relationship, and we expect that relationship will continue to improve over time. We want to make sure that we have the right culture with everybody at this company, including our pilots, and I think we're making good progress.","Operator","We have time for one more question. From The Associated Press, we have David Koenig on the line.","David Koenig","I wanted to ask about the Tel Aviv flights. And did you plan to resume those all along as soon as the FAA lifted the NOTAM? Or did you conduct your own assessment? And if it is the latter, can you please explain your decision, what went into it?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Sure. Well, first of all, the safety of our passengers and crews is paramount, and we don't fly missions that we don't have confidence are safe. We have consulted extensively with the U.S. government, as well as our own people on the ground in Tel Aviv, and that is -- and we believe it's safe to fly and that's why we're commencing -- recommencing our flights.","Irene E. Foxhall","Okay. With that, we're out of time, so we'll conclude. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. Please call Media Relations if you have any further questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining.

Foxhall","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey; and Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasury, Gerry Laderman. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which, Jim will review capacity and revenue results.","John will follow with a discussion of our cost structure, balance sheet and guidance. Jeff will make a few closing remarks and then we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We would appreciate if each of you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll turn it over to Sarah Murphy.","Sarah Murphy","Thank you, Nene. This morning, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Both are available on our website at ir.united.com. Let me point out that information in this morning's earnings release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings, United Airlines and Continental Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the table at the end of our earnings release, a copy of which is available on our website. Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers. These items are detailed in our earnings release. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, President and CEO of United.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Thanks, Nene and Sarah, and thank you all for joining us in our third quarter 2012 earnings call. Today, we reported net income of $520 million for the third quarter or $1.35 per diluted share, delivering a pre-tax margin of 5.3%. We achieved this result despite operational challenges and high jet fuel prices, and I want to thank my coworkers for working together to generate more than $0.5 billion of profit during one of the toughest quarters of our integration. I know it wasn't easy, but our recovery from a very tough summer exemplifies what makes United great: Our team working together to make our airline better for our customers.","This quarter, we focused on improving our operational performance and investing in our fleet, our products and the tools our coworkers use to do their jobs. While we didn't do a good job with our operations during June and July, we took substantial steps during the quarter to improve our performance.","On our second quarter earnings call, I told you that we were going to return to running a reliable airline by adjusting our airport staffing levels, returning to our historical standard for spare aircraft, increasing the number of maintenance hours and touch points for our aircraft and rolling out the first release of our new, faster and easier to use interface for SHARES, our passenger service system.","We did all that and we are now running a reliable airline again. In September, our domestic on-time arrival rate was 82%, exceeding our goal of 80% and triggering an on-time bonus for our coworkers. Between July and September, our mishandled baggage rate declined by more than 30% and our mainline completion factor improved by 1.5 points to 99.4%. In addition to improving operational statistics, our customer satisfaction scores have increased significantly since our operational difficulties this summer.","We made substantial progress with our integration during the third quarter and continue on the right path today. However, we recognize that some of our customers chose to fly other airlines during the summer when our operational performance degraded. Just like when your preferred road to work undergoes construction, you might choose to take a detour until the road gets repaired.","Well, the road is repaired. And with our operations back on track, our unmatched global network and our industry-leading product offering, we expect to earn back those customers who took a detour and we expect to attract new customers as well. I am confident that we are building the world's leading airline, the airline customers want to fly, investors want to invest in and coworkers want to work for.","One of our highlights this quarter was taking delivery of our first Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the first of 5 we expect to receive by the end of this year. We couldn't be more excited about the benefits this aircraft will bring to our customers and the airline. The Dreamliner offers fuel efficiency, noise reduction and a terrific onboard customer and coworker experience.","We're in the process of completing our FAA proving grounds and certification work and are pleased with the Dreamliner's early operating performance. We will fly our first revenue flight on November 4 from our Houston hub to our Chicago hub. In December, we'll begin flying our first 787s internationally on temporary routes, and in January, we'll place the aircraft on their first permanent routes, Los Angeles to Narita, and Houston to Lagos.","We continued investing in our onboard product this quarter. We recently completed installation of global satellite-based Wi-Fi on our first aircraft. We're undergoing final quality and acceptance testing and expect the aircraft will be up and flying with Wi-Fi in November. Our new Wi-fi won't be like the prior generation Wi-Fi that you find on our U.S. competitor's aircraft. Our Wi-Fi is modern, global and satellite based, and as a result, will offer speeds consistently faster than what's available in the market today. Because it is satellite based, our customers will be able to stay in touch virtually wherever they fly us around the globe, a key differentiator between us and our competitors.","In addition to investing in Wi-Fi with better technology than that of our peers, we're taking a different commercial approach to Wi-Fi as well. We own the hardware, purchase the bandwidth and importantly, own and control the portal that customers use to access the Internet in-flight. Ownership and control will allow us to develop a comprehensive and dynamic pricing model for Wi-Fi and onboard streaming video, grant complimentary access to sites of our choosing and establish a wide array of commercial agreements, increasing the long-term opportunities for and value of onboard Wi-Fi to United.","Since our mainline fleet is so large with about 700 aircraft, it will take us some time to install this industry-leading Wi-Fi product across our entire fleet, but we anticipate completing about 300 aircraft by the end of 2013.","We continue to invest in products that our customers value and are willing to pay for, including Economy Plus seating and international premium cabin flatbed seats. United has a history of leadership when it comes to innovative seating products. As of today, we've installed Economy Plus seating on 90% of our mainline fleet and we expect to complete our Economy Plus installation in early 2013.","We've installed more than 6,200 premium cabin flatbed seats on our international fleet. And by February of next year, every aircraft flying over the Atlantic will have flatbed seats in the premium cabin. Moreover, our entire long-haul international fleet worldwide will have flatbed seats next spring.","We are committed to investing in our coworkers and providing them the tools to give good customer service. As I mentioned earlier, we've recently launched a new interface for our SHARES system with 2 powerful and intuitive apps for our coworkers to use, one for checking in customers and their bags and one for managing departures at the gate. We have a number of additional releases and development. And by next year, we expect to have a fully integrated user interface for our lobby and gate agents that is fast, intuitive, modern and easy to learn and use.","This quarter, we reached an agreement in principle for a joint collective bargaining agreement with our pilots and are in the process of finalizing the tentative agreement. This will be our first joint collective bargaining agreement and we're eager to make similar progress with our other work groups. We are currently in expedited negotiations for joint collective bargaining agreements with the IAM, which represents our airport employees, reservation agents and stores employees, and with the Teamsters, who represent our maintenance technicians. We've also begun the joint collective bargaining process with the AFA, which represents our flight attendants. We want to bring our work groups together and pay our people competitively, while increasing our ability to respond to market conditions to ensure United can achieve long-term success, regardless of the economic environment.","We are making these and other investments in our fleet, our technology, our products and our people to provide a better customer experience on United and a better workplace for our coworkers, as we focus on generating sustained and sufficient profitability. This quarter, we announced a target of earning a 10% return on invested capital over the business cycle. While there may be periods during the cycle where we won't hit our target, the entire management team is committed to achieving this goal, and we're embedding return on invested capital in all of our important business decisions.","While our merger creates the platform for United to generate economic value over the business cycle, we recognize that our future lies beyond the merger. We have many projects in the works that will improve our customer service, add revenue, enhance efficiency, reduce costs and provide the returns our investors expect.","During the third quarter, we made progress in building the foundation for our future. Although we are focused on achieving much more, we earned a respectable profit despite high fuel prices and complex integration challenges. We had a tough summer. But we're back on track operationally and are again providing the reliable service our customers expect of us and that we want to deliver.","We have more work to do to secure United's leadership position and achieve our long-term financial goals, but I'm certain that my coworkers are up to the challenge.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim and John to go through the results in greater detail.","James E. Compton","Thanks, Jeff. I join Jeff in thanking our coworkers for their hard work during a challenging quarter and also want to thank our customers for choosing to fly United.","We continued our commitment to capacity discipline in the third quarter as we reduce consolidated capacity 1.4% year-over-year. Maintaining capacity discipline is core to achieving our goal of generating sustained and sufficient profitability, especially in an environment of sluggish economic growth and elevated jet fuel prices. And we will continue to be very disciplined in our capacity deployment.","United's third quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue decreased 1.3%, and mainline PRASM decreased 2% versus the same period in 2011. Consolidated yields were weaker year-over-year, down 1.2%.","We recognize that while the industry as a whole faces largely the same global economic challenges, some of our recent relative year-over-year PRASM underperformance is related to issues unique to United because of our merger integration.","Over the past 2 quarters, we converted major IT systems used by both our customers and our coworkers, and redeployed aircraft across our global network. These changes affected our customers, put a great deal of stress on our operation and our people, and our operational and financial performance suffered as a result.","As Jeff outlined, we are back on track with our operational results and much improved customer satisfaction scores. We expect to continue to run a reliable airline while offering our customers the products and services they want and are willing to pay for. As for our revenue results, we are not satisfied with our relative year-over-year PRASM performance, and we are working hard to return to our industry leadership position.","Third quarter domestic mainline PRASM decreased 4.2%, and yields decreased 2.6% versus last year. Domestic mainline capacity decreased 1.7% year-over-year. Regional PRASM increased 1.6% while regional capacity decreased 1.1% versus the third quarter of 2011.","Third quarter international unit revenue was flat versus the same period in 2011, and yields decreased a modest 0.7% year-over-year. International capacity decreased 1.1% versus the third quarter of 2011.","The Pacific was United's best-performing region in the third quarter, with unit revenue up 9.9% and yields up 7.2% versus the same period in 2011. Pacific capacity increased 1% year-over-year. China was the top-performing Pacific country with approximately 11% PRASM growth and 8% yield growth versus the third quarter of 2011.","Japan continued to perform very well in the third quarter as PRASM and yield increased 6% and 5%, respectively, on capacity growth of 8% year-over-year. We are excited to start flying our Dreamliners across the Pacific beginning in the first quarter of next year, with Los Angeles to Narita and Los Angeles to Shanghai followed by Denver to Narita. Our trans-Pacific network is unmatched with more nonstop routes between the U.S. and Asia than any other carrier in the world.","Third quarter trans-Atlantic PRASM decreased 4.5% and yields decreased 3.7% year-over-year. We reduced our trans-Atlantic capacity during the third quarter by 3.7% year-over-year. We've been affected by the economic challenges in Europe, and the majority of our previously announced fourth quarter capacity reduction is to our European service. One of the most important benefits of our merger is our ability to reduce capacity in weaker markets like the Atlantic and take advantage of stronger markets like the Pacific, as economic conditions change around the world.","Latin America again faced very challenging year-over-year comparisons this quarter. Last year, Latin America PRASM and yields increased more than 20% versus the third quarter of 2010. This year, Latin America third quarter PRASM declined 8.3% and yield declined 9.4% with a capacity increase of 1.6% year-over-year. On a year-over-2-year basis, however, third quarter Latin America PRASM and yield are up approximately 11% and 10%, respectively.","Third quarter cargo revenue declined 13% versus the same period last year. The cargo business continues to struggle because of increased industry cargo capacity and the impact of our aircraft redeployment, which changes the amount of cargo space available throughout our network.","Our ancillary revenue increased 1% year-over-year this quarter. As we reduced capacity and in turn have fewer employments, our checked bag and change fee revenues decreased. Counterbalancing that effect is other ancillary revenue. Seat upsell revenue, which includes Economy Plus and paid premium cabin upgrades grew more than 25% year-over-year. Economy Plus sales increased 20% this quarter, in part due to having more Economy Plus seats available on our subsidiary, Continental, aircraft and in part from leveraging our ability to dynamically price Economy Plus using SHARES.","Third quarter sales of paid premium upgrade, which is our product allowing customers to purchase access to the BusinessFirst or global first cabins, increased about 50% versus 2011. SHARES provides us a much more powerful platform to dynamically price Economy Plus, paid premium upgrade and other ancillary products. We know our customers value more space when they travel, and we're pleased to provide them with the seating options they want and are willing to pay for.","Corporate revenue increased modestly this quarter. And I'd like to take a moment to thank our corporate customers for their loyalty. Although some customers flew other carriers during the height of our operational challenge this summer, the vast majority of our global corporate account clients chose to stay with United. They had confidence in us, and we work hard to improve our reliability and deliver for them. Now with our better reliability, our unmatched route network and improving product offering, we are confident that United is the best airline for the global business customer.","In September, we expanded our aircraft redeployment effort across our domestic network, particularly at our hubs in Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, and are encouraged by the early results in a number of these markets. We are phasing in redeployment more gradually than we initially planned to ease some of the stress on our operation and now expect substantially to complete our redeployment effort in the first quarter of 2013.","Redeploying aircraft not only helps us improve financial performance on individual routes by better matching the right aircraft to demand, it also allows us to initiate new service to a number of destinations that neither subsidiary served prior to the merger. Since the closing of the merger 2 years ago, we've added more than 70 new routes across the globe while reducing consolidated capacity.","In part due to the slower than expected redeployment rollout, our revenue synergy realization has been slower than we initially targeted. Now that we restored our operational performance to expected levels, we're confident that revenue synergies will accelerate in 2013. And we remain confident that we will achieve the full $800 million to $900 million of run rate annual revenue synergies we identified at the beginning of our merger.","Based on the latest GDP revisions and global economic conditions, we expect some softening of the economy during the remainder of 2012. And the strength of any recovery in 2013 remains unclear. As a result of this uncertainty, last month, we announced a reduction to our expected remaining 2012 consolidated capacity. We now expect fourth quarter 2012 consolidated capacity to decrease between 2.2% and 3.2%, and our full year consolidated capacity to decrease between 1% and 1.2% year-over-year.","In September, we also announced a reduction to our 2013 capacity plan. We now expect our full year 2013 consolidated capacity to be down about 1%. Appropriately matching supply and demand is critical in achieving our long-term return target of 10% on our invested capital, and we are committed to maintaining capacity discipline to help us achieve our goal.","Turning to our near-term revenue outlook. We currently estimate United's October consolidated PRASM will be roughly flat year-over-year. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Rainey","Thank you, Jim. Today, we reported net income of $520 million and a pre-tax margin of 5.3%. I want to thank the entire United team for their effort and contribution to our results this quarter. An integration of our size and complexity takes considerable time and creates a lot of change for our customers and for our coworkers. That said, we are starting to see many improvements from our merger: a new narrowbody aircraft order, service to new markets, industry-leading Wi-Fi and a new, modern user interface for our SHARES system.","During the quarter, I announced United's long-term return on invested capital target of 10% over the business cycle. 10% is the right starting threshold for us, as it's above our cost of capital and is a return level we have not consistently achieved at any point in our history. Our goal to create economic value runs throughout the organization. And while it is a challenging goal, we are focused on achieving it by working together.","Since closing our merger 2 years ago, our return on invested capital has been 10.2%. For the 12 months ended September 30, however, our return on invested capital was 9.3%. We are not satisfied with the recent compression of our financial performance and we are taking action to improve it.","Moreover, the composition of our shareholders, the owners of our company, has changed over time. Many of our owners today have invested in our stock because they recognize the transformation taking place in this industry and the potential for value creation that exists uniquely at United. They expect us to earn our cost of capital and for us to manage the business accordingly. We are identifying opportunities to improve our cost structure by sourcing services from the best providers, operating more efficiently than we do today, investing in technology that gives our customers more control over their travel experience and resizing our footprint for the airline we are today and will be tomorrow.","Third quarter total operating expense increased 0.9% or $79 million year-over-year. Fuel costs increased 1% this quarter and accounted for nearly half of the year-over-year increase in operating expense. Cost control and efficiency are essential to our long-term success, and our third quarter performance reflects our efforts in this area. We are becoming less reliant on manual processes and finding new ways to increase revenue and reduce cost through technology and doing it in a way that provides higher customer satisfaction while making the day-to-day work for employees more gratifying and productive.","Third quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, increased 3% versus 2011 on 1.4% less capacity. On a fuel rate and profit-sharing neutral basis, third quarter consolidated unit cost increased 2.5% year-over-year. The impact of cost synergies can be seen in our CASM performance this quarter. Some examples include facility consolidation and harmonization of engine and component maintenance programs. While we have captured cost synergies faster than we originally expected, we do anticipate a number of headwinds, including the cost of joint collective bargaining agreements that will put some pressure on our unit cost next year.","We effectively managed cost this quarter while making prudent investments in our business with an eye for improving our customers' experience. In addition to installing Economy Plus, flatbed seats and satellite Wi-Fi, we are adding larger overhead bins on our Airbus aircraft, improving the food, beverages and amenities in our international premium cabins and building a new United Club and adding jet bridges at Chicago O'Hare's Terminal 2. We will make the right long-term investments for our business that will deliver benefits to our customers, coworkers and the bottom line.","We continue to make progress in strengthening our balance sheet in the third quarter, making $487 million of debt and capital lease payments, including $104 million of prepayments. This quarter, we paid off our 2 most expensive pieces of debt totaling $251 million with an average interest rate of over 12%.","At the end of the third quarter, our net debt totaled $12.5 billion or $16.7 billion, including our pension liability. Our unencumbered asset base at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.7 billion.","In September, we issued a EETC with $844 million of proceeds. This transaction will finance 21 aircraft in total: 3 787 Dreamliners and 18 737-900ERs, which will be delivered between this November and July of next year. The A tranche of this EETC priced at a 4% fixed coupon and the B tranche priced at 5.5%, resulting in a blended coupon of 4.16%, the lowest rate in history for an issuance of this kind.","While we are focused on reducing our net debt balance, financing aircraft through capital markets remains a prudent and cost effective use of debt. We ended the third quarter with $7.2 billion in unrestricted liquidity, including an undrawn credit facility of $500 million. In the 2 years since closing the merger, we have strengthened our balance sheet considerably, making $4.6 billion of debt and capital lease payments, maintaining a strong liquidity position, including the addition of a revolving credit facility and increasing our unencumbered asset base by $1.7 billion.","We still have a significant amount of debt maturities and capital lease obligations over the next few years. And while we would like to pay off all the instruments as they come due without refinancing, we will make the right decisions for the business based upon the economic environment at that time.","Gross capital expenditures were $412 million in the third quarter, and net capital expenditures were $222 million. We are reducing our fourth quarter capital spending from previous expectations and now project full year gross capital expenditures to be $2.25 billion or $1.15 billion net of expected financing.","During the third quarter, we took delivery of 3 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft and the first of our 787 Dreamliners. We removed 3 Boeing 737 Classics and 1 Boeing 757 from service during the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of 4 more Dreamliners and 6 Boeing 737-900ERs. We expect to end the year with 3 fewer mainline aircraft than we started with the total of 698 aircraft.","We expect our full year 2012 consolidated unit cost, excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, to increase 2.7% to 2.9% year-over-year. Notably, we have modestly lowered our full year cost guidance, even while twice reducing our expected 2012 consolidated capacity. We expect our fourth quarter 2012 consolidated unit cost, again excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, to be up 3.5% to 4.5% year-over-year. Our third-party business expense was approximately $55 million in the third quarter and is projected to be $250 million for the full year.","In closing, we made over $0.5 billion of profit in the third quarter with good cost control and a stronger balance sheet, yet our performance fell short of our expectations. We've laid much of the -- we've laid much of the foundation for our future to recognize that we still have a significant amount of work ahead to realize our potential. United has the very best assets in the business, the best network for customers, a strong pipeline of new products and services, efficient aircraft and professional employees dedicated to our customers, from which we will build the world's leading airline that creates economic value over the business cycle.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Thanks, John. Our merger has resulted in a lot of change for our customers and our coworkers, and I know that the road has been a tough one. However, we are laying the foundation for the world's leading airline. Many of the investments we've been talking about will become visible to our customers and our coworkers in 2013, and we are very excited about delivering the airline our customers want to fly, our investors want to invest in and our coworkers want to work for.","I'll now turn it over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.","Sarah Murphy","Thank you, Jeff. First, we'll take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brendan, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A question for Jeff or, I don't know, maybe Mike Bonds, if he's there. It does appear that you're making substantial progress on a pilot contract. Most of the language coming out of the pilots suggest that terms are largely in line with the new Delta deal. But what's unique about the Delta contract is that there are some Delta-specific offsets to what otherwise appears to be an expensive contract, a decline in 50 seaters, subleasing the 717s, more large RJs and so forth. So I'm not asking you to comment on where your wage rates ultimately settle out. I can make my own assumptions. But can you give us some color as to potential United offsets that might benefit you? I mean, you're not looking for 717s. You already have a lot of RJs. What can you pick up to potentially offset a several hundred million dollar dyssynergy?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Hey, Jamie, this is Jeff. Listen, we're subject to a gag order from the NMB, so I can't comment on it. I think that the terms of the contract will be, in their entirety, will be coming out relatively soon. I will tell you, though, that we believe this is a very competitive contract for us.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, competitive in what sense? I mean, the NMB doesn't gag you, Jeff, with all due respect, from throwing out a wish list of items that you would like to have.","Jeffery A. Smisek","No, I'm not -- Jamie, I'm just not going to go there. We're not -- I'm not -- there's no reason for us to get on the wrong side of NMB right now, and we're not going to do that.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so it comes down to trust us. All right, I'll try to live with that.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg online.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","John, I want to go back to the CapEx number. You talked about that number coming down. What was that number previously? And I do see in the fourth quarter, it does look like that -- some of the net purchase deposits, it looks like they're either being refunded. Is that -- what's that tied to? Have you pushed back some aircraft deliveries? Can you just -- can you run through that?","John D. Rainey","You're right. And we did have a swing in purchase deposits in the third quarter. We had almost $200 million there. That's just tied to the timing of aircraft deliveries. In total, I would say that we recognize in advance that this year was a bit of a bow wave with respect to capital spending for us. You'll see some of that bleed into next year. But we certainly want to get back to a more normalized level of capital spending over time.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, good. And then just my second question. I did see that it looks like in the fourth schedule, you're adding some service to some -- it looks like additional service to Heathrow, at least I think it's incremental out of Dulles and Houston, or maybe it's reallocating some other flights. If it is incremental, are those -- are the slots for that -- are those slots -- have you purchased those slots like you have in the past? Or are those slots being leased, if it is incremental?","James E. Compton","Mike, in terms of -- in Heathrow, it would -- what -- I guess I'm trying to zero in on what period you're thinking about or are looking at.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I think it's in the spring, where you're adding another flight from Houston to Heathrow and another flight from Dulles to Heathrow.","James E. Compton","Yes, so the -- what we have in there incrementally is a third trip on Houston to Heathrow at that time period as we put 3 767s into the market.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Is that an incremental slot? I guess -- because in the past, you purchased slots, and slots typically come...","James E. Compton","Yes, it's an incremental slot that we've been able to hold on to.","Operator","From Dahlman Rose, we have Helane Becker online.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of points of clarification with respect to -- I think you said on the pilot that you were in negotiations or finalizing language. Do you have a timetable of when that's done?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Helane, this is Jeff. Yes, we're finishing up the wording on the tentative agreement, and we anticipate that the tentative agreement to be out quite soon.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on average fare for the mainline. It's kind of like flattish year-on-year. I mean, are you seeing evidence that you can push that higher looking out to fourth quarter and next year?","James E. Compton","Hey, Helane, this is Jim. Obviously, we can't comment on future pricing. Although last week, we did increase domestic fares $2, $3, $5 one way that, ultimately, at the end of the week, the industry matched. So we're always looking at the demand capacity and how that's -- and then pricing relative to kind of that demand capacity level in terms of where it sits.","Operator","From Wolfe Trahan, we have Hunter Keay online.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","A couple of questions for John, I believe. John, I appreciate the commentary about your shareholder base. I think that's right in terms of the people sort of waiting around for this transformation. So as your ROIC has started to lag little bit your target, why not give some thought to giving them some money to stick around? And by that, I mean, I understand the value of deleveraging the balance sheet. But if you look at just from an academic perspective, the fact that your cost of debt is about 1\/3 of your earnings yield and you have a lot of cash in your balance sheet to play with, why not think about maybe initiating a buyback with, say, 100 -- I mean, $1 billion or so? Because of the simple math that exists between rewarding equity holders and the accretion that should basically impact your EPS from the earnings yield versus the cost of debt, which is now, again, at this point, about 3x higher. Or is it more just let's get the balance sheet in order first before even thinking about returning cash to equity holders?","John D. Rainey","Well, Hunter, I think that, first of all, it is something that we think about. We need to get to a point in this business where we are directly returning cash to shareholders. I don't think we're there yet. If you look at the progress that we've made over the last 3 to 4 years, reducing our net debt balance, it's decreased by almost $4 billion. But as pure financial theory would suggest, our equity values probably should've gone up as well and they haven't, haven't for us and they haven't for the industry. And so that suggests that there's still some instability, at least the market believes that, in our capital structure today. So I think, in terms of prioritization, we need to continue to improve our balance sheet. We need to get rid of a lot of the debt that is the chain around our neck, that it's non-aircraft debt. And we've got a significant opportunity at United. We've got about $3.5 billion of debt maturities over the next few years that have nothing to do with financing aircraft. I think as we begin to improve and strengthen our balance sheet, and then I think you should see earnings multiples improve in this business. We  would have hoped we would have already seen it because we think we made significant progress. But once we take care of those things, I then think that you can have a more serious discussion about a share buyback or beginning to distribute a dividend.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. All right. And on fuel, without advocating for a policy, you look at US Airways and they're going to pay the cheapest for jet fuel per gallon, again, for anybody. I think that's like 4 over the last 8 quarters. At what point do you think that stops becoming a fluke? And at what point do you think that, that is a legitimate trend that has a merit, that's something worth considering? I mean, is there going to be a saying like, \"Okay, we need to look at -- we need to make sure this happens for 3 years, or we need to make sure this happens for 10 years.\" I mean, at what point does it stop becoming a fluke, if it continues to happen?","John D. Rainey","Well, first of all, let me say I agree with the underlying premise of your question. It would be great if we could get to a point, as an industry, where we could better pass along our cost inputs, particularly fuel being the single largest expense that we have. We're unlike some of the other industries that people are quick to compare us to in terms of rail and freight, in terms of how far out we sell tickets. And we're exposed to that fuel price volatility. I think hedging is one of those things where it's -- there's perfect visibility in hindsight. We had over $500 million of hedge gains last year. I think, if you're comparing to U.S. Airways, a couple of things I'd point out. One is that there are geographic differences with respect to where we buy fuel. We have 50% of our capacity that's international. We buy a lot of fuel on New York Harbor and on the LA, which is much more expensive than Gulf Coast jets. So on just a pure unhedged basis, we're always going to have a bit of a premium to them, but we would think that we would also get a revenue premium by serving those markets. But in terms of what we're doing from a hedging perspective, we are thoughtful about this, and we recognize that, historically, we spent a couple of hundred million dollars a year in hedge premiums. And given what's happened to fuel more recently, we try to achieve the same amount of risk management but by spending less premium, and that's why you've seen our hedge policy or our actual instruments change a little bit over the last few years. But I think it's important for us to continue to protect against some of the short-term volatility. So absent the ability to pass along our fuel surcharge in the very immediate term, we're going to continue to hedge.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn online.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, as we look forward, I think one of the things that's sort of unique about United is how easy your comp is in December. Is the right framework to be thinking about the world and sort of holding macro constant and so on and so forth? Is the right framework here that as we lap that comp, there's going to be sort of a natural mathematical significant reacceleration in PRASM? Or are there some sort of noneconomic puts and takes that I should be thinking about in December?","James E. Compton","Hey, John, this is Jim. You're right. As we -- if you went back to the -- our first quarter earnings call, we talked about some of the issues that we faced in the first quarter and also in December, for instance, as we integrated 2 revenue management systems and we talked about some yield degradation in the month of December. So that, to your point, is clearly out there on a year-over-year basis. I would tell you that those systems have matured now, now that one source of data versus 2 systems beating the demand forecast and so forth. So that has matured and that is operating at a much higher level than what we were talking about in the first quarter. In terms of getting down to other specifically outperform -- I'm reluctant to talk about that. We recognize that we're not satisfied with our revenue performance in the third quarter, that we had dyssynergies. And quite frankly, we know that we're working really hard to get those synergies back. And so there's the timing. We're obviously very confident that we will, but that timing -- so it just makes it hard for me to comment on saying a specific timeline we would begin to outperform. But clearly, the things that you talked -- that you mentioned and I just talked about happened in December and the first quarter.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And John, if I could ask a question about cash flow in 2013. In 2012, you had a number of sort of onetime items that were cash hits that kind of depressed the cash flow profile integration, some of this stuff recently announced with labor. As you look into 2013, it seems like some of these should roll off very naturally and create a pretty big tailwind for cash flow. Outside of the PBGC issue, am I on the right track? Or are there things in 2013 I should be on a lookout for?","John D. Rainey","I think you're absolutely on the right track. If you look at our initial guidance with respect to the onetime integration expenses, we've realized a lot of those already, and I think you would expect to see those wind down appreciably next year. That said, we still have to achieve some labor agreements and there are a few other blips out there. You mentioned the PBGC. No, but that's noncash. So I think in a directional sense year-over-year, definitely, you would see a stronger cash flow next year as it relates to some of the onetime items.","Operator","From Barclays, we have David Fintzen online.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a question for Jim. And I know there's obviously a lot of noise in the data in terms of your on-time performance and some of the systems integration. But I'm curious, as you're starting to put in some of these aircraft -- some of the moving aircraft around is sort of hitting the results, just curious, how do you think about the sort of spool of those benefits? I mean, is there -- is it pretty front-end loaded when you make these network changes? Or is there a time lag we should be thinking about to sort of get some history into the revenue management systems and really optimize the outcomes?","James E. Compton","I think the -- it depends on the case that we're talking about. Clearly, if you redeploy and you're putting capacity that's greater than what was in that market before, there's a little bit of a new market spool-up that is applied to that. So there is a timing issue to that. And it's different by every market, David. So it would be hard to kind of talk about it at that one point. On the other hand, obviously, we redeploy aircraft where the demand is not as great and we get the smaller aircraft on that route and the returns are immediate. So it's a little bit mix of both. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, we started to do a nice step-up in redeployment in the month of September. And at the same time, ran an 80% on time with the great work by the operations team in reliability. And so as we kind of -- although we've slowed down that pace of redeployment, as we continue to finish that up in the first quarter of 2013, we do expect those benefits would accelerate in 2013 under redeployment as we've now got the reliability back on track.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the redeployment side, if memory serves, it was -- it started more domestically oriented and that was going to shift more international into next year, is what I recall. I'm just curious, I would presume some of the international would be slowed down as well.","James E. Compton","Yes, that's somewhat although we've been doing both, quite frankly. Houston-Lima is a very early redeployment aircraft. New York to Buenos Aires -- we moved aircraft out of Dulles. And so -- but you're right. And then also, there's been a lot of domestic redeployments with the 737-900s and next-gen airplanes moving to the West Coast and getting on some longer haul markets. So it's a little bit mixed bag of both, but there will be more of both as we kind of accelerate in 2013.","Operator","From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie online.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","On the corporate travel book away that resulted from the operational difficulty, how much of that impact PRASM exactly in the third quarter? Or if you don't have that, how much are we really talking about? And I was getting pulled away from the call, so I apologize if you already gave that to us.","James E. Compton","We haven't put a dollar figure on that. Clearly, internally, we know where we expect to be from a revenue performance point of view. And so really, quite frankly, right now, is our sales force throughout the process and currently is working with our corporate partners, our business travelers to, one, talk about the value of the network in light of the new reliability and so forth. So there's a lot of moving pieces as we move to December. So it would be hard to put a specific number on exactly what that is. But clearly, it was a negative number for us in the third quarter.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And material, I guess, maybe that's the point. The fact that you're talking about it is...","James E. Compton","Yes.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Suggests that it's a pretty big number, at least, right?","James E. Compton","It was a significant number.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, fair enough. So I know you're not ready to comment a whole lot on 2013 capacity, but I am seeing seats for the first quarter down significantly more, down -- have been down the 1% that you folks are guiding to for the year. And I'm just wondering, since the data is public, I'm wondering if you can help us understand how first quarter capacity ties to the full year outlook and also just a little bit about the thought process behind that.","James E. Compton","Hey, Dan, as we've guided, the full year 2013, we're guiding toward 1% decline in capacity. As we move through the fourth quarter and into December, we'll give a lot more firmer guidance on that first quarter capacity. But at this point, we're guiding towards 1% decline and that's kind of where we're at for the full year and 2013 right now.","Operator","We have time for one last question and it comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Question on the operational improvement since July. How do you measure the underlying trend adjusted for changes in utilization? It seems like we've been in a less demanding utilization period here in September, October. So how do we think about the underlying trend as you prepare for a seasonally stronger period late this quarter?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Duane, this is Jeff. No, that's fair. I mean, it's -- it also depends on lots of sort of random events, as well as weather. But we're very focused on making sure that we can maintain our operational reliability during periods of more stress, holiday periods, certainly going into next summer as well. We continue to take actions to make sure that we are prepared for that and that we're prepared to continue to deliver on reliability.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up with respect to systems. I assume no airline is ever truly done with systems upgrades, but in terms of high-profile IT integration projects, what is left to be done? And can you give us a sense of timing?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Sure. We have a very big project that will come up in terms of integrating our aircraft maintenance systems. We're going to do that over -- on a fleet-by-fleet basis over a considerable period of time. It's a monumental project, and it's a multiyear project. We also have to integrate our HR systems as well and we have other systems that, as you said, they just continue on and on. So we'll continue to have it. None of those systems, however, has the high profile of our passenger service system, our SHARES system, which powers not only everything that the customer does, but our website and our loyalty program as well, which is a massive system, nor does any of those require the level of retraining that the SHARES system did. So my judgment, we're over the really tough hurdle of IT, but there's a considerable amount of IT. And I will tell you that putting the 2 maintenance systems together is going to take a considerable period of time, and it is a monumental task. But that can be staged on a fleet-by-fleet basis over a considerable period of time, that's a multiyear project.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Carey from Wall Street Journal.","Susan Carey","I'm not sure who might want to answer this question. Just wondering if you guys can walk me through the $454 million special item relating to the pilots' tentative. I'm just trying to understand what that is. Is that just like a date of signing lump sum payments? Because you're mentioning $250 million in late this year or in early '13 as a starter. So I'm just trying to understand what exactly this is.","John D. Rainey","Susan, this is John Rainey. As Jeff mentioned, we have a gag order imposed on us by the NMB, so I can't speak with a lot of specificity to this. What I can tell you is that it's, I would say, common in agreements like this to have an upfront payment. Some of that is contingent upon certain hurdles that will be achieved after the contract is signed. And we would expect the cash flows actually come towards year end and into next year.","Susan Carey","Depending on hurdles achieved by the company or by the pilots?","John D. Rainey","By the pilots, just in terms of getting the contract done and integrating.","Susan Carey","Okay. And can I just ask then, are we going to be seeing accruals for other unions in subsequent quarters?","John D. Rainey","To the extent that we think we're going to have a labor agreement, that will be -- and there's a cost, upfront cost to that, that will be built into our forward-looking guidance. But I will say, Susan, that this is a significant step forward for us. The pilots are a very visible group and they're a very important part of our airline. This is a group that's gone some period of time without getting a pay increase, and I think paying our labor groups competitively is important to our philosophy as a company. And we're actually pretty excited about the significant step forward.","Operator","And our last question comes from Josh Freed from the Associated Press.","Josh Freed","Can you say anything more about what your plans are for getting back travelers after the hiccups this summer? I mean, do you have sort of specific, targeted, I don't know, promotional-type things that you're planning to do? Or is it more sort of cross your fingers and hope that they're expected back by the things that you're obviously hoping to make  here [ph] and attract? Or do you have something that's really specific that you can call out, that you're hoping will sort of get you back on the good side?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Josh, I'll let Jim join in a minute. But I will tell you, no, it's not cross your fingers. We're being very active. We're making -- all of our sales people are deployed and making sure that our customers understand that our reliability is back. We're making sure they understand the product investments were making because we've been talking about product investments, but these product investments take time to put on all these aircraft and a lot of our customers will see that for the first time in 2013. And they'll notice significant improvements in our product offerings. We're doing all we can to get our customers back. We're having -- we've got dinners around the system with our global services customers. I mean, we're being very active to make sure our customers understand that United is back. We're back on track. We continue to invest, and we're the airline for them to fly. And I'll ask Jim to add anything he'd like to add.","James E. Compton","Josh, the only thing I would add to Jeff is that, one, obviously, we don't -- it's not about hope, as Jeff mentioned, it's about what we -- the network is actually the one sustainable differentiator we have versus our competitors because it is the best network. And so as Jeff mentioned, it's about communicating to our customers, both our high-level customers, our corporate customers, all those things are going on right now. But at the bottom of it is it's back to talking about the great value that this network brings to our customers, and that's the differentiator for us. That's sustainable. It can't be replicated and that's why we're very excited about where we're headed.","Josh Freed","Okay. I mean, did you end up having to offer any concessions on corporate pricing as a result of the trouble over the summer?","James E. Compton","We won't -- we don't comment on pricing, but the conversation's about the great value of the network.","Operator","We do have time for one more question from The Street, we have Ted Reed online.","Ted Reed","So I just want to clarify, the PRASM declines in every region are because massive numbers of passengers booked away to another airline because of the reliability, and now the reliability is back.","James E. Compton","Ted, this is Jim. That was one component of our RASM decline. There's yield pressures. There's competitive pressures. There's pricing pressure from competitors, all the standard things that are out there that can drive -- there's economic slowdown. There's high comps from last year. But clearly, what we want to do is focus on that piece of it that we consider revenue dyssynergy and work our way back. But there's a number of pieces that drive into what our performance would be year-over-year.","Ted Reed","Can I ask this? Do you think that the migration of passengers was so great that it benefited other carriers' RASM noticeably?","James E. Compton","I mean, I don't -- Ted, it would be hard for me to -- obviously, I don't see the other carriers' data and so forth. So what we're focused on is getting back to our leadership position in terms of RASM performance, and that's what we're really focused on right now.","Irene E. Foxhall","Okay, we're out of time.

Smisek","Thanks, Nene and Sarah, and thank you, all, for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings call. Today, we reported a full year profit of $1.1 billion, an 84% improvement year-over-year, or $2.84 per diluted share.","At the beginning of 2013, we outlined 3 goals for United: run a reliable airline, improve our customer service and achieve our return on invested capital goal of 10%. We achieved all 3 goals for 2013 and I'd like to thank our employees for working together to make that happen. We ran a reliable operation in 2013. We improved our on-time performance year-over-year in every quarter and achieved top-tier on-time performance among our peers in the fourth quarter. Our entire team worked together to minimize the customer impact of the severe winter weather we experienced in December and again this month.","We made tremendous progress on our customer service in 2013, including improving our customer satisfaction scores significantly. We continued to invest in our onboard product as well, outfitting our aircraft with the best seating options for our customers. We now have more than 35,000 Economy Plus seats installed in our airplanes and offer flat-bed seats on every long-haul international aircraft. We also began installing lighter-weight next-generation slimline economy seats on a number of our narrow-body and regional aircraft, providing a good product for our customers while improving our operating economics.","In addition to improving our seating options, we've also installed Wi-Fi on nearly 170 aircraft, added larger bins and refreshed the interiors on the majority of our 152 Airbus aircraft and installed in-seat power on more than half of our mainline fleet. We completely retrofitted the interiors of all of our p.s. aircraft, which fly between New York's Kennedy Airport and our hubs in San Francisco and Los Angeles.","We also recently launched our in-flight streaming video product, which will allow our customers to view a variety of on-demand entertainment options on their own devices.","We made a number of improvements at our airports as well. This year, we opened a new terminal at our hub in Houston, made significant enhancements to our hub in Newark and unveiled 3 new modern United clubs. We also began piloting new self-service technology, such as self-bag tagging and self-boarding gates and will roll out more of this efficient customer-pleasing technology this year.","During the second half of 2013, we released the first phase of our enhanced digital channels. We introduced new airport kiosk software that improves customer functionality and our ancillary revenue sales opportunities and launched an entirely new version of our industry-leading mobile app on iOS and Windows platforms. Customer feedback on our new app has been fantastic, and we'll roll out our new app on the Android platform this spring. We'll also be releasing our new united.com in phases this year.","For the 10th consecutive year, our MileagePlus program was named the Best Frequent-Flyer Program in the world by readers of Global Traveler.

And on January 1, MileagePlus launched new minimum levels of revenue to qualify for each Premier status level. Revenue tracking starts in 2014 for qualification in 2015 program year. Our members can now track their Premier qualifying dollars on united.com and our new mobile app.","In 2013, we invested in our employees, enhancing the tools they use to do their jobs such as Arrow [ph], the new intuitive front end of our airport system and provided new customer service training to more than 45,000 of our frontline employees.","Our customers are noticing the improvements we're making in our operations, product and service. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to climb and in the fourth quarter, they improved by 25% year-over-year, exceeding our goal.","We now have joint collective bargaining agreements with the majority of our representative employees and are working to reach competitive contracts with our remaining employee groups.","Our earnings growth improved throughout the year and our fourth quarter profit was our highest fourth quarter profit since merging. By working together, our team met our 10% return on invested capital goal for 2013.","2013 proved to be a pivotal year as we moved past integration and focused on building a strong foundation on which to grow. With the accomplishments of 2013 behind us, we've raised our goals for the quality of service we provide and the level of efficiency throughout our business for 2014 and beyond.","This year, we'll build on our employee service skills with our next phase of customer service training and new measurements of our service consistency. We will continue to install satellite-based Wi-Fi on our mainline aircraft at a rate of 1 aircraft per day. We'll also continue installation of our onboard streaming video on mainline aircraft that don't have seat-back in-flight entertainment.","Our customers will see the results of more investments at our airports this year as well. Tomorrow, we'll celebrate the opening of our ultra-modern Boarding Area E at our powerhouse West Coast hub in San Francisco. And later this month, we'll open a new global services lobby at Newark. In the second quarter, we'll move into our brand-new concourse B in Boston and the new terminal 2 at London Heathrow. Our customers will enjoy new United clubs in both Boston and London, and we'll continue to renovate other lounges across our global network as well.","We are also installing power poles or power bars in the gate areas at all of our domestic hubs this year as so many of our passengers are now traveling with personal devices that they like to charge up before or between flights. Later this year, we'll begin a major multiyear renovation at our Los Angeles terminals which will improve our customers' experience and make our operations more efficient.","We'll further improve our fleet by introducing 63 new highly efficient and customer-pleasing mainline and regional aircraft this year. These new aircraft will not only improve our customers' onboard experience and our reliability, but will also improve our fuel efficiency and, in turn, our bottom line.","We are also going to improve the quality of our processes and procedures with the goal of making United much more efficient. Now that we have solid operational performance and improving customer service, we're taking a careful look at each aspect of our business to improve the quality and efficiency of everything that we do. To that end, we've launched an internal program called project quality to identify and implement leading techniques and continuously improve the processes throughout our operations and management functions. As we outlined at our Investor Day last November, our goal is to reduce our annual cost by $2 billion and generate at least $700 million of additional annual ancillary revenue within 4 years and the dedicated project quality team will lead that multiyear effort.","In 2013, we worked hard to give our customers a reliable and flyer-friendly travel experience and to improve our financial results. This year, we'll continue to focus on operations, with the goal to be top tier in reliability. We will focus on deepening the level of customer satisfaction and aim to improve our customers' experience on United at every stage of their travel.","Finally, we'll continue to focus on expanding our earnings materially and exceeding a 10% return on invested capital. We have a lot of work ahead of us to deliver the financial results we are capable of, but I'm confident that we have the plans, the people and the focus to reach our long-term potential.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim and John to go through our full year and fourth quarter results in greater detail and the plans we have in place to grow our earnings in 2014.","James E. Compton","Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to take a moment and thank our employees for all they did to improve United's performance in 2013. We ran a good operation and delivered better customer service, both of which are critical for our customers and for our success. At United, we strive to be flyer-friendly by running a reliable operation and giving great customer service.","I'd also like to recognize the men and women on the front line, who managed through the extreme winter weather earlier this month. The storms and subzero temperatures that began on January 1 and lasted 7 days were among the worst weather events in our history and resulted in more than 6,300 canceled flights. Thank you for taking care of and re-accommodating our customers and taking care of each other during a very tough operational period.","2013 was a foundational year for United, and we made solid improvements in our operations and revenue results. We invested in our people, operations, customer service, technology, product and network. This year, we will continue to invest and we will further leverage our existing assets to improve the quality of our airline. We are already seeing early returns from many of our investments, but we have much more work to do to reach our full potential.","We ran a consistently reliable operation in 2013. We exceeded our goals for on-time performance in 6 months of the year. Our fourth quarter mainline on-time performance was 80.6%, which was top-tier among our peers. We recognized our employees' great work with $19 million in on-time incentive payouts for the 4th quarter and $54 million for the full year. We are also improving our customers' experience by reducing controllable delays and cancellations. For example, in the fourth quarter, we reduced maintenance cancellations by 14% year-over-year.","In 2014, we are focused on running a highly reliable, yet much more efficient operation. Our goal is to deliver top-tier reliability for our customers, while improving the processes and procedures that we used throughout our operations. We are modernizing airport infrastructure to better accommodate today's traveler, enhancing the tools our employees use and, more appropriately, matching staffing with workload throughout the operation.","For the full year, our consolidated capacity declined 1.4% year-over-year. 2013 was the third year in a row where we reduced capacity. Let me assure you that we will continue to be disciplined in how and where we deploy capacity. Over the next 4 years, we expect our consolidated capacity to grow less than GDP. In 2014, we expect our capacity to increase between 1% and 2% year-over-year. And this new capacity will be highly efficient. Our modest capacity growth will come from replacing older aircraft with new, fuel-efficient and larger gauge aircraft and by adding slimmer, next-generation economy seats.","Our global network breadth will grow as we add new service in 2014, making United even more flyer-friendly. We will enhance our leading route network in 2014 by adding nonstop service on international long-haul routes such as San Francisco to Chengdu and Taipei, Houston to Munich, Chicago to Edinburgh and Washington to Madrid.","San Francisco is the continent's premier West Coast gateway to Asia. This year, we will serve 8 Asian destinations nonstop and provide one-stop connectivity from over 80 cities to Asia.","Our new Boarding Area E in San Francisco will be customer-friendly in every sense of the word. It will offer an up-close view of the airfield and the Bay Area from a 23 foot-high window wall, state-of-the-art workstations, healthy and local food offerings and enhanced seating options.","Our 2 new nonstop flights from San Francisco to Chengdu and Taipei are good examples of the second phase of our Pacific network strategy. First, we built the best trans-Pacific network by flying to the most cities in Asia with the most nonstop flights of any U.S. carrier. We've launched those nonstop flights out of business-centric hubs like San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Washington, D.C. Now we are beginning to introduce nonstop service to secondary cities in Asia, making travel even more convenient for our business and leisure customers alike.","We expect first quarter 2014 consolidated capacity will increase between 0.3% and 1.3%. The severe weather -- the severe winter storms in January reduced first quarter capacity by approximately 0.6 points, and this impact is included in our current guidance.","It is important to note that this year, the industry will face operational challenges due to FAR 117 and the new 1,500-minimum-flight-hour rule for new pilots. FAR 117 is the FAA's new regulation regarding flight time and duty rules for pilots. This new regulation decreases the utilization of pilots and hour flexibility in managing irregular operations.","Our flight operations and network operations teams are working together to reduce the potential impact on our customers by adding buffer to crew schedules, enhancing tools to monitor schedules and hiring additional pilots. We expect that the combination of these new regulations will have a disproportionately greater impact on our regional partners, as mainline carriers hire regional carrier pilots due to the decreased productivity required by FAR 117. We are working to adjust our planned schedules to compensate.","Shifting to our revenue results. Our fourth quarter consolidated PRASM increased 3.2% year-over-year. Our revenue results improved throughout the quarter, particularly as we captured strong traffic and generated high yields during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods. Part of this strong performance is due to flexing our capacity up more than 20% on the peak days during these holiday periods and flexing down our capacity more than 40% on the off-peak days. We also coordinate closely with our joint venture partners on holiday schedules, providing more options for our customers while producing a better financial outcome for the JV.","Corporate revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter, continuing our 2013 trend of steady year-over-year improvements. As I explained on our last earnings call, during the fourth quarter, we implemented 2 significant recalibrations to our demand forecast. These adjustments were made to shift the booking curve towards more close-in bookings and improve the yield mix. We are starting to see the intended results from our actions and expect our yield mix improvements to accelerate through the first half of the year.","We currently expect first quarter consolidated PRASM to be between flat and up 2% year-over-year. This includes a 0.4 point negative PRASM impact due to lost revenue from the severe storms in early January and approximately 1 point negative PRASM impact due to Easter shifting into April this year.","Ancillary revenue continued its strong growth in the fourth quarter, increasing 18% year-over-year, led by Economy Plus sales, which increased 31%. On a per-seat basis, Economy Plus revenue increased 36% as we leveraged our pricing tools to better adjust our pricing based on the demand forecast. At our Investor Day in November, we outlined a goal of exceeding $3.5 billion in annual ancillary revenue by 2017. We're positioned well to achieve this goal as we generated $2.8 billion from ancillary revenue in 2013 and expect to grow this by approximately 8% in 2014.","We also fine-tuned our ability to provide our customers with an ancillary product offers most relevant to them based on factors such as customer and trip attributes. We saw increased ticket penetration through our direct digital channels in the fourth quarter, in part due to the enhanced functionality introduced throughout 2013. We've received excellent customer feedback on our new app and it is already having a positive impact on ancillary revenue. Ancillary sales via the app nearly doubled in the fourth quarter versus 2012. We're excited to roll out the first phase of our new website in the second quarter, which will provide improved ancillary opportunities, a better customer experience and lower distribution cost.","We are also increasing our customers' access to ancillary products by distributing the content in the channel where some of our most valuable customers shop. We expect to begin offering our Economy Plus product through all 3 major GDS providers in the first half of 2014. This will allow our travel management company partners to fulfill Economy Plus transactions through their normal processes. Importantly, we'll be able to utilize the same dynamic pricing and offer the same rich information through the GDS providers as we do on united.com.","We made good progress in 2013 and ended the year stronger. We have now shifted our focus to being an even more flyer-friendly airline for our customers in 2014 and beyond. United has an unmatched portfolio of assets, great employees, an unrivaled global network, an excellent fleet of aircraft and a customer-pleasing product offering. This year, we are excited by our opportunities to leverage these superb assets to satisfy our customers, drive efficiencies in our operation and improve the quality of our revenue results. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Rainey","Thanks, Jim. I also want to thank our employees for their great work in 2013. Due to their efforts, we made substantial improvements in our operational reliability and service that we deliver for our customers.","Today, we reported $1.1 billion of net income for 2013, generating a pretax margin of 2.8% for the year and a return on invested capital of 10%. We made significant progress in 2013 in building the foundation for sustainable profits in excess of our cost of capital. We invested further in our people, product, technology and fleet. We strengthened our balance sheet and we laid the groundwork to become much more efficient in 2014 and beyond.","For the fourth quarter and full year 2013, our consolidated operating expenses increased 2.3% and 2%, respectively. Fourth quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, increased only 0.6% year-over-year. For the full year 2013, our consolidated CASM, again, excluding fuel and third party business experience and profit-sharing, increased 6.3% year-over-year on 1.4% lower capacity. In each successive quarter in 2013, we slowed our year-over-year nonfuel CASM growth, an early sign of a cost discipline we're instilling throughout the business.","For the full year, our operating margin increased by 1 percentage point to 4.6% in 2013. Our fourth quarter operating margin improved by more than 4.5 points year-over-year to 4.3%, marking our best fourth quarter operating margin since 2010. While we made meaningful strides in performance as the year progressed, we are not yet even close to where we want to be. Our team is committed to increasing returns and reducing cost for the long term. As Jeff mentioned, we are focused on improving the efficiency and quality of everything we do through project quality. This effort is designed to make fundamental, permanent changes to the way we do business.","At our Investor Day in November, we outlined our plans to create sustainable long-term value for our investors while providing a great experience for our customers. In addition to the improvements we expect in passenger and ancillary revenue, we are implementing a $2 billion annual cost-saving initiative. These savings are comprised of $1 billion in annual fuel savings and $1 billion in annual nonfuel cost savings that we expect to achieve over the next 4 years.","We will make meaningful progress in this initiative in 2014, particularly in the areas of productivity, maintenance and fuel consumption. We expect productivity to improve approximately 3.5% in 2014 through improved tools for customers and employees, reduced overtime and modifying layouts and processes at our airports, among other initiatives.","In addition to achieving greater operational efficiency, in 2014, we also expect to have a cost tailwind related to pension and postretirement benefits. As interest rates have risen, we expect the discount rate used to calculate our liability to increase. We also modified these programs in the last year, which when combined with the increase in the discount rate and an updated experience study related to planned participation and retirement rates will reduce the expense associated with these 2 liabilities by over $100 million in 2014.","The actions we are taking to become more efficient and reduce our costs, combined with the impact of lower discount rates, will help offset some of the other inflationary pressures we face in 2014 such as escalations in labor contracts, increases in airport rents and landing fees and higher engine overhaul volumes.","We expect CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit-sharing to increase between 3.5% and 4.5% for the first quarter and between 1% and 2% for the full year.","The investments we're making in our fleet, product and technology are critical to achieving the cost savings we'd outlined and the returns our shareholders and management team expect. In 2013, we took delivery of 26 new highly efficient and customer-pleasing aircraft, consisting of 24 737-900ERs and 2 787 Dreamliners. We also retired 36 older, less-efficient aircraft in 2013.","We ended 2013 with 693 mainline aircrafts, 9 fewer than we started the year with. And over the long term, we intend to keep our mainline fleet size roughly flat at about 700 aircraft. To that end, in 2014, we expect to take delivery of 36 mainline aircraft, consisting of 30 737-900ERs and 6 787 Dreamliners, 2 of which will be the dash 9s.","We also expect to introduce 27 Embraer 175 regional aircraft. These 76-seat aircraft are far more fuel-efficient and provide a superior customer experience and ancillary revenue opportunity versus the 50-seat aircraft they'll be replacing.","We will also begin installing Split Scimitar Winglets on our 737-800 and 737-900ER aircraft in 2014, which will reduce fuel consumption by approximately 2% more on those aircraft.","By replacing older, less-efficient aircraft with more fuel-efficient planes, installing winglets and implementing operational initiatives to reduce fuel consumption, we expect our fuel efficiency to improve by approximately 1.5% in 2014. At today's prices, that equates to approximately $200 million in annual cost savings.","For 2014, we expect between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion of gross capital expenditures, including purchase deposits. In addition to new aircraft, which I mentioned earlier, much of the remaining 2014 capital spend is technology and customer-facing product investments. These investments will enable many of the efficiency improvements we've outlined, as well as provide a better experience for our customers.","In 2013, we made substantial progress improving our balance sheet, with $2.3 billion of debt and capital lease payments, of which approximately $400 million represented prepayments of debt maturing beyond 2013. Additionally, we redeemed approximately $240 million of convertible debt and ended the year with $6.1 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1 billion undrawn revolver.","We took a number of actions in 2013 to strengthen our balance sheet. We issued 2 tranches of unsecured debt, $300 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2018 with an interest rate of 6 3\/8% and $300 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2020, with an interest rate of 6%. Importantly, these benchmark transactions will allow us to opportunistically pay off higher coupon instruments such as the $400 million of 8% unsecured notes due in 2024, which we prepaid earlier this month. We continue to make good progress on our goal of reducing non-aircraft-related debt and using our balance sheet to efficiently fund investment in our business.","In addition to paying off the 8% notes, earlier this month we called for redemption of the remaining $156 million of the UAL 4.5% convertible notes due in 2021.","Our balance sheet improvements resulted in our 2013 interest expense declining by $52 million year-over-year. Excluding non-cash mark-to-market fuel gains and losses, we expect full year 2014 nonoperating expense of approximately $700 million.","Lastly, we continue to face headwinds from Washington increasing taxes and fees on air travel. Recently, Congress more than doubled the TSA security fee. For United alone, the net annual run rate impact from this increase is over $100 million. To make matters worse, a significant portion of the security fee increase will be used to pay for deficit-reduction rather than aviation security. There are now 16 different taxes and fees on air travel, representing a tax of approximately 21% on a typical domestic round-trip ticket, a rate that is higher than tobacco and alcohol, items which are taxed to discourage consumption.","Our government should not be discouraging air travel as it's a powerful economic engine that accounts for 5% of this country's GDP. Instead of increasing our federal tax burden, Washington should recognize the need for a national airline policy that promotes a successful U.S. airline industry and helps grow jobs in our nation's economy. Our industry is taking a number of substantive, self-help measures to fix itself, increase taxes and fees from our government and a lack of coherent national airline policy represent one of the most significant threats to the long-term success of this industry.","Despite the actions of Washington, we at United are eager to demonstrate our continued progress in 2014. Our financial priorities for 2014 are clear: significantly improve our efficiency, expand earnings and return on invested capital, make high return yet disciplined capital investments and further improve our balance sheet to reduce the risk in our business. We have a lot of work to do to achieve these results, but I'm confident that we have the right plan, the right people and the unwavering dedication to deliver for our employees, our customers and our investors.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery A. Smisek","While I'm pleased with our accomplishments in 2013, I and my management team are far from satisfied. We know that we can produce better operational and customer service results and far better financial results from the terrific people and assets at United. And we're very excited about 2014 and beyond. Our goal is to make United employee-friendly by being a great place to work, customer-friendly by offering top-tier reliability, a competitive product and consistently strong customer service and investor-friendly by delivering improved financial results. We are dedicated to doing just that.","I'll now turn it over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.","Sarah Murphy","Thank you, Jeff. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask their question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","John, question for you. So you got about $3 billion of CapEx scheduled, you got about $1.5 billion sized in debt maturities. That's $4.5 billion right there between the 2 of cash obligation. How much of that $4.5 billion -- you can talk directionally if you want. How much of that $4.5 billion is going to come from cash from operations or cash on hand versus new debt you're going to raise?","John D. Rainey","Hunter, we're optimistic about 2014 in what we can do in terms of operating cash flow. We've -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we issued 2 unsecured notes last year, each of $300 million, which in part are intended to provide a little bit more liquidity as we look at some of the refinancing opportunities that we have in the back half of the year and, specifically, I'm referring to the $800 million of notes that we can prepay beginning this September. And with respect to CapEx, the guidance that we've given of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion certainly puts pressure on free cash flow. But I want to emphasize that those are the right investments for our business. Those investments are going to enable us to achieve the returns that we expect over time.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Sure. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is there a scenario that you might possibly not raise debt this year?","John D. Rainey","Yes, there is a scenario, absolutely.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Great.","John D. Rainey","Hunter, other than aircraft debt.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. A question on the JV. You guys have a revenue share, Delta has a P&L share. I'm talking specifically on the trans-Atlantic A++. Lufthansa runs A380s on that route and I think that's a big CASM tailwind that they get but it's probably dilutive to yields because it's such a big plane. So I guess it's a 2-part question. One, has there been some talk of maybe down-gauging some of the A380s on Lufthansa's side? And, two, is there a possibility that you guys may shift to a full-scale P&L share as opposed just revenue share to maybe capture some of those unit cost savings from the 380s that they're running?","James E. Compton","Hunter, this is Jim. A couple of points. One is without specifically I will tell you that the network teams from both sides clearly talked in great detail about capacity and what's best for the JV, as well as delivering a great product for our customers. And I'll use an example of the holiday period, which is a great example, where, in the past, you might find both carriers canceling on the same day and then you look up and the next day both carriers are flying. Well, this year, with that coordination, what you do you is you work with each other to make sure that one cancels on one day, one flies and the other one -- and vice versa, all delivering a great product and things like that. So that's just an example that says how detail a level of conversations and how we manage that capacity and understanding what our partners' needs are and the challenges that they face as they try to place capacity around their network. As it relate, again, the second phase is that we're always working with our JV partners about how to improve the JV. And so, we, right now, think the revenue share model is the one that works for us. We actually think that within that we have a lot of work to do to again make the product much more transparent to our customers and drive results on that. So we're comfortable with where we're at. That being said, we're always discussing kind of what's the JV look like in the future.","Operator","From Evercore, we have Duane Pfennigwerth on line.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just in terms of your stronger margin improvement in the fourth quarter, of that 4 points, how much would you say is a result of nonrecurring accounting true ups and can you talk about was there any region in particular that drove that acceleration in margin improvement?","John D. Rainey","Duane, this is John. Very little of what I attribute to nonrecurring items within the quarter. There's obviously some lumpiness from one month to the next. But we're really pleased with how it closed out the year. We had -- we're pushing hard internally to achieve some of the goals and we had broad support from all the divisions. And I think it's an early indication of what we expect for 2014 and why we're pretty optimistic looking into the year. And as far as regional strength, Jim might want to chime in, domestic continues to be a pretty good balance between supply and demand as that was stronger, particularly in December. But other than that, nothing really stands out.","James E. Compton","Duane, I would add just a little detail. The team did an amazing job of managing the holiday period, both from a capacity side, as well as managing the yield and the mix. So just a terrific job that exceeded our expectations on the top line.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just a little detail. I may have missed it in the release. What was operating cash flow in the quarter?","John D. Rainey","Operating cash flow -- I don't have that. Let's see, it was -- for the fourth quarter, it was negative 3 34.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg on line.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just 2 here. On the pension piece, John, you talked about how the expense, you have a bit of a tailwind. At your Investor Day, I think at the end of the third quarter, the liability was $1.8 billion. Where was that liability at year end? How did that settle off?","John D. Rainey","Just our pension? It was around $4 billion of the -- just the liability. Obviously that's offset by the plan assets. So the net liability was a little more than $1.5 billion.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Nice, a few more hundred million of improvement from the third quarter.","John D. Rainey","Right. I'll just add that we also saw a fairly significant decline in our other postretirement benefit obligation as well.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Good. And then just my second question. When we look at the CASM guidance, we have a little bit of a bump up in the March quarter and then it looks like it moderates through the year and it looks like it's a bit of a repeat from a year ago. And I'm just curious, is that weather? Is that cost maybe associated with some of these employee buyouts or potential furloughs? What's driving that bump in the early part of the year?","John D. Rainey","Mike, I'd probably point to 3 things. One is we have a fairly significant escalation in one of our labor agreements at the beginning of this year that was hitting us in the first quarter. We also have more lumpiness than usual, and I'll give you an example of that with respect to some of our other cost items. Our maintenance expense, a significant portion of that is airframes. Well in the first half of the year, we're going to spend twice as much on airframes as we will in the back half of the year. And a lot of that is just driven by the timing of checks. But the third thing, and perhaps most importantly, is there's a ramp-up to a lot of the efficiency initiatives that we have in 2014. As you can appreciate, not all of those begin on January 1. But we're excited about the early returns there. I think our fourth quarter results give you some indication about the progress and we're optimistic for how that rolls out in 2014.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have John Godyn on line.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, I just wanted to follow up on the PRASM guidance. Just given the strong fourth quarter result versus your guidance, the optimism that we're hearing on the turnaround, your comments about accelerating improvement in yield mix, I can't help but wonder if some of the choppiness we experienced last year has caused the team to maybe add a bit more of a layer of conservatism to the PRASM guidance? Your thoughts?","James E. Compton","John, I think that's a fair assessment. As we look at our first quarter guidance, a little bit of color around it. As we guide to that flat to 2% up, last year, we ran a 5.9% RASM growth in the first quarter and far exceeded our peers in the industry on average. And so we are up against a little bit more difficult comps versus how we performed last year. The second piece is, as I mentioned, the weather impact of about 0.4 points of RASM to the downside to us. What we found is, in this weather event that was severe and of the 6,300 cancellation, a majority of those happened to be in Chicago. Normally, with a short weather event in a leisure period, you pretty much capture the traffic. But this is the time of year that we did recapture leisure traffic coming home from the holidays, but a lot of the business traffic that historically starts that first week of January heading out, particularly in Chicago, we didn't see the mix that we would have expected on a normal year given the severity of the weather. The third piece to our first quarter and maybe different from what other carriers are talking about, we actually see a point shift of RASM from March into April given the Easter effect and how our network operates within on that Easter so moving into the second quarter. And then the fourth piece maybe kind of tied to your comment, John. The team is really, really focused on the booking curve right now. I will tell you that on the revenue side, whether in it's any division, it's always about how do you better and how do you beat and so forth. But we are seeing the benefits of the mix change there and we do expect that to accelerate as we move through the first half of the year. So when you put it all back together, what we really see is terrific momentum coming off of the fourth quarter and a lot of excitement about 2014, but capturing some of those realities around the first quarter that leads to our guidance.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's really helpful. And John, if I could actually ask a question about costs. Some of the commentary that you gave on productivity improvements that are sort of being driven through the organization sounded pretty impressive. And when we think about the sort of walk in CASM x fuel throughout the year and where we are starting at in the first quarter and what the full year guidance looks like, I wonder, as we look towards the end of the year, could we actually be seeing flat to down CASM x fuel given the productivity improvements? Anything you can offer there?","John D. Rainey","Yes. I think that's a very reasonable assumption. As was mentioned in an earlier question, there's a lot more pressure in the first quarter. But we're pretty excited about the productivity improvements we're seeing. In the fourth quarter alone, we saw a 5.5% improvement in productivity with our labor forces. And as we continue to improve our operations, reduce our reliance on overtime, reduce call volume, things of that nature, we'll see those improvements bleed through into 2014. And you might remember, at our Investor Day, we talked about a multiyear goal of a 15% to 20% improvement and we are targeting a 3.5% improvement in 2014.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker on line.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, a follow-up to what you're saying just now about RASM. I certainly understand the point you're making about business travel getting off to a slow start in January because of the weather. But my view, which isn't necessarily correct, but my view nonetheless has always been that most business travel does get recaptured within a month or 2, perhaps not if you just missed the annual auto show, but if the role was to visit clients or do whatever one does for a living, you've still got to do that meeting in Chicago. Did you not incorporate any recapture in the guidance or did you incorporate that in the guidance? In other words, is it gone for good?","James E. Compton","Well, that's a great question, Jamie. I think what we do with our guidance is we take the information that we have at hand and try to make some assumptions to -- does business traffic that we would gone that first week of January or some portion of that start up later on in the quarter, I would agree with you, I think it does and so forth. And so it's a matter again to your point of what percent of that happens. We've tried to incorporate that in there. If that traffic is coming, it may or may not be seen in the yields that we see right now because it's still to be booked. But we clearly try to anticipate for that and our guidance kind of reflects our best look at what that data is saying right now.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. And a follow-up to the question that I actually touched on I believe last quarter, maybe it's the third quarter. But the New York market, Delta's indicated they hope to bring JFK up to a profit for this year. And it sounds like aircraft gauge and transcon flying are the driving factors for them as opposed to just a rising industry tide. I'm wondering how your Newark plan compares to this? I realize that hub is already profitable, but is the rate of improvement in Newark for 2014 consistent with your consolidated outlook or possibly the hub becomes a little bit less profitable as others improve their corporate share here in New York? Any updated thoughts on this topic?","James E. Compton","Jamie, so for us, New York is obviously a terrific profit center for us. It has been a while. We think that as we've talked about in the past, the advantage for us is that true connecting hub. So if something is changing in the local market, we have the ability to connect high-yield flow across that. But that being said, I'll point to our 7% corporate revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That was our strongest growth of any quarter during 2013. It gets back to why we're excited about the momentum as we head into 2014. So whether it's New York or across the system, we think that what we're seeing is great momentum across the system. I will add that in the transcon, we see some of our pressures, particularly in Newark, began last April with Virgin America's entry in [indiscernible]. And so, as we kind of manage and try to optimize revenue around that, we actually see upside as we go through the year as we lap some of that experience that happened in 2013. So we're very excited.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. If I could just quickly squeeze in something for John, just on the fuel efficiency. Based on the consumption guidance that you gave, it looks like ASM's per gallon will improve this year by about 1.7%. You indicated 1.5%. So it sounds like we're on the same page. But as we look at the 2015 fleet plan that you provided, should the rate of improvement slow or stay roughly the same?","John D. Rainey","Jamie, when we talk about the $1 billion in nonfuel cost savings, I've been asked this question quite a bit, most of that -- sorry, fuel cost savings -- most of that is through the efficiency of new planes. There are some operational initiatives that we have. But I think it's a fair assumption for your modeling perspective to assume that the savings are fairly ratable with our delivery of airplanes over that period of time.","Operator","From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker on line.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One, what is the amount of cash you have trapped in Venezuela? And have you been able to shift point of sale away from that market? What's your thought about that given today's devaluation?","John D. Rainey","Yes. It's a very topical question, Helane. We've got about $80 million of cash that's trapped there in Venezuela right now. Obviously, we, along with other carriers, have had trouble repatriating that in a timely fashion. In terms of point-of-sale shift, I'm going to turn that over to Jim.","James E. Compton","Hey, Helane, Jim. This is one where John and I are connected at the hip, because what we do is obviously manage the economics, so as the devaluation effects the overall results of the economics, the team understands that and tries to make the correct point of sale from a revenue management and a network perspective. It's a very strong point of sale out of Venezuela, but we do try to adjust for the impact of things such as devaluation. We work very closely with John's team on that.","John D. Rainey","And I would add, we are still waiting to hear based upon yesterday's announcement from the government if the cash that we have there can be repatriated at the older rate or the -- it's got to be repatriated at the new rate.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then can I just ask about the San Francisco hub? I think I read that they're closing the runways this summer like on an alternating basis to do maintenance. So can you just talk about that and how that's going to affect your operation and from an on-time perspective and so on?","Gregory L. Hart","Sure, Helane, this is Greg. Obviously, we're aware of the impact that's going to have in San Francisco and we a proactively gone out and reduced our schedule a little bit to help facilitate better performance of the hub in anticipation of some issues related to the runway closures.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. So that's all included in the full year guidance?","James E. Compton","Yes, Helane, this is Jim. Our guidance incorporates the runway closures.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we have Thomas Kim on line.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","What are your thoughts about industry capacity continuously ramping up in Asia, particularly in the view of the soft yield environment? For example, are there any signs of demand accelerating or should we be concerned here at all about further headwinds with regard to the overall impact on PRASM?","James E. Compton","Tom, this is Jim. A couple of comments. One, it's a very strong performing part of our network and continues to be, so given the economic growth in China in particular. We're excited about here is that we know the competitive challenges out there and, for instance, 20% growth of capacity we've seen in China, most of that -- really that capacity growth is into Beijing and Shanghai, which is why we talked about a second phase of our Pacific strategy of secondary cities, so the San Francisco-Chengdu point. The other piece is as we move through the year, we have a lot of initiatives in terms of getting the right aircraft on the right market. If you remember, we've talked about our 747 in the tech ops team has built back in tremendous reliability into that fleet. Whereas last year, we concentrated in San Francisco, this year we'll be able to place it in markets that better fit the demand. So for instance, Chicago to Shanghai and Chicago, Tokyo will be on the 74 and one of the 74s will actually go Chicago-Frankfurt. So the point being was from us, we have many initiatives to kind of optimize the network out there, and that's in kind of understanding the competitive pressures that are out there and working with what we think is the best footprint, the conversation about San Francisco earlier, there is no better gateway in terms of serving the Pacific. And we think with the moves we're making with the fleet, with our second phase of our Pacific strategy of secondary cities, we are well-positioned in an entity that operates at a really high level.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. What is your capacity growth plan for trans-Pac this year?","James E. Compton","We don't break out the entities. So all we've guided to is that system of 1% to 2% for 2014.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And John, can I ask you just a question with regard to GAAP-based taxes. How shall we be thinking about how that's going to be evolving as earnings continue to improve?","John D. Rainey","Sure, Tom. There's not a bright line test on when we begin booking taxes. At the end of 2014, we'll get with our accountants and we'll look at the various metrics that they evaluate. And for example, one of the things that looked -- that is evaluated is a cumulative 3-year earnings on a GAAP basis. And as we had a significant number of special charges in 2012, that actually put us into a GAAP loss position. But it's something that we'll evaluate at the end of 2014. And it would be a few years likely before we would pay cash taxes because we do have significant NOLs.","Operator","This concludes our investor analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take calls from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Bloomberg News, we have Mary Schlangenstein on line.","Mary Schlangenstein","I just wanted to see if you had any impact during the quarter or the full year from the valuation changes in the yen?","John D. Rainey","We did. We've had the depreciation of the yen hurt our results. In fact, in the fourth quarter, it resulted in about a half a point decline in our consolidated RASM because of what happened there with the yen. We are hedged a little bit more into 2014. We've got about 30% of our exposure hedged at a little bit less than where the market is today. So it's a slight gain position.","Operator","And from the Associated Press, we have Josh Freed on the line.","Josh Freed","You'd mentioned a little bit earlier about the storm impact in January. Did you give that in dollar terms and if you didn't, could you?","John D. Rainey","Sure, Josh. This is John Rainey. The storm impact on a revenue basis, gross revenue, was about $80 million. Obviously, as we canceled over 6,000 flights, we didn't consume as much fuel and we had some cost savings, which muted that impact. So the net impact to us in January was about $60 million.","Operator","And that is our final question, I will now turn it back over to our speakers for any final remarks.","Sarah Murphy","With that, actually, we're going to conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call media relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Please go ahead, Julie.","Julie Yates Stewart","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning everyone and welcome to United's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com.","Information in yesterday's release and investor update, the accompanying presentation and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also, during the course of the call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release and investor update, copies of which are available on our website.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy. We also have others in the room available to assist with Q&A.","And now I would like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Julie. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we review United's performance for the previous quarter, I want to address the events on last week. The incident on Flight 3411 has been a humbling, learning experience for all of us here at United and for me, in particular.","In addition to apologizing to Dr. Dao as well as all the passengers aboard, I also want to apologize to our customers. You can and should expect more from us and as CEO, I take full responsibility for making this right.","We've always sought to repay our customers' trust with the highest quality of service and deepest level of respect and dignity. We are and will make the necessary policy changes to ensure this never happens again.","Those changes began with two key announcements last week. First, from now on, we'll not call for law enforcement to remove passengers from our flight, except in cases of security or safety concerns. Second, crews traveling on our aircraft must be booked at least 60 minutes prior to departure.","In addition, we continue to review a broader array of policies and systems that factor into situations like this. And importantly, we are involving our front-line employees and, to a degree, some of our customers to help us take a more common-sense approach to how we do things. We'll communicate the results of our review and the additional actions we will take by April 30th.","Now if I could, turning to the topic of earnings and operational performance. As the positive financial results we will discuss today make clear, our people have done a great work to create a more reliable, profitable, and financially sound airline for our customers, investors and everyone we serve.","Our financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2017 gives us a lot of confidence about the foundation we're building, but it's clear we have further to go in terms of elevating the experience our customers have with us. This is a true learning opportunity and will ultimately prove to be a watershed moment for our company as we work harder than ever to put our customers at the center of everything we do.","Now, I'll turn it over to Scott to give an update on operations and revenue.","Scott Kirby","Thank you, Oscar, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I echo Oscar's thoughts on last week's incident. Our entire leadership team and the entire airline is focused on learning from this terrible event and making United truly customer-focused in everything that we do.","While we had a big failure last week, our 2017 operational and financial performance is off to a strong start. Building on a record 2016, we're already setting new operational records in 2017 and our performance improved as the quarter progressed. Demand is solid and we performed in line with our unit revenue forecast during the quarter despite better completion factor, which led to higher capacity.","The positive momentum and the revenue environment that we saw late last year continued into the first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter unit revenue growth is stronger today on higher capacity growth than it was just a few months ago.","We expect to return to positive system unit revenue growth in the second quarter, which will mark positive year-over-year growth in this key metric for the first time since early 2015, assuming the quarter plays out as we expect.","On slide five, we show operational improvements in the quarter. We remain focused on continually improving our operational reliability. Our completion factor performance in the quarter improved from last year, helped by 25 days of 100% mainline completion, which surpassed our annual record set just last year and is more perfect days than all of 2011 through 2015 combined.","Our mishandled baggage performance continues to improve. We achieved our best-ever consolidated on-time departure rate for February and any March, and year-to-date; each of our major competitors had canceled more than twice as many flights as has United.","Slide six illustrates how changes to our yield management posture are also allowing us to drive better revenue results. As you can see for the past two years, United had a philosophy of never letting advance booked load factor get behind.","For the past two years, our bookings 60 days in advance were never [indiscernible] 2% behind. And if your goal is to keep bookings high, the easiest way to do that is to lower the prices, and that's exactly what United was doing.","In fact, if you look at slide seven in our deck, we're just industry PRASM in general due to the step function change in the fourth quarter, and I think this was primarily driven by United reducing its reliance on advance-purchase discounts.","The second problem with this strategy was that we sold out too soon and spilled our natural market share of close-in business demand to our competitors. As you can see back on slide six, we changed that posture and are now willing to take much more risk that high-yield business customers are going to choose United if we just keep seats available for them.","And it's working. In the first quarter, our close-in bookings were up around 12% year-over-year and our corporate revenue was up 11% year-over-year compared with an average of down 1% for the last three quarters. The Easter shift and the extra Friday in March did help, but we also think this is evident that United is restoring its natural market share.","Despite starting well behind, you could see that we closed the load factor gap in both the fourth and first quarters and we expect and hope to do so again in the second quarter. This change leads to a better overall pricing environment and better mix and allows United to simply restore our natural close-in to business demand market share.","While all of our competitors are lowering their unit revenue outlook from the first quarter, our forecast started just below our guided midpoint and improved to flat despite a one point higher completion factor. This phenomenon at our competitors wasn't about demand weakness.","It was about United customers coming back to United, and we simply couldn't accommodate them in years past because we weren't leaving seats for the last minute bookings customers.","In the past, we forced many of our best customers to fly with our competitors because we were sold out and our changes now mean that they can and are returning to United Airlines. While the whole industry is seeing strong close-in demand, United is better positioned to capitalize on it with more seats to sell close-in on a year-over-year basis.","We expect the second quarter to be United's best PRASM performance in two years. Our consolidated PRASM was flat for the first quarter, right at the midpoint of our guidance provided in January despite running one point higher in completion factor.","We saw strong close-in demand in March, and throughout the quarter, we saw improvement across the system, with Houston, Washington Dulles and Chicago all showing positive year-over-year improvement.","Internationally, both the Atlantic and Pacific performance was better than forecasted. The strength in the Atlantic was boosted by strong results in Germany and a U.S. point-of-sale shift, while the Pacific was helped by positive PRASM in Japan.","We anticipate second quarter consolidated PRASM to be up 1% to 2% -- 1% to 3%, 200 basis points better than at the midpoint from the first quarter. If the quarter plays out like we think, this will mark the fifth straight quarter of sequential improvement and the first quarter of positive unit revenue growth in two years.","Moving to slide eight for an overview by region. During the second quarter, we expect sequential improvement in all geographies, except the Atlantic, which we expect will be approximately flat after surprising with positive growth in the first quarter. The Easter shift had a much more pronounced positive impact on yield in the Atlantic during March than we anticipated and we're now expecting an opposite impact in April.","We're currently forecasting solid positive unit revenue growth in domestic and Latin markets. Latin remains a bright spot, and we look for the year-over-year increase to be in the mid-single-digits in the second quarter, driven by strength in Brazil and Argentina and a tailwind from the Easter shift. In the Pacific, declines are expected to moderate again in the second quarter.","Our capacity outlook for the second quarter is up 3% to 4%. We expect that growth to be biased towards higher domestic growth with an increase of 4.5% to 5.5%. Our domestic year-over-year growth will peak in June and July, driven by improved utilization of our fleet this summer.","Our full year outlook for system capacity growth remains up 2.5% to 3.5% and is consistent with our updated guidance from March 15. Our capacity growth is comprised of nearly a 5% increase in gauge, partially offset by fewer departures. We're delivering on our promises from Investor Day, which included restoring the domestic network to its natural share in our hubs.","Everyone knows that United never should have been flying regional jets in markets like Chicago to Washington National or Newark to Atlanta. We're up-gauging where we should be flying larger planes, and that, by the way, is mostly in places where we historically did fly larger planes.","And we're putting smaller planes in markets that will drive better connectivity to our hubs, places like Champaign, Illinois and Rochester, Minnesota. These [indiscernible] markets have better pricing structure than large markets and help to improve connectivity in our hubs. We'll continue to improve connectivity, and we will start re-banking later this fall, which will be the next step in our network optimization.","We're even more excited about our opportunities today than we were at Investor Day five months ago, and we look forward to providing proof points that we're executing over the coming quarters and years.","To close, I want to, again, say that we're committed to learning from last week's failure by becoming the most customer-centric airline we can be in everything that we do.","Now, I'll turn it over to Andrew to review the financial results.","Andrew Levy","Thanks Scott. Before I turn to the numbers, I want to make it clear I share the sentiments expressed by Oscar and Scott about what occurred last week. Our entire team is working together to identify ways we can become a more customer-focused airline and are confident we will succeed in this goal.","Yesterday afternoon, we released our first quarter 2017 earnings as well as our second quarter investor update. I will discuss both our results and outlook at a high level, but please refer to those documents for additional detail.","Slide 10 is a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 11 shows our non-GAAP results. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. We generated pretax income of $196 million, which represented a 2.3% pretax margin excluding special items. First quarter 2017 results were lower year-over-year mostly due to higher fuel expense and labor rate increases.","Turning to slide 12, our first quarter non-fuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit-sharing and third-party expenses, increased 5% as compared with the first quarter 2016. 4.2 percentage points of this increase was due to new labor rates from the 2016 agreements.","For the second quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit-sharing and third-party expenses, to increase between 4% and 5%, with approximately four percentage points of this increase due to the higher labor rates.","Last month, we reduced our guidance for full year 2017 non-fuel unit costs to an increase of between 2.5% and 3.5%. We are affirming this guidance today despite elevated unit cost growth in the first quarter and our forecasted increase in the second quarter of 4.5% at the midpoint of the guided range. We expect the increase in nonfuel unit costs to slow appreciably during the last two quarters of the year.","Turning to slide 13, we ended the first quarter with $6.4 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our recently increased $2 billion revolver, which is comfortably in excess of our stated minimum liquidity target range. As of the end of the first quarter, our gross debt balance, including capitalized operating leases was $17.6 billion.","During the quarter, we completed several financing transactions that improved our liquidity by $1.35 billion. This included raising $300 million of unsecured debt at a rate of 5%, increasing our term loan by $440 million to $1.5 billion with more favorable terms and rate, and also upsizing our revolver by $650 million to the $2 billion number I gave you a minute ago.","In the quarter, we spent $313 million repurchasing shares at an average price of about $68 a share. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders and will continue to be opportunistic to take advantage of pullbacks in the stock. We currently have approximately $1.5 billion remaining of repurchase authority.","Our 2017 guidance for CapEx remains between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion. This is higher than 2016 due primarily to the delivery of 15 wide-body aircraft. Also during the quarter, we purchased 12 737NGs off lease. These are not incremental aircraft to the fleet, but rather aircraft we've operated since new. We expect to enter into many similar transactions when we can cost-effectively purchase leased aircraft that we expect to operate for many years instead of acquiring new aircraft to replace equipment at the end of the lease term.","Additionally, we expect to grow the fleet by adding used aircraft. Growing with used aircraft is much less capital-intensive, provides us with greater balance sheet flexibility and therefore, de-risks our business at the margin.","Lastly, regarding our fleet, we continue our comprehensive review of the fleet and order book. We continue our work and we will update you when we have new information to share.","On slide 14, we show summary of our guidance, including second quarter projected fuel price range, which is using the April 12 curve. The ranges for capacity, revenue and costs imply a second quarter pretax margin between 10% and 12%.","In conclusion, we're off to a solid start in 2017 and remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and finding incremental cost-savings opportunities.","With that, I'd like to thank you all for joining the call today, and I'll now turn it back to Julie to open it up for Q&A.","Julie Yates Stewart","Thank you, Andrew. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if need one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","And from Cowen, we have Helane Becker online. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody. Thank you very much for your time. Just on the bookings over the past -- I mean, this is like very short-term-focused, but are you hearing from any of your corporate accounts about adjusting bookings or whatever for the -- given United's performance over the last couple of weeks with various incidences?","Scott Kirby","We had a lot of communication with our corporate accounts, and we've had appropriate questions and concerns, particularly with regard to our corporate accounts, with whom we have a good relationship and we've already communicated with. We feel pretty good about the communications that we've had so far and in our ability to reassure them and explain things like overbooking.","Some of the steps that we will do with the broader public on our April 30 launch but some of that with our corporate accounts, we've been able to accelerate some of that -- some of their specific concerns. And our sales team has done a wonderful job of being out, talking to them if there has been a concern from corporate accounts, which has been totally appropriate.","We feel like we've managed that pretty well. And our corporate accounts are largely supportive. They want us to fix this. They want us to do the right thing. But they believe in us and believe that we will get this fixed. And at the end of the day, we will be stronger, and we will have better customer service when we get through this. ","Oscar Munoz","And Helane, this is Oscar. I echo the same sentiments. I've had -- go ahead, Helane.","Helane Becker","No. I was just actually -- I mean, I don't want to beat this up. I just was going to change the subject and actually ask you about regional -- regions in the domestic market. I know you were talking about improvement in various domestic markets, and I wonder if there are any specific areas of improvement that you would call out as being noteworthy. And that was all.","Scott Kirby","Well, we saw improvement -- we saw PRASM up, actually, the most in Houston. To some degree, that's -- we have less capacity in Houston. We're looking forward to actually re-banking Houston starting later this year, which will allow us the platform to grow Houston and actually improve PRASM even more. The energy sector in Houston, while still down significantly compared to where it was historically, is starting to at least recover from a very low base.","Our energy accounts have [rounding up] [ph] 13% during the quarter. We also saw strength in Dulles and Chicago, and the rest of the hubs, while down a little bit, were all down pretty marginally.","So really, I would say for the most part, across the board, we're starting to see an improved revenue environment, and we really feel good about the revenue environment, really, across the board.","Helane Becker","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","From Citigroup, we have Kevin Crissey online. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey","Good morning. Thanks for the time. Can we talk about the international partners maybe in a big picture, the evolution of the international partnerships, their importance overall, where your strengths and opportunities exist, maybe just a big picture on where international partnerships and alliances and JVs, as you see it, are heading? Thank you.","Scott Kirby","Well, international JV and partnerships are incredibly important to our customers. They are a way to give a seamless experience to our customers, to get them around the world. This is one of those rare events that if they win, win, win; it's a win for United Airlines. It could be a win for our partners, and it's absolutely a win for our customers.","I think we -- and Star Alliance, we all believe that we have an opportunity to do better. We can be more seamlessly integrated with one another and that includes on the commercial front, but to a large degree, that includes the customer experience, where we can make the experience more seamless.","And we have a new CEO at Star Alliance, and that is his number one mission. I'll actually be going to the Star Alliance meeting on Mother's Day, which my wife doesn't appreciate, but it's in Germany. And the focus of the meeting is to talk about how we can create a more seamless experience for our customers and really have the focus to be on customers.","And we think there's a big opportunity there, and that's something that we'll be working on over the coming years. But our partnerships are really important, and we're looking forward to expanding partnerships, particularly in Latin America with Avianca and Copa, and we think there's a real opportunity. But we have strong partnerships across the Atlantic and Pacific. Adding Avianca, Copa and Azul to those relationships is going to give us the ability to give the American and LatAm a run for their money in Latin America.","Kevin Crissey","So Scott, would you say that that's the region where you have the biggest opportunity for improvement is in the Latin America region?","Scott Kirby","Well, we have opportunity for improvement everywhere, but it's the least developed region for us. So yes, it's the area with the most opportunity for improvement.","Kevin Crissey","Thank you for your time.","Operator","We have Michael Linenberg on the line. Please standby for just a moment. Michael Linenberg is on the line, please go ahead sir.","Michael Linenberg","Yes, hey thanks. Two questions here. Hey, Scott, I just want to go back to -- you mentioned Houston, Dulles and Chicago seeing PRASM improvement. Just specifically looking at Newark, if it weren't for the fact that Newark-Florida fares were somewhat depressed, if we were to exclude that, would have Newark's PRASM been up?","Scott Kirby","Newark what fares?","Michael Linenberg","If you were to exclude -- to Florida.","Scott Kirby","Excluding Florida. I mean, Newark was down 1%, and so I don't know. And actually, what's happened in Newark is there was a flood of low-cost carrier capacity, and for a long time, United Airlines did not match the prices. We started matching the prices and I think our revenues, while down in those markets, is down less than it was before. So, we feel really good about that strategy.","At least our incremental change in strategy and competing more aggressively with the low-cost carriers in Newark, I think, is revenue positive. To be clear, with all the capacity in Florida, PRASM is certainly down, but it was down even more before we decided to start competing aggressively. ","Michael Linenberg","Well. And then just my second question, Andrew, you talked about growing the fleet with used aircraft. And I guess up until this point, you've -- predominantly, it's -- well, I shouldn't say predominantly, it's all been narrow-body. And I'm curious about your thoughts about used wide-bodies. I think the view out in the marketplace is that reconfiguration costs are too high. Hence, we don't see airlines really look at used wide-bodies. I mean, what are your thoughts on that? Are there opportunities there for you, if you can elaborate? ","Andrew Levy","Yes. Hey, Mike.","Michael Linenberg","Hey.","Andrew Levy","The wide-body market is severely depressed across the board. There's tremendous opportunities in the used market. There's a lot of really good high-quality aircraft available at very, very attractive low rates. So you're right that the reconfiguration costs are certainly more significant, and it's, perhaps, a little bit tougher to make the economics work in a normal situation.","Certainly, with the -- today, I think we're in a different period in the market, and so we are actively looking at wide-bodies and narrow-bodies and we'll see. I think obviously, the weakness in demand for that sector has been well documented. It's nothing new. And I know the OEMs are feeling it as well. So, we'll see if we can take advantage of the dislocations that we believe is there and will continue to be there for quite some time.","Michael Linenberg","Great. Thanks Andrew.","Andrew Levy","Thanks.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hey good morning. Scott, at the Analyst Day in November, you said that historically, inflections in RASM usually involve a couple months of nail-biting, where you're behind on advance bookings, which is exactly what's happening, obviously, in slide six. So we're obviously more than a couple months into it at this point.","So I guess the question is, are you deep enough into this point where you can say that you're seeing that big turn, which is what you described it as in November, in the revenue environment? Or do you need a couple more months to go before you can safely say that we have had that big turn, which are your words that you said in November?","Scott Kirby","Well, Hunter, you've followed me long enough to know that I'm an optimist by nature, so take what I'm going to say with a grain of salt. But yes, I think we had a great turn in revenue in the fourth quarter. If you can just look at that graph, I think it was slide, what, six or seven for us and you can see going from RASM that is down 7.4%, down 6.6%, down 5.8%, all of a sudden to down 1.6%. That's a big step function change and there really wasn't a big change in industry capacity at that point, not a flat, not up to -- something changed in the fourth quarter.","And my hypothesis is that what changed in the fourth quarter was United's revenue management philosophy, which leads to a pricing philosophy change and that has changed and we expect things to continue to grow.","What's not even in these numbers which will bear in the second half of the year is Basic Economy, which we think is going to be really big, predictably by the time we get it at steady state. But I think there was inflection point in the fourth quarter and I feel pretty good that that has happened.","Hunter Keay","Okay. And this is actually sort of a related question. You mentioned Basic Economy. I want to get back to a question asked a few months ago about distribution as well. In an ideal world, if you're able to get the distribution paradigm sort of adjusted to exactly how you want it to be.","Is there more of an opportunity to drive incremental revenues at the really, really low end like through things like Basic Economy or at the really, really high end by turning airlines into -- dynamically, you're competing on things like product and schedule, with price way at the bottom of the list. So, the question is, low-end or high-end opportunity as it relates to the distribution changes that you expect over the next couple of years.","Scott Kirby","Well, I think that there's opportunity on both. At United, and I said this at my previous airline, roughly half of our revenue is coming from infrequent customers and half is coming from premium customers, customers that fly as often.","And it's a little over simplistic to say that, that half of revenue coming from infrequent customers just cares about price because a lot them care about more than that. It's also -- the flip side is true that some of our frequent customers are really shopping on price as well. But at a high level, you can think of it simplistically as half and half and we need to fuel both.","And that's the wonderful thing about Basic Economy. It is giving our customers choice. So, for those customers who do care about price -- and by the way, at launch this morning, we had a couple of flights go out and smooth and we're encouraged with the initial launch from Minneapolis today.","But for our customers who want a lower price, it's fantastic that we can give them that. And for customers who want a higher level of service and who are willing to pay for a higher level of service and a better product, we can give them that as well.","This is all about giving our customers' choice, and I think it will happen on both ends. It will make our product more attractive to customers. We are focused on getting the absolute lowest rock-bottom price, and it will also attract customers who would like to have a better level of service and a better product and are willing to pay for that.","Hunter Keay","Thank you, Scott.","Operator 24 ","From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth online. Please go ahead.","Savanthi Syth","Good morning. Just on the regional space, Scott, it sounds like you're putting these aircraft in kind of mission-appropriate markets. And now that you've had a chance to review the network and maybe adoption rates to increase connectivity, are you still thinking that the regional fleet will be flattish after the year-end 2017 levels? And on that -- the Air Wisconsin deal, I was wondering how big that deal is and if that puts cost pressure or if it's cost neutral.","Scott Kirby","So conceptually, if there were no constraints, meaning particularly no pilot constraints, we would probably be growing the regional fleet and adding more of those regional markets. To be clear, we wouldn't be flying them in places like Dulles to Chicago or Newark to Atlanta. We will be flying them in places like Rochester, Minnesota, where they're more appropriate.","So our regional fleet is less about -- our regional lift is going to be less about our optimal network strategy and much more about our regional partners' ability to source aircraft and pilots, in particular.","We -- as a general rule, most of those deals are trading down over time, and we are losing aircraft. That's one of the great things about the Air Wisconsin deal is we were able to go get aircraft that are going to come in at a price that's kind of right in the middle of our prices on other deals, so it's attractive economics and to a large degree, will offset some of the shrinking that we expect to occur at our other regional partners.","And we're hoping that our other regional partners can actually keep flying some of those aircraft longer. In fact, SkyWest, [Indiscernible], our numbers have gone up for aircraft at the end of the year because it turns out they're going to be able to fly some of those aircraft a little longer than we thought. But at the end of the day, it's going to be driven -- our regional count -- aircraft count is going to be driven much more by the pilot availability than it is by our optimal fleet plan.","Savanthi Syth","Got it. Thank you. And Andrew if I might ask a quick question. You might have mentioned this in the opening remarks, but now that you've upped the credit facility, is the cash target, is that unchanged? Or are you changing that as well?","Andrew Levy","Our cash target remains between $5 billion and $6 billion. That's a range we're comfortable with. And as you can tell, we're well above that at the current time. So, no, we don't expect to change that target range at all.","Savanthi Syth","Got it. All right, thanks guys.","Operator","From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, thanks for the time. Scott, when you were at American, you embarked on a hub rebanking effort, which I think, in general, leads to a slightly higher-cost operation exchanged -- in exchange for higher revenue. And I wondered if you could use some of the lessons that you learned there to tell us what you think the CASM hit might be over the next couple of years as you try to re-bank the United network.","Scott Kirby","Look, it does cost more to run a banked operation than otherwise. I think it's pretty small. It was a rounding error at American. It worked really well. It will work really well here. I would point at American to Dulles, which had all the craziness going on with the Wright Amendment and the growth of Spirit, all that just huge headwinds, and yet Dulles was outperforming consistently on PRASM quarter after quarter because of the higher levels of connectivity. So, I'm not sure what the CASM number will be, but I'm highly confident that the increase in revenue will more than offset the PRASM hit.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Andrew, can you give some more color on what's in the other expense category these days? If we look at that as a total -- as a percentage of total operating expense or as a percentage of revenue, there's clearly some growth going on. It's a line item that now has overtaken consolidated fuel expense, for example. What's in there? And what's driving the growth?","Andrew Levy","Well, there's a lot of items in there, as you noted, Jamie. What we're seeing that's driving the growth in this particular quarter is IT, contracted labor, legal, timing of legal [Indiscernible], which is part of the increase year-over-year; maintenance services, which should be a variety of things, including software support. And also, food is in that line item, and that's also elevated significantly year-over-year, partly driven by the Polaris service launch that occurred at fourth quarter -- late fourth quarter of last year.","Jamie Baker","Okay, that's helpful. And second question for Scott. As we think about your normal market share in your hubs, and I recognize every hub is going to be different, but how does the -- I mean, does your 2020 margin goals specifically require a level of pricing power that's unattainable unless you increase share by, I don't know, more than 5%, 10%? I mean, basically, can you achieve your margin goal with domestic hub share below 50%, with the exception of Houston?","Scott Kirby","Well, look, I don't think of it as market share driving pricing power. I think of it more as 2 things: one, driving higher levels of connectivity. When we don't have these higher levels, we have lower levels of connectivity that's high yield [Technical Difficulty] that's completely missing from the network and just giving to your competitors.","And second, places like -- let's just take Newark because I talk about it a lot. We have a Newark-based global services or 1K customer, and we started flying the regional jet to Atlanta and regional jets to Dulles and regional jets to Detroit. We pushed that global services customer, who is a high-yield customer, who booked at the last minute to fly on Delta and American in those markets.","And beyond that, that customer used to just be a Newark-based customer that was on American -- or United Airlines' frequent flyer program and flew exclusively on United. But now, all of a sudden, anywhere they flew, they decided to go shop because we forced them to carry free frequent flyer cards in their wallet, and because of that, they're no longer global services because they didn't fly on United all the time. We lost those customers.","So it's not about pricing power. It's about winning back the loyalty and giving a better product to our best customers so that they choose and want to fly United Airlines. And so -- go ahead.","Jamie Baker","No, go ahead, sorry. Sorry. ","Scott Kirby","I was just going to say restoring is not about gaining pricing power or anything like that. It's about creating the best product for our customers in those markets so that they'd want to choose to fly United exclusively.","Jamie Baker","All right. So, it's more about the quality of the ASMs that you add in your hub than just attaining a share number, in other words.","Scott Kirby","Absolutely.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Because I think that point is lost in a lot of investors, so I appreciate you clarifying it. I'm sorry. Did I cut you off, Oscar?","Oscar Munoz","No. I just wanted to -- I will go back a little bit to your question to Andrew with regards to the other expense category. I think it's important to note that Andrew specifically is leading an initiative to bring down cost in the company across the board, and we had some success in that, and that's what we'd committed.","Additionally, with some of the components that we mentioned, I think we have to recognize that they're investments for the customer, right, what do you think of Polaris, what you think of the IT organization. Some of the tools that we rolled out already this year have had a significant level of improvement how we treat our customers.","So, we'll continue to manage that and talk a little bit more of that specifically because you will see that cost trend potentially continue. But again, there's initiatives to offset it, plus it's getting a return with regards to our revenue and passenger loads. ","Jamie Baker","Three thoughtful answers. Thank you very much.","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Just two questions on the loyalty program, which hasn't gotten a lot of love today. So Scott, based on the disclosures that United provides around the economics of MileagePlus, it appears that the program is considerably less valuable than American. So American disclosed $1.9 billion marketing revenue in 2016, United disclosed $1.2 billion, American is expecting an incremental $800 million in EBIT by 2018 from the new credit card deal. You're expecting only 8 -- only $300 million. So structurally, is there a reason why United's business of selling miles to third parties is less valuable than American's? Or your disclosures understate the value you received?","Scott Kirby","I do think that we have different disclosure policies, and this is something we are going to work on. Andrew Levy is nodding his head at me. It's a big initiative for Andrew to figure out how we disclose this better. It's something that we are going to do -- or at least intent to. I think your simplistic analysis -- it would be hard for you to know because we put it in other lines, but isn't right.","One thing it is right is that at the moment, Americas' growth rate is much higher. Delta's growth rate also is much higher from today's date. That's the bad news. The good news is, I believe that our partner -- partners at JPMorgan Chase understand that and understand how important it is to get us on the same growth trajectory. We've kind of had a reset of the relationship here in the past few months, and they've committed to getting us to have the same kind of growth rates.","And look, we are actually to be growing faster. We're growing faster as an airline. We're growing our capacity faster and so we frankly, ought to be growing faster than those guys. That's not at all on JPMorgan Chase, a lot of that is at United, things like we weren't allowing them to offer the credit card to customers onboard. That's the best acquisition channel that American Airlines had. It was -- I've been told best acquisition channel with Delta and United wasn't doing.","So, there are things that we can do to get our growth rates up. We're going need to do it in combination with Chase, but we look forward to getting that accelerated in the months and years to come.","Joseph DeNardi","So Scott, does that add some upside to what you laid out that Investor Day then?","Scott Kirby","There's nothing about that in the Investor -- assuming we're successful in that regard it would be upside.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then Andrew, I guess, what we have done is really just value the business you guys have of -- and other airlines of selling miles to third parties. But I'm just wondering if just bigger picture you can address the opportunity you see for the company just being able to better monetize the 90 million members you have in MileagePlus beyond just selling them air travel? I mean, this is a marketing company essentially. How much is each of those customers worth to you longer term beyond just selling them tickets?","Andrew Levy","Hey, Joe, let me go back to the first answer by the way. I think Scott hit the nail right on the head. We don't disclose the same way. If we did, the difference in valuation would be much -- or the difference in the numbers that you cited would be much smaller. And so as we mentioned, we're going to work to find a way to disclose this really valuable business in a way that people can understand better because it is unique and very attractive.","I think the question you asked about driving incremental revenue, I don't think that's limited to simply MileagePlus members. We communicate with a lot of customers, we carry a lot of customers, we have a lot of this on the website. And we've talked a lot about different ways we can monetize or do a better job of monetizing the eyeballs that reach our website and the members of our mileage program and how to enhance our mileage program.","So, I think that, that hasn't been the first priority. We're focused on the things we talked about at Investor Day, which were kind of foundational. But it is the focus of ours, and we've had a number of discussions and at some point, we will really put a lot more time and effort into backsliding the opportunity there, which we do agree with you it exist and is quite substantial but really hard to quantify it.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you very much.","Operator","From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions and Oscar, appreciate the comments. Accidents happen and I think your hard-working frontline in place probably deserve a little bit more credit than all the negative media attention. So hopefully, we can put this behind us. But from an investor perspective, I think, Scott, what folks are worried about here is that we saw the capacity increase domestically in the past month, one and a half.","The concern here is that maybe we're a little bit more focused on market share than margins. You've benchmarked to Delta publicly. Their guidance for 2Q is a good bit ahead of you here although you are showing a lot of sequential improvement in 2Q as well.","So, how can you re-ensure your investor base here that this capacity addition indeed is restructuring the network to help you capture that margin Delta and that we should be thinking this is going to be quite accretive as we move into 2018?","Scott Kirby","Well, look, we used the term -- I try to avoid actually market share and try to say natural share more often than market share because this is not a play to go get market share. This is really about restoring United to its natural share. And United get a lot -- took a lot of accidents in the past three to four years, which caused it to lose its natural share and which hurt its financials.","And you guys used to get on this earnings call and beat them up about why aren't your financials good. And you gave them a cure for that, which was cut capacity, cut capacity, cut capacity and it just made the problem worse.","And despite taking the same medicine quarter-after-quarter as the numbers got worse and worse and worse that was part of the problem when the airline was cutting capacity and taking regional jets out of places that set the network like Rochester, Minnesota and redeploying them in places like Newark to Atlanta, in order to keep capacity low. That was driving margins lower.","And so I'm trying to be careful to say what we're doing is restoring United to its natural market share, to a position it was in the past, and it's working so far. I mean, it's actually working faster even than I would have thought, the fact that our guidance with this cutting capacity is for RASM up 1% to 3%.","And by the way, we've got number of issues that are driving about -- our flown PRASM is actually higher than that. We've got some accounting issues that are going to be 50 to 70 basis points headwind in this quarter. Those are just the things that happened, but our core performance is even stronger.","I mean, we just -- early on, we feel really good about how well this is working. It's logical. This is not trying to go invade someone's hub. This is about restoring United to where it should've been and we had some unforced errors. And we were double faulting and giving points to the competitors, and we've stopped double faulting and that, I think, is just going to be getting us back to our natural market share. I don't think it's disruptive. I wouldn't describe the reason that we're doing as disruptive. We're just returning to where United's natural market shares.","We're going to be very careful to calibrate how it's working and how we're doing. We're only a few months into this, but I tell you, we're off to a really good start. We won't be perfect, we'll stumble. I mean we had a stumble last week in operations. We'll have stumbles on the commercial side, but we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on.","Oscar Munoz","And I would just add, Brandon, and reiterate what I think I said a couple of times publicly. This is a thoughtful approach with lots of team members involved. Andrew Nocella has just joined us, and joined the team and is really in charge of most of that day in and day out.","So really thoughtful, but at the same time opportunistic because it is a unique opportunity as Scott outlined that we have and the list of opportunities continues to be a fairly large one, how we do it in a thoughtful balanced way is sort of the course of the day. But I can tell you that market share is not a conversation we have in this room or with our board, it is all about margin. And so, again, I just want to reiterate that point.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Oscar, I appreciate that. But I think you even said it publicly before this is a not a shift in long-term strategy that United is about to grow capacity now at or above GDP. This is, indeed, a shift in the network, is that incorrect?","Oscar Munoz","I'm sorry? ","Scott Kirby","Yes, I think that's probably correct. I'm not sure I'd say exactly that. This is not an attempt to go build an empire and go win the market share. It is an attempt to restore United to its natural position. And once there, I would anticipate we will be growing in line with GDP. ","Brandon Oglenski","All right. Appreciate it.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora online. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi good morning everyone. Thank you for question. I guess, Scott, asking the capacity question another way, we can see there's a three to four percentage point pick up in your main line utilization in the back half of the year from June through December. This does put you ahead of where the other legacies are and kind of closer to your big LCC competition. Is there the ability to push this even -- is there the ability to push this even higher or you've kind of maxed out with where you are on the current fleet?","Scott Kirby","Okay, you're just talking about our utilization?","Andrew Didora","Yes, main line.","Scott Kirby","Yes, certainly in the back half of the year, if we wanted to, we could push utilization higher. The utilization is lower in the first and fourth quarters because demand is lower. And so we could push it higher, but -- and not -- to guarantee that we won't change it at all, but it's a much bigger hurdle. It's operationally easy to push it higher, it's financially harder to justify pushing it higher in off peak periods.","Andrew Didora","Got it. And then just -- haven't had much discussion on Trans-Atlantic, the numbers in 1Q and the 2Q guidance was actually much better than I was expecting given all the -- low-cost competition coming on. What have you -- what are some of the actions you've taken on the Trans-Atlantic to help offset some of this kind of new flying that's coming in?","Scott Kirby","So, at least for the Star Alliance and so forth, United and flying to the Star Alliance countries, we have not restructured pricing in those markets. And the Sky Team and Oneworld Alliance, pricing has been restructured and lowered. We keep track of the lowest published fares by AP across our whole system, and those aren't always selling fares because yield management bucket sell out at different airlines.","But the Sky Team and Oneworld markets fares -- advance purchase fares are down, call it 20% to 30%. They're down about 10% in the Star Alliance markets because there are growth of low-cost carriers and other things that drive those down, but our pricing is much better in those markets than in the other markets.","Now, of course, we carry a lot of revenue to those countries, we carry a lot of revenues in the U.K. and to Paris, so we're impacted by that. But we are less impacted by that. Also, at least, in this portion of the year, we're disproportionately selling U.S. point of sale and U.S. point of sale is really strong. I will caution you that as we move to the back half of the summer, the normal demand pattern shifts to European point-of-sale.","And so I would expect RASM to be still be high-capacity. RASM to be under more pressure in the back half because once people starts going back to school here in the U.S., the second half of that peak summer season is really much more about Europeans coming to the U.S. and so I'd anticipate in the third quarter a little more weakness just given the European point-of-sale was weak -- was strong.","Andrew Didora","Great. Thank you.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Scott, a couple of quick questions for you. Just first, on your comments on restoring natural market share. What's the timeline to actually get that? Is that a one, two-year thing, a 10-year thing? How are you envisioning it?","Scott Kirby","I think we don't know yet, that's for TBD. And I don't think we can --- even if we could do a complete analysis and it just depends on what -- on how the markets evolving and how the new flying and new routes are going to be doing. It's really bottoms up analysis, We're not trying to do a top down and say, here's where we're going to be X years from now, we're doing bottoms up one by one, we're watching the performance of those routes as we up-guage them, or as we add new routes.","And it's going to be a judgment that's based on how those things are doing when we get to the point where we're adding flying, and it's not margin accretive, then we'll know probably reach that point. But that's probably going to be the metric where we've decided we've reached that point.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And post your decision to adjust your capacity for the year, what kind of response have you seen from some of your peers and some of the markets where you're at, or have you not seen any real response?","Scott Kirby","Look, it's -- we're trying to do it what's right for United Airlines. And because what I think we're doing is really about -- we're not trying to invade someone's market, or do -- we're not trying to create a competitive battle, we are trying to compete that I wouldn't have expected and haven't seen much response.","I mean, look, take a market like Newark to Atlanta where 5 years ago, we flew 8 mainline flights or call it 150 seats per flight, and so we had 1,200 seats a day in that market. Delta flew 12 mainlines so you can call it 12x150, so they had 1,800 seats. We were 40% of the market; they were 60% of the market.","We shot that down to 6 50-seat regional jets, so were down to 300. And so we were -- and Delta stayed at 1,800 that whole time. And so we were one seventh of the market from 40%. We've now quadrupled our capacity and gone back to 1,200 seats today. And we're back -- right back to where we were before. We're at 40% of the market.","I think that's probably the natural share between Newark to Atlanta. Atlanta is a bigger hub with more connectivity and that 40-60 ratio is probably about right. Is it possible that Delta is going to decide to quadruple capacity and go for flying -- in every bank, they're already flying every bank, 12 flights today, are they going to try to fly 48 flights today? I doubt it. That hasn't happened. It wouldn't be rational.","So I guess I'd say because of the kind of capacity that we're adding or we're re-upgauging, some of those hub-to-hub markets, and we're adding competitive capacity or adding capacity in places like Chicago to Rochester, Minnesota, we didn't anticipate a respond and we certainly don't think we've seen one. And that's about all we said now.","Rajeev Lalwani","If I could sneak in one quick one. Scott, you've provided some good color on the Trans-Atlantic market. How are you thinking about Asia?","Scott Kirby","Well, Asia has been the region under the most pressure because the capacity -- incredibly high growth in capacity. As we get to the second half of this year, we're through the bilateral, particularly to Beijing and Shanghai so capacity growth will moderate in those cities. There are still awful lot of capacity coming from secondary cities. So United is one of the first -- well, the only U.S. airlines -- one of the first airlines to the party and flying to those secondary cities.","But it's -- that's going to continue to be a challenge, particularly with the kind of subsidies that people are getting to open up new routes out of China from secondary cities. But the core of China, which is really about Beijing and Shanghai looks like capacity will moderate in the back half of the year. So, we're hopeful that the Pacific PRASM will start to improve in the back half.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you.","Operator","From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth ","Hey, thanks. I was hoping to hear from Greg Hart. Is he on the line?","GregoryHart","Yes.","Duane Pfennigwerth ","Hey Greg. As you're thinking about this plan to grow domestic capacity, nearly 6% in the June quarter, it would be great to hear from you, your level of involvement in that aggressive plans, what preparations you've made, what lead times look like for staffing and training. And then what gives you confidence that United historically more careful approach to utilization flying is now able to change?","Gregory Hart","Yes, thanks for the question, Duane. I would say that we've been working on our capability to do this sort of thing for years, and this isn't something we started working on over the past couple of months. We've been focused on developing systems processes, the health of our fleet and lots of other things to make sure that we had the capability to do this.","My team has been involved, along with the finance team and Scott's team in every step of the way here and in fact, I feel really comfortable as does the rest of the team that we're going to be able to deliver on what we've committed to and our performance here before would suggest that we've got a great structure in place to allow us to do that. And of course, our employees are really excited about the opportunity to grow the airline again.","Duane Pfennigwerth ","Okay, I appreciate that comment and that it was years in the making. It's -- it is keen to surprise your finance team for what it's worth when this first started to show up in the schedules. With respect to calibration which, I think, is the most interesting word I heard on this call, United has low relative margins. Those margins are still declining and the company's proposed solution to correcting that is a higher growth rate.","So going back to Rajeev's question, how will you measure if that proposed solution is working? And I think investors deserve more than kind of a 4-year goal. What is the timeframe by which you'll measure if it's working that would lead to potential calibration?","Scott Kirby","Look, we're measuring today and our principal metrics are going to be absolute and relative margin. That doesn't mean quarter-to-quarter because there's going to be fuel price spikes and there's going to be fuel price decline and there's going to be timing of labor deals at our airline or other airlines.","But we look at our relative and absolute margins, and we look at it over kind of a trailing 12-month period, and it adjust for things like fuel hedge losses. And those numbers look like we're doing a good job today, and we feel pretty confident. We believe that, that's going to work going forward.","I mean, you look at least relative to Delta. In the first quarter, we had higher RASM, better CASM performance, so a lot of other moving pieces in that hedge losses and things that make the numbers a little hard to look at. But that would imply that we're closing the margin gap. Expect we will do so; continue to do so as we move through the rest of the year.","And we just -- we feel really good about the path that we're on. We think we are moving towards sustainably closing both the absolute improvement in margins and relative to RASM gap, but that's what we're going to look at and we're not waiting for you to look at that, we're looking at that every day.","Oscar Munoz","And I would just cap it off with that that is big component of our long-term compensation plan.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions]","From the Associated Press, we have David Koenig. Please go ahead.","David Koenig","Yes, good morning. This is for Oscar. I know you're talking about April 30, but I wonder if you could give any more light on what you're thinking about, and specifically are you considering in response to what happened last week on United Express, are you considering simply ending involuntary denied boardings with all the sales policy changes that, that entails.","Oscar Munoz","Hey David. We are looking at a broad array of issues that affected not only that situation or our broader customer experience. And so we are hard at work at that and have been for the last few days and I'll ask all of you to wait until that time when we talk about it.","David Koenig","You can't rule that in or out?","Oscar Munoz","I think I would rather wait until we've done the full work and then we'll report on it next week.","Operator","From Bloomberg News, we have Michael Sasso. Please go ahead.","Michael Sasso","Yes. There's certainly was some conjecture that somebody could lose his job over the situation last week. Can you say at the board level or in the management level, was there any of that founded? Was there ever talk of anyone losing their job within management, lower down?","Oscar Munoz","This is Oscar. Michael, the buck stops here, and I'm sure, there was lots of conjecture about me personally. I think I've met with the board and the board has met independently and we've had fulsome conversations that I'll be involved in some of that work that we're doing, going forward as well as they always have been. I have issued the letter of support, but to your specific question, again, it was a system failure across various areas. So no, there was never a consideration for firing an employee or anyone around it.","Operator","From THE STREET, we have Ted Reed. Please go ahead.","Ted Reed","Thank you. Speaking about changes comparisons with Delta. Delta always says they have a revenue premium. This could -- they said 108%. Do you have a revenue premium to the airline industry?","Scott Kirby","Well, Ted, I hate that metric because if we calculate the numbers here at United, yes, we have a revenue premium and yes, it's higher even than Delta. American also, by the way, when I got there said they had a revenue premium. Because everyone makes all these adjustments to the numbers on stage length and density and a whole bunch of other stuff and so with all the caveats everyone calculates that they have a revenue premium.","I think margin is what matters. You can make your revenue premium go up by taking a row of seats off airplanes, for example, and that makes your RASM get higher. You could fly only first class seats on airplanes, and that will make your RASM higher and we give you a revenue premium and have a real cost problem. And so I think looking at margin, we are focused on margin, in closing the margin gap and improving our absolute and relative margin. ","Ted Reed","All right. I would also like to ask there was this reaction in China to the incident. Have you seen any impact on China bookings because of that incident last week?","Scott Kirby","We've only had a few days and it's a small numbers problem. There's a lot of volatility in bookings for point-of-sale China, so it's really too early for us to say anything about it.","Oscar Munoz","And Ted, it's Oscar. I would add that there certainly has been some sentiment and I did visit with the Chinese Consulate here locally to discuss that with them. And I will be heading out there in a couple weeks to have further conversations with customers and related governmental officials.","Ted Reed","You mean in reaction to this, you're going to make a China trip?","Oscar Munoz","No, it's been a trip that was planned for some time. There was a lot of other activities going on. It's just a normal travel that I'll do as we run a fairly global airline and we have lots of occasions and employees out there as well as customers.","Ted Reed","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And from CNN, we have John (inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good morning. A question about -- you just spoke about corporate customers earlier. How are you seeing an effect at all on leisure customers and in the overall trends in the wake of last week's incident?","Scott Kirby","Again, it's really too early for us to tell anything about bookings and in particular last week because it was the week before Easter, that's normally a very low booking period, so we just really don't have any quantifiable data. Our forecast for the quarter didn't change at all.","We do a weekly forecast that stays to the tenth of a percent exactly the same as it was before, but it's just really hard for us to look at data in the week before Easter and have a good view of whether there was a measurable bookings impact or not?","Oscar Munoz","And John, I would just add that I've sent out a personal note to a person who is legit, intimate things you can sent to hundreds of thousands of people but to our -- at least at this point, to our most loyal customers and the response rate has been pretty high and positive. Obviously, a lot of people have ideas and thoughts about how we can make things better. But in that particular segment of our highest end customers, there's been a lot of support.","Unidentified Analyst","And Oscar, in that same vein, I mean, your rival in September 2015 really focused on a creating more employee-focused culture. I'm curious just kind of to go back to the early parts of last week and your comments about emphatically supporting employees.","And that statement seems to rile people up more in regards to the characterization around Dr. Dao's behavior. I just want to kind of go back and kind of get inside your head for how you were trying to walk a line between your relations with your employees and your relations with your customer, and if you feel you got that balance right early in the week and how you kind of felt you need to make a pivot later in the week?","Oscar Munoz","Thanks. Listen, customers have always been first, but I think the evolution of our company, we needed to regain the trust of our employees first before they can do that. And if you think about -- your question about what's in my head and why it was important to support our employees as well as keep customer focus is that customer service at the end of the day, is not about a policy or a procedure or a tool, it's about values, human values, and that we cannot lose because if I lost that with that many thousands -- tens of thousands of employees, we'd be in a very much more difficult situation. So as far as I look at it, it's about values, not protocol.","Operator","And finally from Flightglobal, we have Edward Russell. Please go ahead.","Edward Russell","Andrew, I wanted to ask a bit more about the 12 737 that are purchased off lease. I was wondering if you can break down with the variants are 700, 800, 900 and who the lessors were that you purchased this from?","Andrew Levy","The aircraft were split evenly between 737-700s and 737-800s and the seller was GECAS.","Edward Russell","Great. Thank you very much.","Andrew Levy","Thanks.","Julie Yates Stewart","All right, thanks to all for joining the call today. Please contact Media Relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"21094":["United Continental Holdings, Inc.

Please go ahead.","Irene Foxhall","Thank you, Brandon [ph]. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey. Jeff will begin with some overview comments, after which Jim will discuss revenue and capacity. Greg will follow with an update on our operations. John will then review our cost, fleet and capital structure after which we will open the call for questions, first from analysts and then from the media. We'd appreciate it if you would limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that I'll turn it over to Jonathan Ireland.","Jonathan Ireland","Thanks, Nene. This morning we issued our earnings release and separate investor update, both are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information in this morning's earnings release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represents the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for more throughout description of these factors.","Also, during the course of our call we'll discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures please refer to the tables at end of our earnings release and investor update. Copies of which are available on our website. Unless otherwise noted special charges are excluded as we walk through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Smisek","Thanks, Nene and Jonathan, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Today we reported pre-tax earnings of $1.3 billion, the highest quarterly earnings in United's history. We earned $3.31 per diluted share and produced an 18.2% return on invested capital over the last 12 months.","In the quarter, we generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow and almost $0.5 billion of free cash flow. We put our cash to good use by investing it in our employees and our business, prepaying debt and making significant contributions to our pension plans, buying back stock and investing in strategic partnerships.","Over the past few years, we've made good progress strengthening our balance sheet to derisk the business while also making substantial progress completing our initial $1 billion share repurchase program. Accordingly today we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2017. In addition we now expect to complete our initial $1 billion authorization in the third quarter, almost two years ahead of schedule. Our new share repurchase program demonstrates confidence in our ability to generate and sustain meaningful free cash flow.","Turning to expense, we continue to demonstrate cost discipline, growing second quarter non-fuel unit costs only 0.3%. This excellent cost performance is due in large part to the continuing success of Project Quality, our $2 billion efficiency and quality initiative. Project Quality highlights the dedication and commitment of United's workforce. Our employees continue to discover and implement new ways to improve everything we do and I want to thank them for their efforts to help make our company stronger and more sustainable over the long term.","I'd also like to thank our employees for their commitment and effort managing through a challenging operation in June. Our operational performance was below our expectations in June due to tough weather and a spike in maintenance write ups and we took action to address the maintenance related situation. As a result, we've seen a meaningful improvement in our operations over the past few weeks and Greg will provide further detail in a few minutes. We expect the third quarter to be another good quarter for United financially, and we estimate our pre-tax margin will be between 13.5% and 15.5% driven by continuing cost discipline and lower oil prices.","Although our expected margin performance is muted by the current weak revenue environment for our industry we're making network and capacity decisions to address this weakness with a focus on structuring our network to expand both margins and return on invested capital. Over the last several years we have demonstrated our commitment to matching United's capacity with demand and we will continue to take the appropriate network and capacity actions to deliver value to our shareholders.","In conclusion the second quarter was a very good quarter for United and I am proud of the work our employees have done to deliver record earnings which benefit all our constituencies, including our employees themselves. We have a great deal of confidence in our future as we work to make United the carrier of choice.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, Greg and John.","Jim Compton","Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to thank our customers for flying United. We work hard every day to improve our performance, our product and our network to deliver the choice and experience you desire. In the second quarter our consolidated unit revenue fell 5.6%. The drivers were consistent with our initial expectations, a strong U.S. dollar, the effects of lower oil prices, pressure as a result of margin-accretive initiatives and competitive pricing actions.","While the drivers were unchanged, unit revenue deteriorated throughout the quarter. In particular revenue from our energy-related corporate contracts declined more than we anticipated and the effects of competitive pricing worsened throughout the quarter. Corporate revenue for the second quarter decreased by approximately 5% on roughly flat traffic year-over-year, largely due to a 30% reduction in revenue from oil and gas related corporate customers. We believe this decline has roughly leveled out, and we don't anticipate material deterioration for the remainder of the year. Excluding oil and gas related corporate revenue our corporate revenue was down approximately 2% with traffic volumes up approximately 2% year-over-year.","Ancillary revenue continued to perform well over the second quarter, growing 7% per passenger versus the second quarter of last year. We are now generating more than $23 per passenger in ancillary revenue and remain on track to achieve $3.2 billion of ancillary revenue this year. In the third quarter, we expect our [indiscernible] to decline 5% to 7% on capacity growth of 1.25% to 2.25%. We anticipate international unit revenue will be down [to 11%] [ph] and domestic unit revenue to decline 1% to 3%.","The drivers of our third quarter unit revenue are largely the same as those in the second quarter. We expect the foreign exchange impact to account for 1.5 points of year-over-year PRASM pressure. We anticipate that the impact of lower international surcharges will account for one point of weakness, and that lower oil and gas related corporate revenue will drive nearly one point of PRASM decline. We also expect the current competitive pricing actions will drive another 1.5 points of decline in the quarter. Finally, the margin accretive actions we are taking, such as installing slim line seats and consolidating frequencies through up gauging will drive a half point of unit revenue decline.","As we expect this to be our second consecutive quarter of negative year over year unit revenue performance, we have taken the appropriate actions to minimize this decline. We reduced second half capacity by approximately half a point and now expect full year 2015 consolidated capacity to grow between 1% and 1.5% this year. The capacity reduction largely comes from three markets where we've seen meaningful reduction in demand.","First we further reduced capacity in our Core Energy markets. We have reduced capacity in those markets by 9% in the third quarter and 8% in the fourth quarter. Second, we pulled down capacity into Brazil by 7% in the fourth quarter to help offset the yield weakness driven by the strong U.S. dollar and the weak Brazilian economy. Finally we further reduced our Trans-Atlantic capacity in the fourth quarter. Our Trans-Atlantic capacity will decline approximately 0.5% year over year. The total impact of these changes will result in fourth quarter consolidated capacity of approximately 0.5% to 1.5%, more than 1.5 points lower than we had initially planned.","As we have demonstrated over the last several years United has historically built its capacity to match demand and will continue this practice going forward. We will evaluate further capacity actions based on our expectations for demand as we move into the winter periods.","We continue to improve our network with a focus on enhancing our core strengths. In June we announced our decision to move our p.s. service from JFK to our global gateway at Newark Liberty. With this change we will have the most flat lie-flat seats between New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco of any airline and will now offer our premium p.s. product at our premier New York Hub.","In conclusion while unit revenue performance is down year over year, I am confident we are taking the appropriate steps to address the current challenging demand environment. At United we have a long history of matching capacity to demand and we intend to continue that. Our decision to move our p.s. product out of JFK and into Newark Liberty is one example of how we are prepared to take significant actions for the long-term benefit of our network, our customers, our employees and our shareholders, and we will continue to evaluate other opportunities going forward.","With that, I'll turn it over to Greg.","Greg Hart","Thanks, Jim, and thank to everyone for joining the call this morning. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for the continued hard work and for managing through a difficult operation in June. I'm proud of how you handled the tough conditions by putting our customers first and I appreciate your dedication and professionalism.","Despite a challenging June, our operation has improved materially this year. In fact we have cancelled 24,000 fewer flights during the first half of this year than we did during the same period last year. We also improved our system-wide on time performance by over four points during the same period. This improvement could not have been achieved without the commitment of our experienced team.","With respect to the second quarter, we performed well in April and May, but a difficult June led to second quarter operational performance that did not meet our expectations. One factor was weather. In June we faced thunderstorm activity at one or more of our hubs during 25 of the 30 days of the month. We also experience an increase in maintenance write-ups in the first three weeks of June. We've taken steps to address the maintenance related issues and over the last four weeks we've seen our performance improve materially including a roughly 50% reduction in maintenance cancellations when compared to the first three weeks of June.","Over the past several calls I've talked to you about the investments we've made to better communicate with our customers. During the difficult June period we used these new tools and procedures to more quickly and effectively respond to our customers' needs. For example with these tools we are able to proactively notify customers about disruptions and resolve their issues in a more timely manner than we could have in the past. In addition, by equipping our airport employees with handheld devices and mobile printers, our agents were able to assist thousands of customers throughout the gate area with average transaction times of less than a minute.","In closing while our performance in June did not meet our expectations, we have seen meaningful improvement in our operation year-to-date due to the hard work of employees and the use of new technology. We are committed to doing what it takes to run an even more reliable airline and we are making, and we'll continue to make, the investments to ensure we do so.","With that I'll turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks, Greg, and thanks to everyone for joining the call this morning. I also want to take this opportunity to thank our employees. Today we announced record quarterly earnings in large part due to the commitment and professionalism that our employees bring to the job every day.","Our second quarter pre-tax profit was $1.3 billion with a pre-tax margin of 12.7% and we increased our earnings per share by 41% year-over-year. We achieved a 12 month return on invested capital of 18.2% and generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, net of $620 million of pension contributions. Second quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, was up only 0.3% year-over-year, a result of our continued focus on efficiency and reducing cost.","For the third quarter we expect consolidated CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense to be approximately flat year-over-year. We now expect full year 2015 CASM, again excluding fuel, profit sharing and third-party business expense, to be between flat and up 0.5% despite, again, reducing our expected full year capacity by an additional quarter point.","Project Quality, our $2 billion efficiency and quality initiative continues to play a critical role in our excellent cost performance. Year-to-date we have achieved approximately $350 million in non-fuel savings and expect to realize $800 million for the full year. Based on our progress to date we now expect to achieve our goal of $1 billion in annual non-fuel cost savings by the end of next year, a full year in advance of our initial expectations.","Productivity improvements continue to be a major driver of our Project Quality success. This quarter productivity improved 2.2% over last year, marking eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement.","Turning to fuel expense, we recorded a hedge loss of approximately $200 million in the quarter. For the third quarter we are approximately 20% hedged and based on the July 16 forward curve we expect to incur approximately $230 million in hedge losses while participating in 83% of any future price declines. For the fourth quarter our hedge book is in a loss position of approximately $225 million, and allows us to participate in 77% of any decline in oil prices. Additionally, in the quarter we began building a small hedge position in 2016, marking our first entry into the market since oil prices began to decline late last summer. We will continue to be opportunistic as we consider layering on additional hedge positions.","We expect to generate continued margin expansion and free cash flow in the third quarter with a pre-tax margin between 13.5% and 15.5%. We continue to take a balanced approach to deploying our cash. In the second quarter we prepaid $800 million of debt bringing our year-to-date debt payments to $920 million. Additionally we spent $620 million funding our pension plans in the quarter bringing our total pension funding for the year to $800 million and materially reducing our unfunded-pension liability. Given the progress we've made year to date, we don't anticipate significant additional funding this year.","We also invested in the business with $1.26 billion in capital expenditures and repurchased $250 million of stock. Finally we spent $130 million on two strategic investments. First we invested $100 million to purchase a stake in approximately 5% of Azul Brazilian airlines, a carrier that, over the long term, will strengthen our Latin network and provide United's customers with exclusive connection opportunities throughout Brazil. Second we invested $30 million for an equity stake in Fulcrum BioEnergy, an alternative fuels company. We are excited about each of these equity investments and look forward to these new partnerships.","Along with our second quarter results today we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2017. In addition we intend to complete the remained $230 million of our initial $1 billion authorization in the third quarter of this year, almost two years ahead of schedule. Over the last several quarters we have taken a balanced approach to investing in our employees and the business, paying down debt, funding our pension and repurchasing stock. We have now eliminated all prepayable high-interest rate debt from our balance sheet while also significantly reducing our unfunded pension liability. While there is still more that can be done in these areas, we are excited about our new $3 billion share repurchase authorization.","We also continued investing in our fleet in the second quarter adding six 737-900ERs, one 787-9, three used 737-700s and 15 additional 76-seat Embraer E175 regional aircraft to our fleet. We now have 60 E175s in our fleet and have removed almost 100 50 seaters since the beginning of last year.","In the quarter we announced plans to lease up to 25 used A319s and add 10 to 28 more E175s in 2016 and 2017 bringing the total number of E175s in our fleet to as many as 153 by 2017.","In conclusion, I'm pleased with our record-setting second quarter results, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We will continue to execute on our plan to increase shareholder value as we focus on growing earnings, generating free cash flow, increasing our return on invested capital, and returning cash to shareholders through our new buyback program.","I'll now turn it over to Jonathan to open up the call to questions.","Jonathan Ireland","Thank you, John. First we will take questions from the analyst community. Then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question, and if needed, one follow-up question. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And from Credit Suisse, we have Julie Yates online. Please go ahead.","Julie Yates","Good morning.","Jeff Smisek","Good morning, Julie.","Julie Yates","With the incremental capacity reductions, when do you expect United can get back on a flat to positive unit revenue growth trajectory?","Jim Compton","Hey, Julie. This is Jim. As you're aware, we don't provide guidance beyond the upcoming quarter. We've guided to third quarter rise and decline of about 5% to 7%. But let me talk about some of the factors that we already know that will positively affect the fourth quarter. First in the fourth quarter we'll begin to lap some of the drivers to our current revenue decline. In particular, the strong dollar and some of the effects of the lower oil prices that began in the fourth quarter of last year. As you just said, we have made adjustments to our capacity. And so as we're responsive to adjusting our network to match demand we expect to realize those benefits. But in the end it's a little bit too early to zero in on where the demand will be, particularly on the business side this far out. But we do, as I mentioned, we do some of the factors that will begin to lap in the fourth quarter will be positive in terms of our unit revenue.","Julie Yates","Okay. Understood. Thanks, Jim. And then last week one of your competitors noted 50% of their yield decline was just from three domestic markets. Would you agree or are you seeing more broad based weakness or would you add other cities to those called out that are particularly weak?","Jim Compton","Yeah, Jim again. You know we are seeing - our biggest yield pressures are coming in Dallas. You know some of the similar things with Love Field and so for the pressure that's happened in Dallas as well Chicago that we've talked about in the past. And then in Houston, I'll tie back to my energy comments that we're seeing the impact of that. So I think those are probably the three markets that we're seeing the biggest yield decline.","Julie Yates","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","From JPMorgan we have Jamie Baker on line. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Good morning, everybody. John as it relates to the $3 billion increased authorization, could you just provide some background as to how you arrived at that particular figure, whether you contemplated dividend at any point in your conversation? Just sort of what goalposts you might have established in terms of thinking about the magnitude of the incremental buyback?","John Rainey","Sure, Jamie. Well the magnitude is something we also think about in the timeframe that we expect to accomplish that and we look at both what our expectation about future earnings are and cash flow as well as the other sources of, I guess, draws on that cash. We have been pretty specific about what our intermediate-term debt goal is. We still have a ways to go to accomplish that. Right now we have a gross debt including capitalized leases balance of about $17 billion and the target that we've set out there is $15 billion. So there's still some work to be done there. We also need to continue to invest in our business. We recognize that there's still a lot of things that we can do that are good returns on that cash as we invest improving our operations, providing a better level of customer services and so forth, and giving our employees the tools to do their jobs. So as I talk consistently the allocation of cash flow for us is one about balance and we look \u2013 to answer your question, look at sort of what the cash flow that we're going to generate and then look at how we balance that cash flow and returning our cash to shareholders through a share buyback is part of that.","With respect to dividend, again, there may be a time and place for a divined in our future, but at this point we still believe that returning cash to shareholders, the best way to do that is buying back our own stock.","Jamie Baker","Got it. And as a follow-up, it appears that Boeing Capital again has surplus. Embraer 190 down [indiscernible]. You know, from an MTOW perspective I don't believe these are scope compliant at the express level, but you could fly them at the mainline. Would we be remiss in at least contemplating whether these aircraft could wind up at United which in turn would allow you to put down even more 50 seaters?","John Rainey","We always look at every aircraft that's out there. And you could certainly point to that size aircraft and look at our fleet. And there's perhaps a need to fill that gap. But we are taking into account the economics of that aircraft, the availability of them. And there may at some time in our future be a need to place an order for aircraft of that size, but that's not something we've decided yet.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much, John. Take care.","Operator","From Bank of America we have Andrew Didora on line. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking my question. I guess my first question is for Jim. Outside of the oil industry, how are your corporate volumes trending? And I ask because we've heard a smaller hotel company talk this morning about just being a little more incrementally cautious on the overall demand environment around travel. So just how has your growth been on the corporate side? Has it been decelerating or has it been pretty steady over the last few quarters?","Jim Compton","Hey, Andrew. Jim. It really does come down to two separate stories as you mentioned the oil base and all other. And as I mentioned, clearly we're experiencing pressure on the oil base where we're seeing about 30% declines in revenue in our corporate-related contracts in the energy sector. But if you look at the non-oil based companies, we're actually very pleased with our performance. I think you got a segment though, and I think many of them when we talk to them are [feeling] [ph] the pressure of the strong dollar off of. But in general the demand is still solid. The little bit of softening as GDP forecasts have come down as we've moved through the second to the third quarter, the yields have come down. But the demand's pretty solid in the non-oil area.","Andrew Didora","Okay. Thank you for that. And then I guess my second question is for John. Just in terms of the unit costs continue to come in better than expectations here. And I know you provide a little bit of commentary in your prepared remarks. But I guess going forward from here, what are some of the biggest areas of focus today on the cost side? And where should we be seeing a lot of the cost saves you mentioned be coming through? Thanks.","John Rainey","So with respect to project quality, I would want to emphasize that while we have a specific dollar amount and timeframe associated with this, this is becoming a way of doing business at United. And as we get near completion of this initiative, we will jump right into the next one. We recognize that this is an ongoing improvement process and there's further opportunity. But the main thing I would want to point you to I think in terms of magnitude of opportunity going forward is the cost benefit that we have from restructuring our network. So if you look at the second quarter for example, we increased our average gauge by 7% while reducing our departures by almost 5%. That has a tremendous cost benefit that comes with it as well, and as we've talked about as I said in my prepared remarks, continuing to take planes like the E175 and sitting down more of the 50-seaters there's a continuation of this going forward and you should expect to see that in our cost results.","Andrew Didora","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","From Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Good morning, everybody. John Rainey, a couple questions for you, I think this is the first time you've used the word opportunistic as it related to our hedging program and with all due respect your on to a pretty bad track record of being opportunistic with fuel hedging, so I guess I can interpret that two ways. You're going to try to time the market so you're going to get \u2013 you're going to hedge the same but you're going to try to do it at times where you feel there's value there or you're actually going to hedge a little bit less and just stop the systematic stuff where you're hedging every day, hedge less but maybe buy some hedges where you feel like there's a pullback in the market.","John Rainey","So I'm going to answer the question slightly differently, Hunter. We have had historically what you might describe as more of a mechanistic structure to our hedging where it's sort of been on autopilot, but in periods of extreme volatility like what we've seen in the back half of last year as well as the first part of this year, that's not necessarily the most prudent way to hedge. And given all the bearish signals in the market for the first part of this year we've been reluctant to take out any position in 2015. However when we look out to 2016 and beyond and we look at both the revenue environment, capacity environment and our cost structure, having the ability to lock-in or said differently, reduce the volatility of one of our single largest cost inputs enables us to accomplish so many other things that are really important and create value in the business. And as we look at hedging, despite maybe taking a more opportunistic approach, it's really more of risk management and reducing the volatility with our costs and that enables us to play on things much like what we did today with the $3 billion share repurchase program. So those go hand in hand. If we see a more stable environment with less volatility going forward, we might be able to get back to a hedge program more like what you've seen in the past, but we are looking at particular price that are more attractive. If that's characterized as opportunistic, then so be it at this point.","Hunter Keay","Okay. And then was there a cost benefit, revenues for united are probably going to decline [indiscernible]. Is there a cost benefit to that that maybe goes away next year if revenue stabilizes that should make the CASM performance this year a little bit harder to maintain around the increment assuming roughly some more magnitude to capacity growth?","John Rainey","Is there a cost benefit to, I'm sorry, I didn't follow your question exactly.","Hunter Keay","Sure. Is there a cost benefit to a decline in revenue?","John Rainey","There are revenue-related costs whether it's credit card discount fees, commissions and so forth. But we generally view those as good costs in a business. We much rather focus on the top line growth.","Hunter Keay","Right.","John Rainey","Over the years the magnitude of those has diminished quite a bit. It's much different than it was 15 years ago in this business where they made up a much larger portion of our cost structure.","Hunter Keay","Okay. So the nature of the question was basically is there anything in the CASM this year that should be a little bit harder to maintain next year if revenues don't go down just as much?","John Rainey","Sure. We added, as I mentioned, around distribution perhaps.","Hunter Keay","Yep. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Stifel we have Joseph DeNardi online. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. On the Trans-Atlantic capacity you guys were talking about coming down a little bit in the fourth quarter, is that thing done collectively with your JV partner so that maybe total industry capacity reductions are more than even what you guys are pulling out?","Jim Compton","Hey, Joseph. This is Jim. As we work through our capacity, we're always in dialogue with our joint venture partners so that we can as a group manage through that process in the best way. Our capacity reductions are, as I mentioned, focused on where we think demand is relative to our network. We clearly make that, have those conversations with our partners and share that information as the group works together to manage across the Trans-Atlantic. So the answer is yes. We're tweaking some things. The great thing about our network and our fleet is its flexibility. And so what you're seeing in the Trans-Atlantic is that fleet flexibility going up, allowing us to gauge appropriately to the demand we expect in the fourth quarter.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then John or Jim, have you guys looked at all at implementing any sort of a credit card surcharge? And what would be some of the considerations there?","John Rainey","I wouldn't comment on that at all.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank we have Mike Linenberg online. Please go ahead.","Mike Linenberg","Yeah, hey. Good morning, everyone. Two questions here. John, you did a nice rundown on the fleet. But I didn't hear any mention of the 777 300 ERs. When do you take delivery of them? And then I did hear that you are going to early retire some 7-4s? Can you just touch on that?","John Rainey","We take delivery of the first planes at the end of 2016. And with respect to the 7-4s, there are a couple in our fleet that we will take out, but we'll make a decision about whether the 777s or for that matter that A350s replace the 7-4s a little bit later. We are going to hit a period at the late 2019 time period where a lot of those 7-4s that we have in our fleet come due for a more expensive maintenance visit and that might be a good opportunity to sit them down at that point in time.","Mike Linenberg","Are there any that are going to come out in 2016 2017 or it's a more 2019 decision?","John Rainey","There might be a couple that come out in the earlier years, yes.","Mike Linenberg","Okay, good, and then this question may be it's John or Jim. On the p.s. service you started up in October so that's sort of one action. The second action as it just relates to the slots, I guess the slot swap between you and Delta, what sort of \u2013 do you need any sort of regulatory approval for that or you can just proceed with that and it's a done deal?","Jeff Smisek","This is Jeff. On the slots at Newark we are in discussions with the \u2013 they have trust authorities that relate to that, they have the opportunity to view that and we are in discussions with them but we are highly confident that we will consummate that transaction.","Mike Linenberg","Great. Thanks a lot, Jeff.","Operator","From Cowen we have Helane Becker on line. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi guys, thanks for the time. Just a question on your second quarter salaries and benefits, head count was up just under a half a point and capacity was up 2.3%, but that line item was up over 12% and it was up more than it was up than it was for the year-to-date so was there something special in the second quarter we should know about and then how should we think about that going into the rest of the year?","John Rainey","There's two things I'd point out there, Helane. One is profit sharing and because of our higher pre-tax margin in the second quarter we trigger a higher profit sharing ratio and so that's probably higher than what we have modeled. The other thing, we continue to see pressure both with respect to pensions as well as medical and dental. We saw a lot of pressure last year and we're seeing a lot of cost increase in those areas this year as well.","Helane Becker","Is that because you have an older workforce?","John Rainey","There's a lot of reasons that go into that and certainly the tenure of your workforce is one of them.","Helane Becker","Okay, and then can you just update us on your unfunded liability? Thanks.","John Rainey","If we were to look at our contributions to date, without making adjustments for any actuarial assumptions or anything like that, which need to be done, we're actually at about $1 billion of an unfunded liability. That's obviously subject to change when we measure that at year-end but it puts us in a very good position over the next several years as we think about that like any other debt obligation. We've said before, we want to get to a point where if we were to get in an interest rate environment where rates are higher than they are today, we can get close to fully funded, and we are effectively in that position right now.","Helane Becker","That's great. Thanks so much for your time. I appreciate it.","John Rainey","You're welcome.","Operator","From Buckingham Research, we have Dan McKenzie online. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks.","John Rainey","Hey, Dan.","Dan McKenzie","John, regarding the 18% return on invested capital over the past 12 months, how does that break down domestically versus internationally? And I'm guessing international worse, domestic better, but what is that gap? And then as you think, say, the international, is the fix on the international side just as simple as the U.S. dollar stabilizing against other currencies? Or are you thinking that beyond this year perhaps bigger steps might be required?","John Rainey","Well, let me first take the return on invested capital piece. As you can appreciate, we have fungible assets and it's pretty difficult to take a 777 that may fly domestically and also fly internationally and allocate that capital base between the two. So we don't look at return on invested capital on an international versus domestic basis. If you were to look at just NOPAP [ph], the numerator, certainly you've seen a better balance today that what we've seen historically where a lot of the profitability from airlines came \u2013 at least from the airlines that I've been associated with \u2013 came from the international portion. The domestic environment is a very good one right now and happens to be a very profitable one as well.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Very good. And then I guess just following up with a second question here. Holding steel prices constant, how are you thinking about the medium-term margin goals? And how far along are we on the trajectory versus the November 2013 Investor Day.","John Rainey","I would say, Dan, we're probably a little bit more than halfway through it, if you could all of the various initiatives that we outlined. Certainly we've had a little quicker pace with respect to our cost achievements but we recognize that we still have a lot of work to do here and we're pleased with the progress. A lot is made of core earnings improvement versus last year and it's certainly very difficult to strip out oil without acknowledging that there's some effect on revenue as well. So we tend to focus on the things that we can measure. The fact that we've improved productivity for eight quarters, the fact that we've cancelled 24,000 fewer flights for the first part of this year. We had one of the highest completion factors of the major carriers coming out of Newark, the fact that our cost performance continues to improve quarter-after-quarter. And all those are good indications of the progress that we were making, and we feel like we've got a good plan that we're executing on. We'll continue to demonstrate that performance.","Dan McKenzie","Fantastic. Thanks, guys.","Operator","From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth online. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to Mike's question about moving your Transcon flights from JFK to Newark, can you talk about the profit improvement that you expect from that move?","Jim Compton","Hey, Duane, this is Jim. We would obviously, not that we won't talk about this profit, I will tell you, we're really excited. I mean if you think about the PS product United had for long history in that product of serving our customers with that premium service and the ability to introduce it to really the premier hub in New York, at Newark Liberty and offer from L.A. and San Francisco every flight flatbed seat, we're very excited about it and what the results will be on that. In addition to, if you're leaving from L.A. or you're leaving from San Francisco and you're going over the Europe, you'll have that flatbed experience across your whole journey and so forth. So I won't disclose profit but I will tell you, we're very excited about the move. We think this is really incremental to our net worth. As I mentioned, we think it's terrific for the long term for our product, our customers, our employees and obviously, our shareholders.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. And then can you comment a little bit about what you're seeing in China right now. Obviously, that's been a competitive market for you, and you focus more on less competitive long-haul service there. But can you comment on any specific demand trend changes that you're seeing to that market?","Jim Compton","This is Jim again. We obviously continue to see the significant capacity in this region. But again, as I mentioned, our history there, our position there, we're very happy with and happy with the performance. China runs at a very high level and so forth. China is such an important market to us, given our footprint there. We also take the long view of it. We're really confident where we see demand today even in today's environment. And although that capacity growth is strong, that demand will come in line over the next several years and so forth. Working with our network guys, if you look at areas that capacity is growing and that RASM pressure is on it, the demand side in China today actually puts less pressure to razz them than the other markets that are growing. So it's really that demand catching up to the capacity levels there. And we think over the next five years, and again, given as you mentioned, our ability to fly to secondary cities and so forth with our fleet in the 787, we're really well positioned to do well there.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. So if I could just summarize what you said, the competitive capacity is still an issue. But in terms of end market demand, you haven't really seen an incremental change to the downside?","Jim Compton","Yes. Yeah. The demand is still growing. Clearly obviously not at the 20% capacity we've seen. But again, the long-term view on demand for capacity has continued to grow at a pretty good rate.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks. And then just lastly, John, on pensions. Can you just help us think about the implication of your improved funding status? What do you expect cash funding to be going forward? Next year? And how much could this be a cost tailwind into 2016? Thanks for taking the questions.","John Rainey","I would describe it less as a cost tailwind and more of a cash flow tailwind. So year-to-date we've funded $800 million. Going forward, this would probably be a rounding error in your model. You could see us fund somewhere between $50 million to $150 million a year. But there's not a need to have a big catch-up contribution like what we have this year. Again, everything else being equal, given what we know today.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","From Barclays, we have David Fintzen online. Please go ahead.","David Fintzen","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on some of the Atlantic comments. Is there any reasons within Atlantic in Europe specifically that are requiring more capacity adjustments? Or is it a broader reduction across the network?","Jim Compton","Hey, David. This is Jim. I think the Trans-Atlantic as it relates obviously to foreign exchange makes it a broad breadth impact in terms of demand and so forth. That being said, we are seeing good premium traffic into the U.K. and so forth. But if you think about it, remember that foreign exchange has really affected our offshore point of sale. And in the third quarter period of time, it's seasonally the point of sale out of Europe is one of the better periods of time during the year. At the same time, that stronger dollar, our expectations to drive higher U.S. point of sale because of the stronger dollar, although we've seen an uptick, it's not at the level of expectations that we originally thought. So it's really more broad-based and so forth. And in addition to the capacity reductions that we made over the course of the year out of Scandinavia and so forth, Norway, Sweden and we've adjusted some of our capacity down there. So if there was a reason we probably seen it more there, but generally it's across the board in Europe.","David Fintzen","Okay. And presumably it's harder to shift point-of-sale in off-peak 4Q than it would be through the summer?","Jim Compton","Yeah. You know, again, I'm a big believer \u2013 we chase demand, right? And off-peak periods demand softer and so you could reach that conclusion and so forth. But the U.S. point-of-sale growth from the stronger dollar still hasn't reach the level based on what we anticipated earlier in the year.","David Fintzen","Okay. That's helpful. And this is a little bigger picture question. In terms of all the refleeting efforts, which is obviously important cost initiatives, does that add or subtract from flexibility to adjust capacity? And does that give you more levers to pull in the timing of those pieces?","John Rainey","Well I would say one of our main focuses that we've had for a number of years right now is to preserve fleet flexibility to be able to respond to any type of economic environment. And if you look at the composition of our fleet today of roughly 700, 710 mainline planes, 22% of that fleet is free and clear of debt unencumbered. We could sit down in any type of economic environment and we want to continue to preserve that going forward. In fact, as you see us finance less of new aircraft and in some cases buy aircraft entirely for cash, that preserves that flexibility, because what we don't want is to be in an environment where we want to adjust capacity but we're still have to cover the cash cost of those planes.","Jim Compton","And David, I would just add \u2013 this is Jim. I think actually one of the flexibilities that it does add for us is in the area of range. And so we're able to kind of look at different markets based on the range we're getting through the refleeting we're happening. And on the other side also is the fact that it drives new revenue opportunities within [indiscernible].","David Fintzen","Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate all that.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley we have Rashiv Lalani [ph] on the line. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the comments you made about the domestic environment and some of the competitive behavior. Do you feel like the aggressiveness, I guess, is leveling out or do you see the potential for that to maybe increase and spread beyond the couple of cities that you touched on?","Jim Compton","Yeah, as I mentioned I talked to a couple of the cities, Dallas, Huston, Chicago where we're seeing most the pressure. We're looking at a 1% to 3% decline in consolidated domestic in the third quarter, as I guided to. In the second quarter that was down 3.6% and so I think the team's doing a terrific job of managing what is a softer demand environment that quite frankly creates lower price points and we're meeting that demand. And so I'm thinking the domestic relative basis is more stable and that actually our guidance relative to the second quarter shows that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then just another question, John, maybe coming back to some of the comments you made on the cost side. You talked about a lot of the opportunities that are ahead of you, but how does labor come into play just given what we've seen on pilot agreements and what you've got open in front of you on flight attendance, et cetera.","John Rainey","We have in our cost guidance this year, we've provided for 2015, there is an assumption about getting agreements with the last two remaining groups out of the 30 collectively bargain agreements completed, and I think importantly for us, but that goes both ways. So there's also a cost benefit to the company of getting those collective bargaining agreements, but more importantly, we want to get everybody under a joint contract and moving forward. There's a big sort of cultural morale piece to that as well that we're very focused on. So hopefully, we'll complete those agreements in the near future.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just longer term as we think about the pilot side maybe?","John Rainey","Well, we've said consistently that we need to run this business where we can keep our unit cost growth at something less than inflation, and that includes all of the cost inputs including labor. We certainly want to pay our employees competitive wages that are market-based and that goes into that assumption, but to the extent that we've got inflation pressure in certain areas, like that perhaps, we're going to offset it in other ways by becoming more efficient and more productive.","Unidentified Analyst","Very helpful. Thank you.","John Rainey","Yep.","Operator","And our last question from Goldman Sachs, we have Tom Kim. Please go ahead.","Tom Kim","Hi. Jim, I wanted to follow up on your China strategy. Can you talk about like what opportunities you may have to form strategic partnerships with the Asians as you've done in Europe and now recently in Latin America?","Jim Compton","In terms of our alliances and so forth, as we think about China, clearly envisioning we have a terrific partner in Air China, and to the level that we're allowed to in terms of how we can expand our net worth by connecting and creating more connections for our customers and expanding our footprint there. And we'll continue to do that and look for opportunities with our Star partners to do that and at the same time, obviously, complement that with what we think is a terrific strategy given our fleet, the 787, the ability to fly secondary cities such as Chengdu from San Francisco and so forth, as well as build on our core markets in both Beijing and Shanghai. So the answer is like Latin America, as John mentioned, expanding our network with Azul, we'll continually look for opportunities that are growth markets, and clearly China is, and ways to expand our presence and our footprint in the market.","Jeff Smisek","This is Jeff, Tom. The one thing I would add to what Jim said is, as you know, China is not open skies. But there will come a day when China is open skies and when that day comes, we would be keenly interested in exploring a joint venture similar to the type of joint venture that we enjoy with A&A today across the Pacific and that we enjoy with Lufthansa and other of our partners, Air Canada and others, across the Atlantic.","Tom Kim","Good stuff. We obviously understand that the Chinese are building up their network from the trans-Pac and I'm wondering which inning do you think they're at. Basically, we're trying to size up when we should anticipate trans-Pac capacity slowing?","Jim Compton","Yeah. That's a great question. I think to begin, the industry as demand grows, capacity is going to grow. I think expectations for demand growth in China, clearly we believe are strong and long term and so forth. It would be difficult for me to put a level of that but I think where demand grows, you're going to see capacity grow. I think as I mentioned earlier, we're really well positioned.","Tom Kim","Okay. If I can just squeeze in one more. Just to follow-on an earlier question about fuel. And this is really for John or Jim. I'm curious about your risk management strategy, particularly around fuel. Quite candidly, if it were not for lower fuel prices, the airline industry profits would be done and obviously for your company as well, not up. And this is in spite of all of your successes in containing non-fuel CASM growth. And obviously pricing is going to be whatever the market is willing to pay but I'm wondering how are you thinking about earnings risk if the consensus viewer of a lower for longer fuel environment doesn't happen? If we go back to last year, I don't think any of us thought fuel was going to drop suddenly the way that it did in the second half. We all know fuel is really volatile and it could obviously go the other way. I'm just wondering given the consensus view is that fuel is lower for longer, how are you thinking about the biggest risk to your earnings expectations? And related to that, how quickly can you respond should fuel suddenly sort of spike unexpectedly?","John Rainey","First of all, I disagree with the way you characterize that slightly because to say that \u2013 to just look at the impact of fuel and not understand that fuel also impacts the revenue environment I think only looks at one side of the equation there. A lot of the headwinds that Jim talked about earlier are certainly very related to fuel. Even if we take the foreign exchange headwind that we've seen, that's due to a stronger dollar. A stronger dollar has in part influenced the price of fuel. So we're seeing a lot of pressure year over year. As we move long term though and we look at an environment that potentially could have lower fuel inputs than what we've seen, we're going to update United Airlines. We're going to focus on what we can control and that's balancing the right amount of capacity for the demand in our markets.","Tom Kim","Fair enough. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Reuters we have [Indiscernible] on line. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much for taking the question. What steps has United taken in recent weeks, if any, to ensure that diverse technological issues do not cause more system-wide ground stops which is adding redundancy?","Jeff Smisek","Sure, Jeffrey. This is Jeff. I'm glad we enjoy the same first name. First of all we had an item that was disruptive that lasted about two hours that was a network connectivity issue. We recognize the inconvenience to our customers and the inconvenience to our employees. Our employees responded very well. Our IT people responded very well, got the system back up. In fact a lot of the tools that Greg talked about that we've invested in also the many of which are technology tools, decision-making tools actually permitted us to have a really good operations start-up the next day despite that disruption.","I will tell you that the technology is our single largest area of non-aircraft CapEx. A lot of that goes to the operation itself, providing better tools and better decision-making tools as well. We're investing in hardware. We're investing in software. We're investing in the people and the processes to recover from irregular operations, because those are always going to occur because of weather or, for example, some kind of a maintenance issue with an airplane. We're focused very heavily on investing in the reliability of our systems and I can assure our customers that that investment will continue and that we're very focused on not only improving the stability, but actually offering additional technology to our customers to permit them to have better information, better choices better control of their travel, and for our employees that will permit them to do their jobs better.","For example we're issuing 2,200 iPhone 6 Pluses to our flight attendants and over time as we add to those iPhones, our flight attendants will have vastly better information than they've had before and better interaction with their customers and can be better opportunity to serve our customers. So we're keenly focused. No one likes to have a technology outage. It can happen at any company. It happened to happen to us on a day that, of course, there was a lot of media excitement around the New York Stock Exchange.","But I can tell you we are keenly focused on improving our technology, improving the stability of our technology, and more importantly, as you obviously have to have stability. Stability, to me, is like safety in an airline. You have to have this job, one, but improving the quality of our technology for our customers and the quality of our technology for our employees. And both those things are really important. And we are keenly focused on it, and we are spending a significant amount of both time and money and bandwidth to get that accomplished.","Unidentified Analyst","Well, thank you so much. And just to clarify, because it's unclear where a technological issue can occur, is it difficult to really target those investments? Do the investments need to be general?","Jeff Smisek","Well, no. Not necessarily. We know areas, for example, where we can beef up systems or beef up backups. And so we know where to look. We also obviously do invest in significant amount, a significant amount of time and attention to the network itself and all the connectivity of the network, and of course, as all companies do today. We have very sophisticated investments in cyber security as well. So I think we know exactly where we're going and what we need to invest in.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you. And I'm so sorry. Just last follow-up then. So since you have pinpointed those areas, have you started those particular investments? Or do you have at least plans already to start those investments?","Greg Hart","Oh, you bet. We've already started. We have regular investments. We have a system-wide program we call Refresh in terms of improving all of the backbone of the system, the connectivity of the system. And again, continuing to improve Wi-Fi bandwidth and coverage because so much of our future and so much of our obviously the customer usage, but our own usage particularly at airports and onboard airplanes is Wi-Fi related. And we have very significant not only investments but processes going on today to continue to upgrade and improve our technology.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you so much.","Greg Hart","You bet.","Irene Foxhall","Okay. With that, we're out of time. So we'll conclude.","Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call media relations if you have any further questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, investor update and presentation, copies of which are available on our website.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results and outlook, our Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy. In addition, we have Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart, in the room, available to assist with Q&A.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Mike. Good morning everybody and thank you for being on the call today. Before I go on to our first quarter results, I would like us to take a moment and just keep all the passengers and crew of Southwest Flight 1380 in our thoughts. I know that the entire United family stands shoulder to shoulder with our Southwest colleagues in this difficult time.","As we turn to slide four, yesterday we reported adjusted pretax earnings of $179 million with pretax margin of 2% as adjusted. We achieved the top end of our guidance due to a strong demand environment and robust revenue trend, particularly in our international markets. Our earnings per share of $0.50 as adjusted, was 19% higher than our first quarter results of last year.","Our first quarter reflects exceptional operational performance in the face of back-to-back winter storms in the Northeast, as well as other various weather events. And not only did our employees power through these challenges, they continue to deliver record-setting operational performance. I want to thank all 90,000 of our employees for their outstanding work and dedication to keep our airline running not only safe but on time.","Every day, every flight, our team is focused on delivering a positive experience for our customers throughout their journey. We\u2019re equipping our employees with the modern tools and support they need to provide our customers with best possible travel experience.","As you can see on slide five, this quarter, we completed the rollout of 10,000 mobile devices for our airport agents who support gate functions such as rebooking during irregular operations, applying the upgrade, coordinating family seating and many other tasks. These tools not only help our employees and customers but help drive efficiency, something we are extremely focused on.","During the quarter, we also began training our team on United\u2019s customer service decision framework developed alongside our frontline employees, we call this the core4. It is a hierarchical framework based on principles of safe, caring, dependable and efficient. Biggest change is that caring is second only to safety. And what that means is giving our employees the flexibility and more importantly the ownership to take actions for our customers when our policies and procedures don\u2019t fit the situation in hand.","Early results evident in our customer satisfaction scores were very positive and we\u2019re on track to have 80% of our employees complete this core4 training by the end of the year. As you know, improving customers service and experience is one of the top priorities for us here at United.","At our January 23rd investor event, we laid out a three-year plan to deliver a CAGR and earnings per share of about 25%, as shown on slide six. To execute on this plan, we have two primary focus areas. First is strengthening and growing our domestic network; and second is driving asset efficiency and productivity, which is underpinned by our commitment to keep CASM-ex flat or better through 2020.","We have tremendous network potential and have defined and aligned on the strategy design to unlock our opportunities to better leverage what we call our uniquely United strength. We\u2019re very confident in our multiyear network growth strategy and remain committed to the long-term financial targets we laid out in January. In fact, we\u2019ve seen early successes on many of our new routes. That said, we believe the strongest evidence that the plan is working is our march towards our adjusted EPS targets. Despite the recent increases in fuel, today, we\u2019re tightening our full year 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.50 based on the combination of our first quarter results and our increased confidence in the remainder of the year. Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is now $7 to $8.50.","We\u2019re entering the second quarter with the momentum, encouraged by trends in the revenue environment and how our employees continue to raise the bar on operational performance and customer service. And so with that, I will turn it over to Scott. ","Scott Kirby","Thank you, Oscar, and thanks everyone for joining us today. To begin, I would like to thank all of our employees for delivering another quarter of top tier operational performance. We set our best-ever first quarter consolidated D0 with March marking the seventh month in a row of being first amongst our primary competitors. We believe that D0 really is the best measure of an airline\u2019s core operating performance and I\u2019m proud to be a part of this leading team.","And we are running a great operation, getting customers through their destination on time with their bags, with the minimum amount of hassle. The essential requirement to being a customer centric airline, it clearly isn\u2019t enough. We at United have to do much more to run an on-time airline. Empowering our frontline to put customers first, use their judgment really is one of the keys to making United great in the long-term. That\u2019s the reason why you hear all of us talk about the core4 training as such a critical element of our plans here at United. The core4 represents not just some flavor of the day corporate seat but a real necessity to change our DNA and put the customers first.","Moving onto revenue environment. All regions performed above expectations for the quarter, both business and leisure bookings did well domestically and the front-cabin drove outperformance in our international business. [Ph] A healthy revenue environment coupled with the commercial initiatives, Andrew Nocella will touch on shortly, got 2018 off to a strong start. Running a great operation allows us to focus on executing our network strategy to strengthen and grow our hubs.","On slide 10, we have tightened our full-year capacity guidance to 4.5% to 5.5% from the previous quarter\u2019s 6%. In addition, it seems there may be some misunderstandings about scope relative to our three-year growth plan that I\u2019d like to take a moment try to clear up. We believe changing scope and giving a regional product that is competitive is important to United\u2019s long-term future. However, it takes time to negotiate a new agreement, then takes time to negotiate an aircraft deal, and then it takes 18 months or more before the first aircraft are built and start actually flying. So, while it is important to the long run competitive position at United, there really was never enough time for us to get all of that done and aircraft delivered to have a meaningful change in our regional fleet before 2020. So, our targets through 2020 were not and are not predicated on changes to scope. We have great confidence in our $11 to $13 adjusted EPS target but it is based on our existing fleet plan.","We are pleased with how the year began, but as we look forward to the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on running a great operation, executing the growth plans, and increasing our efficiency and productivity. We also know that we have more to do for the customer experience, which is represented by our core4. We feel really good about the demand environment overall and we more specifically for how that revenue outlook is shaping up here at United. And while we are doing everything we can to drive revenue performance, our cost base is the lever that we can most control. And doing so, it\u2019s fundamental to improving our earnings profile. Andrew Levy will talk more about our cost performance and our opportunities going forward, and I\u2019d like to thank him and the entire United team for their hard work in the first quarter to keep us in the middle of our guidance range despite the significant impact of storms.","We feel encouraged about how the first quarter came in and are optimistic about the next couple of quarters that we have visibility on. It\u2019s early but based on everything that we can see so far, gives us increasing confidence that we are on the right path with the growth plan.","Before I turn it over, I\u2019d also like to congratulate Mr. Leskinen who has a baby due tomorrow and assure his Melissa that we will rush into the airport after this call to make sure he gets home in time. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the Andrews.","Andrew Nocella","Thanks, Scott. Turning to the revenue environment on slide 13. Our system PRASM was 2.7% higher year-over-year for the first quarter. As Scott mentioned, all regions exceeded initial expectations with close in strength materialize in the week before Easter holiday, which has been historically weak. We also had a 50 basis-point tailwind from foreign exchange in the quarter. Domestic unit revenue sequentially improved throughout the quarter with corporate revenues being up 9% year-over-year, led by the energy sector. This outpaced our top line growth of 6%. As a result of an intensified competitive landscape and corporate pricing, particularly in the small and medium enterprise segment, we invested in sales initiatives that have sharpened our competitive position across all sectors, geographies and the entire fare spectrum.","The Atlantic region had our strongest year-over-year PRASM of any region in the quarter. We saw sequential improvement each month in the quarter and now have seen improvement for six consecutive quarters. This positive year-over-year PRASM momentum is driven by strong performance in the economy cabin and we continue to see strong revenue performance upfront, as well as a 2-point benefit from foreign exchange. Overall, forward-looking trends show the second quarter looks promising with anticipated continued strength in demand for both cabins.","Latin followed in performance with the bulk of the strength driven by the Caribbean beach markets and Central America, both of which had double digit PRASM growth in the quarter. After 13 quarters of underperformance in the Pacific, PRASM inflected strongly positive in the month of March with demand catching up to supply. China PRASM improved throughout the quarter. Excluding Micronesia, our Transpac PRASM would have been positive in Q1. Looking ahead, we anticipate second quarter PRASM to be up 1% to 3% year-over-year.","Moving to slide 14, I\u2019d like to give an update on some of our commercial initiatives we outlined at our investor event earlier this year. At the end of the first quarter, Gemini, our new revenue management system is rolled out on all flights and we expect Gemini to be running in all cabins by the end of this month. Initial results are on plan and show better managed place as measured by a more optimal mix of medial [ph] fares. I\u2019m really proud of the team and we believe these preliminary results are encouraging and represent the opportunity we can expect Gemini to drive moving forward.","Our Basic Economy product continues to evolve and is currently available for purchasing about two thirds of our domestic non-stop markets. Now, that it\u2019s begun to mature and is competing with similar products from our large competitors, Basic Economy is contributing as we hoped with 60% to 70% of our customers buying up to standard. While there is still room for further optimization, it\u2019s been an effective competitive tool.","In November, we began offering dynamic pricing for Everyday Awards for our MileagePlus members. Since making this announcement, we have seen a 16% increase in saver awards. This allows MileagePlus to offer lower price awards to members while at the same time optimizing award expense to United. On the MileagePlus card, new card acquisitions continue to build on strong fourth quarter performance, and we\u2019ve reached an inflection point with the 7% increase in acquisitions in the quarter. This is the largest number of new accounts in the quarter since the second quarter of 2016. Card spend was up 3%, which we view as a significant opportunity for further growth. We will continue to work with Chase to grow card acquisitions and improve the programs to make it better for our joint customers.","Another customer enhancement is WiFi. We\u2019re bringing Viasat\u2019s latest generation in-flight entertainment and connectivity system to the 70 air craft, including our Boeing 737 MAX. This system is designed to provide customers with fast, reliable internet connections and to be able to connect with key business applications such as corporate, VPN and secure email.","Moving on to Polaris, on slide 15, we remain on track with our aircraft reconfiguration schedule. We plan to induct a Polaris-configured aircraft every 10 days through the end of 2020. We are very excited about Polaris and continue to invest and improve the soft product in response to customer and employee feedback. We\u2019re currently on schedule to open four Polaris lounges this year with San Francisco opening in just a few days at the end of this month and New York and Houston in one more month and Los Angeles later this year.","In summary, we feel the revenue environment is robust and as strong as we have seen in long time. Our commercial initiatives have taken off in the right direction. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Andrew.","Andrew Levy","Thanks, Andrew. Yesterday afternoon, we released our first quarter 2018 earnings and our second quarter investor update. I will discuss both our results and outlook at a high level, and please refer to those documents for additional detail. Slide 17 is a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 18 shows our adjusted results.","We are pleased to report adjusted earnings of $0.50 per share, which was 19% higher than the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted pre-tax income was $179 million and adjusted pre-tax margin was 2%. We were very pleased with how the quarter came in compared to initial expectations. Slide 19 shows our total cost per ASM for the first quarter of 2018 and our estimates for the second quarter and full year.","Turning to slide 20, non-fuel unit costs in the first quarter increased 0.6% on a year over year basis, which is slightly above the middle of our initial guidance range despite the impact from weather events which cumulatively added 40 bps of non-fuel CASM ex-headwind in the quarter.","We expect second quarter non-fuel CASM ex to be between flat to up 1% compared to the second quarter of 2017. The combination of higher regional capacity expense and increased airport costs represents almost 2 points of CASM ex pressure. But, we expect these will largely offset -- these will be largely offset year over year by lower unit costs in other line items. It\u2019s important to note, these were known areas of cost pressure for the second quarter when we provided our 2018 cost guidance in January.","We also expect to see a nice decline in CASM ex during the second half of the year which we get into on slide 21. During the third quarter of 2017, we started to ramp up our 50-seat flying, so as we get into the back half of the year, we start to lap these costs. This alone is expected to provide a half point of CASM ex tailwind compared with the first half of this year. Our capacity growth rate is also expected to be meaningfully higher in the last two quarters with much of the increased rate of growth driven by flying during off-peak periods. As we discussed in January, we believe increasing the productivity of our fixed costs will have a very positive effect on helping container growth of non-fuel unit costs in 2018.","We\u2019ve also launched several initiatives to drive increased cost savings as the year progresses. These include our supply chain excellence projects, which will improve the efficiency of our aircraft part supply chain, and several projects in our maintenance planning area which will improve our airframe heavy maintenance programs and further optimize our checks.","Finally, we\u2019re continuing to utilize our balance sheet by purchasing aircraft off lease, which optimizes our aircraft ownership costs. All in all, I\u2019m very confident in reaffirming our non-fuel unit cost guidance of down 1% to flat for the full year 2018.","Turning to slide 22, year to date through April 16th, we have purchased $747 million of our shares, which represents about 4% of the total shares outstanding at the end of 2017. That leaves us with $2.3 billion remaining of the $3 billion repurchase authority granted by our Board in December of 2017. We plan to continue to opportunistically return excess cash to shareholders through repurchases of our stock when it\u2019s trading below our view of intrinsic value while maintaining appropriate liquidity. For 2018, we continue to expect adjusted CapEx to be between $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion.","On fleet, we took delivery of two Boeing 777-300ERs and four Boeing 787-9s in the first quarter. We also continued to advantage of our balance sheet and purchased six mainline and 17 regional aircraft off of lease, which gives us greater flexibility and better economics for our fleet. Looking forward to the second quarter, we plan to take delivery of our first six Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft and are scheduled to being operating the aircraft in June. We\u2019re very excited about the efficiency improvements and customer experience enhancements this aircraft will bring to our fleet.","We also continue to be very active in the used aircraft market and recently secured a deal for 20 Airbus A319 aircraft scheduled to be delivered to us in 2020 and 2021. Used aircraft provide us an enhanced opportunity to maximize returns regardless of where we\u2019re in the economic cycle. And we\u2019re in discussions for more used widebody and narrowbody aircraft.","Slide 23 includes the summary of our current guidance including second quarter\u2019s projected fuel price range using the April 12th fuel curve. The range provided for capacity, revenue and costs imply the second quarter adjusted pretax margin between 9% and 11%. And as Oscar mentioned earlier, on slide 24, we are raising the bottom end of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.50 to a new range of $7 and $8.50. The momentum we\u2019ve established in the first quarter has increased our confidence in our ability to deliver adjusted EPS in this tightened range.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike to kick off the Q&A.","Mike Leskinen","Thank you, Andrew. First, we will take questions from analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead. ","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, guys, thanks for the time, good quarter. Scott or Andrew Nocella, thanks for the color on the scope constraint. I guess, the other constraint to your growth that I\u2019ve been wondering about is on airport asset. Do you have enough spare gate and runway availability to execute your growth plan at the Mid-Continent hub, or do you need to go on and get more?","Andrew Nocella","For the most part, we have what we need. Really when you look at our schedule, the fact is the airline operated, bank structures where one or two of the banks were completely full through the day but the rest of the banks structures, the rest of the day had excess capacity. So, as we fill in the capacity in the other time today, really obviously very cost efficient, we don\u2019t need incremental gates across most of our hubs and we\u2019re able to grow there on.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay, great. And then, I guess on kind of a similar topic. My sense is that you have some room to grow at Dulles perhaps more than anywhere else, but that wasn\u2019t really a focus when you rolled out your network plan back in January. And so, I guess, I was just wondering if there is room to drive more connections over Dulles specifically, because my sense is that you\u2019d like to refocus more towards the local market.","Andrew Nocella","So, Dulles is a great hub. It operates four departure waves per day today and only one of those departure waves is full from a gate perspective. So, there is a lot of opportunity in Dulles. We continue to evaluate exactly how to take advantage of that but we are excited about all of our hubs and Dulles is one of those hubs, and I do think there is opportunity to grow Dulles in the future.","Darryl Genovesi","And then Andrew Levy, on the CASM guidance, it looks like you need about 200 basis points deceleration in the second half of the year to get to the full year midpoint. Can you just help us bucket what some of the big moving pieces are? If you could help quantify it, that would be helpful.","Andrew Levy","Well, I think, the big pieces are the ones I have referred to that are on slide 21. The 50-seater alone is 0.5 point improvement in the second half relative to the first. We are growing -- substantially more in the back half of the year, you can see that from our capacity and as we noted, the decent amount of that growth is coming during off-peak periods and that\u2019s a very, very low marginal cost. So that\u2019s a cost saving that we will see in the large number of our P&L, income statement line items.","And then, as far as some of the things that I specifically mentioned, I don\u2019t want to give you actual numbers on what the value of those are. However, they are accelerating as the year goes on. For instance, the supply chain excellence project is something we\u2019re really excited about, spent a lot of time planning at the end of last year. And we are just beginning to ramp that up that\u2019s going to deliver benefits to us we think more so as time goes on, including more in the next year. Aircraft rent expense is something that we continue to see some goodness there as we have shifted more airplanes on the balance sheet. So, we will continue to see some benefits there. So, beyond that, I\u2019m not sure how much more detail we want to give you right now but we feel really confident that the combination of these items that I have mentioned as well as several others that are less impactful are going to help us drive our CASM ex meaningfully lower in the second half of the year. And that\u2019s why we are so confident reaffirming the full year guidance.","Operator","From Cowen, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","So, my first question is this. When you think about the first quarter, historically that\u2019s been your toughest quarter. And now you have two years in a row where you actually have profits in this year, I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly significant. As you think about -- or as we I guess think about sequentially fourth quarter to first quarter going forward, is this the new bar, are we going to see more profit in that first quarter going forward than historically United has seen?","Scott Kirby","Helane, I think -- thank you for saying that. We felt really good about how the first quarter came in this year. The fourth and first quarters will always be seasonally the weakest for United and this is simply a fact that we don\u2019t have as much service to Florida and Caribbean. And so, the big exit from the Northeast to Florida and the Caribbean during the winter is less impactful to United as two other airlines. You are seeing improvement in those quarters, I think you will continue to, but I think you are going to see improvement at United across all quarters. We think the kinds of improvement that we saw in the first quarter are going to continue to happen in each quarter. So, it happens in the first quarter but we would expect that to be happening in subsequent quarters as well, including our seasonal peaks, the second and third quarter.","Helane Becker","Right. And so just to follow-up the holidays then our less impactful for you than it might have been in the past years or they might be for other carriers, is that sort of accurate?","Scott Kirby","I think there probably is similar level of impact that for us that they were in past years but we -- they are less impactful for United than they are for example with carrier that has less [ph] service in the Northeast to Florida, particularly the Easter holiday. It has an impact, certainly on our domestic network, the first quarter is helped by it and the second quarter will be a harder comparison but the magnitude is much smaller than other carriers.","Helane Becker","And then, just for my follow-up real quick, I want to understand the Pacific, because I think Andrew Nocella, you said 1% to 3% after you talked about the Pacific, but you were talking about 1% to 3% unit revenue for the system, right, and not for the Pacific specifically in the second quarter? ","Andrew Nocella","That\u2019s what I was referring to.","Helane Becker","Yes, okay. And then, Pacific do you think will be positive on the full quarter basis than this quarter, is that what you said?","Andrew Nocella","I think it will be; our outlook shows that right now.","Operator","From Sanford Bernstein, we have David Vernon. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Scott, I was wondering if you might be able to add a little bit of color as to when kind of getting resolution on the scope issues is going to be important to executing the growth strategy and what the future might look like, if you can\u2019t get the kind of negotiated agreement on that issue that you are looking for right now? ","Scott Kirby","The long-term here at United, we are focused on making this the best airline in the world. And part of that is about having a competitive product and a competitive fleet. I also understand the reluctance our clients have historically had on scope because we were taking regional aircraft and lying them in big markets that appropriately should have been mainline markets, places like Newark, Atlanta, Chicago to Laguardia, Dallas to Chicago. And for the next several years -- for the timing reasons that I talked about or at least through 2020 we never anticipated a change in our fleet plan, it\u2019s just not time to get it done. In the near term, we are funding our growth plan by taking the regional jets out of markets like Newark to Atlanta and moving them into appropriate regional markets. And it is important to making this best airline in the world that we ultimately get that done. There is no ticking clock or no urgent timeline. We are in and have actually started early negotiations with our pilots on number of issues. This is one that fortunately is a win-win as long as we are growing the airline and using regional aircraft in the right kinds of markets to support and feed the mainline with high yield traffic. It is something that also helps our pilots by creating more growth opportunities at the mainline. And I believe we will get something done, but there is no ticking time clock for getting it done. And just sourcing large regional jets out of the what should be mainline markets today, certainly gets us through pretty much as far as we have on our planning horizon. So, it\u2019s really beyond if this opportunity occurs.","David Vernon","All right, I appreciate the color on that. And maybe Andrew, could you help us understand whether there is some additional headwind coming down the pike on the PRASM side if the growth in the back half of the year is about non-peak flying or is this something that you guys are kind of already anticipating and shouldn\u2019t see a major headwind from by adding flights during non-peak hours?","Andrew Nocella","It\u2019s something we look at carefully. I think, the foundation for that needs to be though, we\u2019ve changed the profile on how we fly and we\u2019ve changed the profile of our connectivity. And that connectivity being in the hands of the airline really helped us most in the off-peak quarters than the peak quarters because of the way passengers flow through the system. We have more seats. So, in the off-peak time period, as we build this connectivity, we feel really good. Q1 came in the off-peak flying better than our expectations, and that\u2019s given us a lot of good views as to what the fourth quarter will look like in a similar off-peak situation. So again, the fundamental change is the connectivity new to the airline is allowing us to absorb this capacity in off-peak periods and do very well with it.","David Vernon","So, you\u2019re not seeing the big difference on the fares for the earlier or later departures?","Andrew Nocella","Well, there is a difference in the fares but the marginal CASM and the RASMs are bringing in, we think it is margin accretive, then we\u2019re managing the margin. And we think it\u2019s working out well.","Operator","From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I want to piggyback off of David\u2019s question there. I mean, you guys do have lots of moving pieces in the network right now like rebank in Chicago and adding connectivity in your Hawaiian expansion as well. But then, on the positive side, you have the Gemini and the revenue management systems flowing up. So, I guess I just want to ask, should we think about these expansion projects slowing up over time, driving incremental revenue as time progresses? And with like the revenue management initiative should investors expect that we start to see these accrue to unit revenues a few quarters out or is this more of a margin story?","Andrew Nocella","Definitely managing the margin, but as we move forward, the new routes definitely have lower RASM in their first year than their second year. So, I think there\u2019s a lot of different moving pieces and a lot of initiatives, some of which overlap with each other. But, we\u2019re really hopeful that when we look at how a route will do in year two and how this capacity does in year two, it\u2019ll be better than year one. Also with Gemini, we recently turned the system on. We think we have a long way to go with Gemini in terms of making it better and there are further enhancements coming. So, whether it\u2019s that or many of the other initiatives we have in the pipeline, we think the pipeline\u2019s pretty full with ideas that are going to drive margin and drive RASM in the long run.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. I appreciate that. And on the international side, you did comment that I think you\u2019re rolling out of Polaris equipped aircraft at some frequency now, so that product is actually hitting the market. And I think, you also launched a new economy or premium economy product as well. Can you speak of some of those initiatives and what you think that could actually add longer term?","Andrew Nocella","Sure. As I said, we\u2019re rolling out a Polaris plane every 10 days. We are going to be done by the end of 2020, and we\u2019re really happy with that. Premium Plus is our new mid tier product in between Polaris and economy that is going to also be done on the same schedule as the Polaris aircraft. So, we have a little bit less than three years to go, just given how we do aircraft modifications, that\u2019s what made the most sense. So, we have approximately three years to go on both products. We should start to sell Premium Plus sometime during late this year or early next year for our first flight in the first quarter, but we will have aircraft showing up into the system later this summer with the seat available for purchase with an upgrade. So, we\u2019re very excited about all these initiatives. These are I think really important; it further pushes us down the road as segmentation, particularly with the mid tier cabin, it\u2019s exactly where we want to go. And we\u2019re really confident in its ability to deliver value for the airlines. So, a lot more some on that front but we\u2019re on a way and we\u2019re really proud of the product that we\u2019re going to be putting there over the coming months and years.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Didora","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess, Scott or Andrew, staying on this theme of RASM, margin accretion from this new hub-spoke flying. I guess, when I do look at your domestic schedules, obviously regional ASM\u2019s are up around 10% this year versus down last year, mainline not drastically different. With regional flying garnering nearly double the PRASM of mainline, shouldn\u2019t this have a positive mix effect on your RASM? I\u2019m thinking about this the right way? And if so, can you provide any color on what you think a potential tailwind from more of this line could be?","Andrew Nocella","We have introduced number of 50 seaters and I would like to think we\u2019re at our max in the number of 50 seaters that are flying for United. And those aircraft do come in with higher RASMs and they push higher RASM, higher yield traffic across the entire United system, both domestically and internationally, a lot of the flying is brand new. It is doing as expected. We\u2019re happy with it. We will make tweaks as needed but this is going to be a tailwind to RASM as they go forward and we\u2019re pretty pleased by it. I\u2019m not sure what else to add to that.","Andrew Didora","Okay, thank you for that. And then, my second is maybe digging in a bit more on what you\u2019re seeing on the corporate travel side. I know, your corporate revenues in the quarter were up I think 9% led by energy. But, this is a theme we\u2019ve been hearing positive commentary not out of you guys and some of your peers but from hotel companies as well. Can you give us a sense of maybe where you are in the corporate pricing cycle, where does it stand today versus 2014, and have you seen any change in corporate behavior during any recent contract rate negotiation that you\u2019ve had?","Scott Kirby","I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen any recent changes. Overall, we see a very strong demand environment. And when you look at our international divisions, the premium cabin is leading the way across most of the entities. So, we\u2019re pretty pleased by that. Our sales force has really just hit out park over the last few quarters as we\u2019ve adjusted and made changes to all of our programs to make sure we\u2019re competitive. And we\u2019re really happy with how share is changing and we\u2019re really happy to have a competitive product out there. So, this is going really well. Top line growth of 6%, corporate sale is of 9%, so this is a bigger portion of our aircraft and that\u2019s exactly what we to see. And we don\u2019t see any negative trends at this point in regards to this at all. And Q2 should be another great quarter for corporate business.","Operator","From Raymond James, we have Savanthi Syth. Please go ahead.","Savanthi Syth","If I could just more broadly on the regional perspective, I know you mentioned Pacific obviously inflected in the third -- in March and should be positive here as we go into second quarter. Could you talk about the other entities and maybe kind of sequentially what you might be anticipating there?","Andrew Nocella","Well, I think Atlantic is going to lead the way. Atlantic has seen really good demand in both cabins. So, we\u2019re really pleased by that. So, Atlantic should be our strongest international entity, followed by Pacific. In the quarter, we\u2019ve made the appropriate changes in Guam. So that\u2019s no longer RASM negative for us; in fact, it\u2019s RASM positive going forward. China looks very good. China has been good for the last two quarters. Prior to that, we had a number of negative quarters and China looks good going forward. Latin America is fine, but it\u2019s the weakest of the three international entities. And that really is I think a big part about the holiday shift. The holiday shift for Easter I think has a bigger impact in the United work on the Latin American division than the Pacific division, for example. So, I\u2019d expect while Latin had a great Q1 driven by the holiday shift sequentially, it will be lower in Q2 as we have expected to be because of that. So overall, Atlantic first; Pacific second; Latin third.","Savanthi Syth","And how does domestic fall within that?","Andrew Nocella","Domestic falls just fine. I mean, I\u2019m not going to break out the numbers but it\u2019s -- given where we are and what we are doing and the corporate strength we see, we are really happy with all of our entities as we go forward in the Q2.","Savanthi Syth","And if I may follow-up just a little bit on the connecting traffic question. Could you remind me again, as you execute on that strategy, what the timing is on the build-up and moving things around, and like long that takes? And also, maybe follow-up to that, I know Moody\u2019s was questioning of the competitiveness of Chicago from a airport cost standpoint. How important is airport cost in your calculus of connecting traffic?","Andrew Nocella","Yes. On the hub restructures, we spent a lot of time on this and we did Houston late last year. Unfortunately, we did it exactly when there was a hurricane that came through the region. So, it manipulated the numbers a lot. But, we are really happy with what we see so far in Huston, which is an increase in our mix of higher yielding business, which is what we are hoping for. But, we continue to monitor and we continue to tweaks to the flight schedule as we normally would, and the hub structure schedule as appropriate. Chicago, we just implemented in February. So, we really don\u2019t have any results at this point as to how we are doing there. I mean overall, given our outlook for the next quarter, we think things are positive but we will measure that thoroughly in the coming months and figure out how to make tweaks to make it even better. And it\u2019s not something that you on day one, it is something that evolves over time as we learn what works and what needs to be changed optimize it better. But so far so good, and we have Denver planned for either late this year early next year depending on a number circumstances to make that structure even better. So, great so far, good so far, but we still need to measure this a lot more and make tweaks as appropriate.","Savanthi Syth","And I\u2019m guessing the airport costs are not a big driver as the profitability when you think about the connecting traffic?","Andrew Nocella","Well, I mean, airport costs are something we monitor closely and it has been a recent headwind. So, it\u2019s something we negotiate with airports and we want to make sure that all of our hubs have competitive costs and the features, so we are able to do what we need to do from a network perspective. And we have that all baked in our plan. We know what it is, we know what it isn\u2019t and we are moving forward.","Operator","From JP Morgan we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","I have got four questions with five follow-ups. First one for Scott or Andrew Nocella. Has the better corporate environment domestically led you to decrease the inventory allocated to Basic Economy or is your competitive positioning in ultra-low cost carrier over that market is sort of business as usual, any changes there?","Andrew Nocella","There is no -- well, I\u2019ll take one step back and say, our inventory for Basic Economy is not a strategic decision, I think it\u2019s made -- here is how much we\u2019re going to put out. It really is driven by the yield management system and the yield management system is trying to maximize the expected value of each seat. And so, to the extent demand is stronger, the yield management system will make your Basic Economy fares available because they are lowest fares. And when demand is weaker, it will have more. So, yes, it\u2019s a strong demand environment. So, that probably means there are fewer Basic Economy seats available but it\u2019s -- there is nothing strategic about it or -- and it is really very much at the margins.","Jamie Baker","And second and final question actually for Greg Hart, obviously in the early innings right now but if the FAA does order widespread inspection in CFM56-7Bs, how should we think about that in terms of time and expense for United? Is that a fairly simple exercise or does it require aircraft to be pulled from service? ","Greg Hart","Hey, Jamie. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we don\u2019t want to get ahead of NTSB on this and their investigation. But, there was an event time on another airline back in August of 2016, which actually drove a service bulletin that was issued last week. And we have started work on that service bulletin and are well underway with that process and expect to complete it as quickly as possible. Obviously safety is paramount in everything we do here at airlines and this event or this issue is not different and we\u2019re fully focused on making sure that we complete as quickly as we can.","Oscar Munoz","On the cost question, I think this service bulletin was on board. We are going to do it and that\u2019s embedded in our cost forecast for the future, so, no incremental cost. But again, safety is paramount important.","Operator","From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Just following up on domestic as we measure the recovery in domestic PRASM, and appreciate seasonal moves from month-to-month, but there was a time when we\u2019d sort of enter a month behind on advance book yields and kind of make it up close in. Can you just talk to advance book yields now for kind of April, May, June?","Scott Kirby","Advance book yield, the short answer is advance book yields are good. It\u2019s a strong demand environment. So, that means, not only can you have good close-in demand and reserved seats for close-in demand, you -- the same happens when you are further out, you can be -- have opportunities to be more aggressive there as well. So, we feel good, really good about the demand environment across all entities. We\u2019re trying to contain our enthusiasm, but we feel really good about that demand environment.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. And then, just on Basic Economy and the implementation last year, you launched it fairly aggressively across the fare ladder. And if memory serves, you actually lost some share because of that in the early innings. As we think about a 2Q and in the comp, can you just remind us how much that was worth? Is that maybe worth a point in the comp?","Scott Kirby","It\u2019s really more of a third quarter than a second quarter issue. And I\u2019m not sure what the number was, we never said a number. Obviously our third quarter comps get -- we kind of had the perfect storm of stuff happening, last year storms, Guam in the third quarter. So, our comps hopefully should be easier in the third quarter, in particular. There really was not much of an impact in the second quarter -- I don\u2019t think into May.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Hey, just two quick ones here. This is probably Andrew or Scott. We\u2019ve heard a lot about increased competition on the West Coast. you guys are big in LA, you guys are big in San Fran, what are you guys seeing in that marketplace?","Andrew Nocella","Sure, it\u2019s Andrew. Overall, I think particularly from a San Francisco centric point of view, things are looking good. In fact, we had positive PRASM in our San Francisco hub in the quarter, and we\u2019re really pleased to see that given it\u2019s a pretty competitive environment. But, we\u2019re really confident what we\u2019re doing in San Francisco. We have a great product, great schedule and all the above and the new Polaris lounge about to open in a few weeks as well. So, we feel really good about San Francisco and what\u2019s going on in the West Coast at this point.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Then, just second question, this is probably for you Andrew Nocella as well. When we look at passengers flying on domestic segments who are connecting to international, what percentage or what amount of load factor points, however you can express that, what would be that domestic leg, where the O&D involves in international destination or origination?","Andrew Nocella","I don\u2019t think we have the exact number. We\u2019ll get it to you. But for United Airlines, it is a pretty significant number going across the whole system. So, it is -- it does impact results. When international results get better, our domestic, we call it DPIJ, our domestic portion of the international journey also gets better, and I\u2019ll have Mike get you the exact load factor number after the call.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hey, good morning. Hey, Scott, do you know what percentage of your business travelers never fly internationally? Is that something you track and do you have a target around where you want that to be?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t know which also means we don\u2019t have a target.","Hunter Keay","Okay. And then, back to scope real quick. Are you comfortable taking advantage of the 1.25 to 1 ratio language in the existing CBA without a new CBA or would you consider sort of an amended CBA as a gating item to take advantage of that ratio clause even in the event that that clause doesn\u2019t change in the new contract, if you\u2019re understanding the question?","Scott Kirby","Yes. Look, I\u2019m not even going to get ahead of the discussions we\u2019re having with all the stakeholders, pilots and aircraft manufacturers at the same time. Obviously that\u2019s a backstop but we\u2019re talking to them and would like to get to a road where we have something that everyone is on board with, agrees with and agrees that it\u2019s good for United Airlines and our entire workforce as well.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Scott, a question for you. As far as rolling out the retail strategy, what surprises have you come across so far? And specifically I\u2019m referring to are planes filling up quicker than you\u2019re expecting, are you not getting a competitor spot? Just some color so we could keep track of how things are going.","Scott Kirby","I think, it\u2019s going largely as we anticipated. There are some operational bumps along the road, but we anticipated those, you never know which ones are going to occur exactly but we anticipated that there\u2019d be some operational issues. But, I think, actually team has done a remarkable job for the amount of change that we have had to implement as well as they have. Look, I mean the fact that United has been number one in D0 for seven months in a row with all the growth and all the change and all the regional changes is a testaments to Greg Hart and his entire leadership team because it\u2019s hard enough to do that, to produce great results, particularly when we\u2019re in the most challenged geographies, but to do it at the same time that we got -- managing a lot of change is really incredible. But, it is performing largely as we expected.","Rajeev Lalwani","And then, a quick question for Andrew Nocella. You talked about traction on the corporate side, you threw out some impressive numbers. Can you just talk more about what\u2019s driving that, like what is the proposition that you are giving at corporate that\u2019s making them come to United, is it price, is it something else?","Andrew Nocella","Sure. I really think it is a sales force that has just gotten so excited about the United and what we\u2019re doing. And we talked about all the tools that they need to be competitive in the marketplace, and we\u2019ve armed them, and they are out there promoting the United in a way that I think has really helped us and has shifted some demand to us. Although we still have a strong underlying marketplace out there for premium demand as well. So, it\u2019s all kind of working together. But, I really will give credit to our sales force for making a huge difference in the quarter and we\u2019re really proud of them. And we think Q2 to see even more of that.","Operator","From Citi, we Kevin Crissey. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey","Thanks for the time. So, looking at the domestic RASM and I think that others have alluded to it, the pure -- what I call, pure domestic origin to a domestic destination, given the strength of international RASM would be lower than the 1.6% that you posted. So, when I think about your future growth and beyond what is scheduled, when I think about 2019 and 2020 growth, how much of those flights are going to be designed for international connecting itineraries versus primarily for domestic origins and domestic destinations. So, I think about flights to Orlando as being primarily domestic focused as opposed to maybe some of the small connections.","Andrew Nocella","I\u2019m not sure I think of it that way. Our network all works together. All of our hubs are significant international getaways and even Denver has a growing international presence. We just started Denver to London Heathrow. So, as that all works together, I don\u2019t think I would separate it that way. And we\u2019re bullish across all the different segments we have and the new connectivity we\u2019re generating, particularly as we said in January, the connectivity we\u2019re creating in the small to small or small to medium type of cities that have I think really n ice yield environment. So overall, we feel really good about it and we don\u2019t have the distinction.","Operator","From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Scott, does the importance of regional feed to your growth strategy over the next few years changed the way you think about the need to have a wholly-owned regional sub?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re diagnostic about how we see the airline. And we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on these calls, we\u2019ve sort of spent a lot of time talking about regional feed. It\u2019s not just regional feed, regional feed is you just want to understand the higher yield but a lot of that is also mainline. And as you grow regional feed you also wind up-gauging regional markets to mainline. But, we are agnostic as to whether or not the best way to do that is through a wholly owned or through a third-party, whatever is most efficient, the best operator at cost is who we will use.","Joseph DeNardi","And then, Scott or maybe Andrew, you guys are both pretty bullish on demand. Just trying to reconcile, I guess your exuberance with the second quarter guide. I know, there is a lot of capacity growth. But, maybe can you help us like with the same store PRASM number, just any way to reconcile your bullishness around demand with the unit revenue.","Andrew Nocella","Well, I think we have always said, there is a shift in the holiday. So, we knew March would be strong and sequentially that April would be more difficult, and that in fact has happened. So I don\u2019t have a same store type of analysis for you. But the holiday shift is causing a sequential decline, particularly in Latin America is a great example of that. But it\u2019s not unexpected. I\u2019ll say that even with that decline if we look across the Atlantic, I think our outlook across the Atlantic doesn\u2019t show that. So right now, we are really -- I think we\u2019ve said we are bullish across the Atlantic and we are because of the numbers we are seeing over the next 30 or 45 days, particularly in the business class cabin. Right now, obviously we\u2019re lapping Easter last year and we are seeing good results across the Atlantic as we do that.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From Reuters, we have Alana Wise. Please go ahead.","Alana Wise","So, given the tragedy that happened yesterday on the Southwest flight, I\u2019m wondering if United is planning to look into or speed up any inspections of engines in its 737 model jets and any others with the CFM engines.","Oscar Munoz","Alana, hi. This is Oscar. As Greg mentioned earlier, a service bulletin was issued just last week regarding an event that had happened previously on another airline. And so, as a result, we did kick off the program to address the bulletin and we\u2019ll be fully compliant. And again, that started just recently. So, yes, we will follow the same program.","Alana Wise","And do you have any idea of the time table of completion and how many engines or how many of these engines are actually in United fleet?","Oscar Munoz","Not really. This will be ongoing through the course of the year.","Greg Hart","This is Greg Hart. We have about 698 of these engines in our fleet.","Operator","And from Flightglobal, we have Edward Russell. Please go ahead.","Edward Russell","Could you comment on the fleet plan going out through 2020? I mean how many -- do you have any mainline aircraft coming off lease in that period and do you plan to extend the leases or buy them off -- can you give a little idea on what the mainline fleet is going to look like over this period?","Andrew Nocella","This is Andrew. I don\u2019t have the numbers at my fingertips as to how many aircraft coming off operating lease in the next few years. But the number of aircraft on operating lease continues to shrink as we bring more aircraft out of the balance sheet. The reason we do that is we are agnostic about financing but often times it is just simply better cash economics to have -- to purchase those airplanes rather than continue to lease them. And so that\u2019s we are doing a lot of that. As far as on a go forward basis, we look at each individual deal on a case-by-case basis. And I suspect that there are many that we will look to acquire or extend. And there are others that we will simply give back to the less. So, we\u2019ve provided some information on the 2018 fleet plan in the investor update. And we\u2019re not really compared to go into a whole lot more detail other than the specific callouts we have today on a few expected deliveries and we expect to see including the airbus used A319 transaction that we discussed earlier.","Edward Russell","Okay. Is it right to generally assume that the mainline fleet will grow -- likely grow in 2019 and 2020, without going to specifics?","Andrew Nocella","Yes. I think clearly, yes, we definitely have that expectation that we will see growth in order to execute on the long-term growth plan that we\u2019ve provided information on through 2020. Certainly part of that is dependent on adding additional aircraft into the mainline. So, we absolutely will be growing mainline.","Operator","From Wall Street Journal we have Dough Cameron. Please go ahead.","Doug Cameron","Oscar and Scott have talked about this before, just kind of deepening the alliance front and putting yourself in a place with some of your rivals who perhaps had alliances a bit longer have done. I just wonder, if you could comment a little bit on what that actually practically entails. And I guess, just as a side line, was there a bit of a credibility gap because of its operational problems which kind of made some deeper alliances more problematic? That\u2019s maybe putting the cart before the horse but any comments on what you can practically do to deepen the alliances would be useful.","Scott Kirby","So, first actually Star Alliance and United as founding member is the oldest of the alliances. That\u2019s a\u2026","Doug Cameron","You shouldn\u2019t be behind then.","Scott Kirby","That said, we had opportunities to work more closely together than we had historically. We got some nominal alliance partners. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time working with them. Andrew Nocella and myself personally meet with them frequently. And having that kind of high level of engagement has already led the changes. They are not going to be some big bang and press release talking about, but we everyday get better. If you look across the Atlantic, our impressive results are partially because our partnerships with Air Canada and Lufthansa, and how we are working more closely together as a team. And we think that there is continuing opportunities to improve that going forward. But, we are very pleased with our partners and how\u2026","Doug Cameron","But to be honest, I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s all a very vague. I\u2019d just [Indiscernible] because you have brought this up before, the need to deepen the alliances and obviously Delta and American will show it from rooftops about the money they are making from their partnership. So, really interested in digging a little bit better than that you have great partners.","Scott Kirby","Yes. Unfortunately, that\u2019s all confidential and it\u2019s stuff that we keep behind the curtains on what exactly we\u2019re doing tactically with our partners.","Operator","From Bloomberg News, we have Michael Sasso, please go ahead.","Michael Sasso","Yes. Can you give maybe a little more information on these 20 used A319s? We\u2019ve been hearing that easyJet may be the source of those. Can you talk about where these are coming from and in fact are they coming from easyJet?","Scott Kirby","Hey, Mike. So, they\u2019re midlife aircraft that we\u2019re acquiring. As far as where they\u2019re coming from, we\u2019re not able to disclose that information due to provisions in the purchase agreement. So, as much as I\u2019d love to tell you that I\u2019m just unable to do so.","Andrew Levy","Mike, the seller asked us not to disclose yet.","Operator","Thank you. We will now turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.","Mike Leskinen","Thanks to all for joining the call today. Please contact media relations, if you have any further questions. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining.

Please go ahead, sir.","Jonathan Ireland","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release and separate investor update. Additionally, this morning, we issued a presentation to accompany this call. All three of these documents are available on our website at ir.united.com. Information on yesterday\u2019s release and investor update and remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the Company\u2019s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance.","All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the Company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to our press release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Continental Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors. Also, during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures.

We also have Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, Greg Hart in the room to assist with Q&A. ","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everybody. This quarter marked another period in which United took meaningful steps forward in transforming the direction of this Company. Notably, we saw our 25,000 flight attendants ratify new contract, our over 9,000 technicians reached a tentative agreement for a joint contract, and we\u2019re excited to have that ratified soon. Additionally, in the quarter, as most of you know, I solidified my leadership team. This team has deep industry experience, incredible talent in my opinion and a very focused dedication to bring United into its next chapter, realizing a full potential of our great people and the great network and our assets.","On the business side, we also continued to run a solid operation in the quarter. In fact, we achieved the best third quarter on-time performance in our history. I am going to take this opportunity to thank dedicated and professional United employees that make all of this happen. Thanks to your commitment and determined efforts, we delivered a Company best performance for arrivals during the busy July 4th holiday travel period. We also earned a first or second place ranking in key arrivals and departure measures in the three months between Memorial Day and September 1st, and culminated our great summer month performance with delivering the best Labor Day weekend performance numbers on record. So, it\u2019s great to have our operating program and people back in a good consistent application of their work.","On the financial side, we continued to record strong financial results including a pre-tax profit of $1.6 billion and a pre-tax margin of 15.7%, both excluding special items. As many of know, we will host an Investor Day on November 15th. With that in mind, today, we will focus our discussion on our recent performance and near-term outlook and wait until November for a discussion of our plans for beyond 2017, including our outlook for both CASM and capacity.","So, with that said, I\u2019d like to turn the call over -- this is the maiden voyage of both Mr. Kirby, Ms. Haywood, and Mr. Levy. But before I do that, let me say to them all that we\u2019re incredibly thrilled to have each of you join the United family and very much looking forward to sharing our future with you. With that, Scott?","Scott Kirby","Thank you, Oscar. Before turning to the slides, I just want to start by saying that I\u2019m very excited to have joined the United team and there are just fantastic opportunities ahead of us. This really is an exciting time for United. It\u2019s true that the last several years have been challenging with the integration that took longer. It was more complex than anticipated, which created cultural, operating and commercial challenges. But now with the integration largely in the past, we can all turn our focus to realizing the full potential of United for our employees, customers and investors.","The foundation of a great airline is its people. And in the Oscar\u2019s leadership, United has made tremendous progress on creating an integrated, united United. Achieving our full potential will require lots of hard work. But with great people, the best network potential, the right plan and the focus on solid execution, we can deliver a great network, operations, and customer service, which in turn will lead the financial results that reflect the full potential of this airline. Julia will touch on some of the high level opportunities in a moment but before she does, I\u2019d like to take the time and run through the quarter\u2019s performance.","On slide six, you can see that we made meaningful strides in improving the operation over the past couple of years. On time departures, arrivals, completion factor and mishandled baggage performance have all seen meaningful improvement. Going forward, we expect we\u2019ll continue to improve our operational results through better processes, smart investments and a commitment to efficiency. As we\u2019ve talked about here in the past at United, running a reliable airline is a key to winning other customers and regaining customers that we\u2019ve lost during some of the operational challenges that we had with integration from 2012 through 2014.","Turning to revenue, slide seven shows consolidated unit revenue performance for the past quarter, which declined 5.8%. This is slightly better than initial expectations due in part to better close-in, bookings and yields into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast consolidated PRASM will decline between 4% and 6%. As you can see on slide, we continue to see sequential second derivative unit revenue improvement as we\u2019re lapping many of the headwinds we have experienced over the past few quarters. For now at least, it appears that we are mostly -- most of the big one-time issues that have been affecting PRASM are in the task. One of the stories in this slide is that issues like currency, energy et cetera aren\u2019t really having a meaningful impact year-over-year any longer.","We continue to see the sequential improvement in unit revenues despite the fact that there is a meaningful calendar shift of revenues out of fourth quarter and into the third and first quarters. Getting back to positive PRASM is now about a balanced supply demand environment, advancements in product segmentation as well as many United specific opportunities that we\u2019ll talk in more detail about at Investor Day in few weeks.","Slide eight has some additional detail in each of the geographic regions. Domestically, we\u2019re seeing positive close-in corporate booking trends and a better alignment of supply and demand. Additionally, the domestic pricing environment is beginning to feel more rational. We expect the Atlantic to remain the weakest region of the world. Overall capacity continues to grow at high rates. At the same, the demand is growing more slowly putting pressure on unit revenues. In the Pacific, we expect to see a continuation of recent trends with modest unit revenue declines, modest at least as compared to the Atlantic. And we expect Latin America to be the first region to return to positive year-over-year PRASM, driven by good results across the region but particularly strong results in Brazil.","In summary, we think the revenue environment has bottomed and we\u2019re starting to see signs of recovery in all regions with the possible exception of the Atlantic.","At this time, I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Julia to share with you her high level thoughts on commercial opportunities that we\u2019ve identified at United, each of which we\u2019ll discuss in a greater detail next month\u2019s Investor Day.","Julia Haywood","Great, thanks Scott. I\u2019m also very proud to join the United team. Ever since I began working with United, I can see the potential of our Company and I\u2019m excited to be part of the team to unlock that potential. We see a number of opportunities throughout our commercial landscape to improve earnings over the next several years with the largest opportunities being in revenue management, network optimization, product segmentation, and product improvement. I will provide some high level thoughts on each today and we look forward to our upcoming Investor Day where we will provide more details on these opportunities including actions that we are taking and the associated financial impacts.","So, first, with respect to revenue management, we believe there are a variety of both near term and longer term opportunities to improve share of United. Solutions for these opportunities can range from small but meaningful tweaks to our revenue management system to making more wholesale changes to our strategies for managing both pricing and inventory. And while much of this work has been delayed during United\u2019s integration, we are now moving quickly ahead.","Second with respect to our network. Let me start by echoing Scott\u2019s earlier comment. United has the best network potential of any U.S. carrier, but we are not utilizing it fully today. We have spent the summer working to refine the mission of each of our hubs, and we look forward to sharing some of our thoughts with you at Investor Day. But as an important note, the full details of our network playbook won\u2019t be fully revealed in order to protect competitively sensitive information.","The third area of opportunity we will discuss is product segmentation. As you know, the work being done in this area signals a meaningful step change for our customers, and I believe that over time, it will have an even larger financial impact than the introduction of bag fees. We will use the time at our Investor Day to describe in more detail our entry level fare product while also providing further plans to advance the segmentation progress in other areas here at United.","Finally, we will discuss the changes we are making with respect to our product and travel experience for our customers. In particular, we are now investing in the premium experience, rolling out United Polaris, our all-new business class service, transforming United clubs and elevating our food and beverage offering.","In summary, we are looking forward to this day and sharing with you the hard work we have been doing to establish a commercial plan to the organization. Like Scott, I am thrilled to be part of this team and could not be more excited about the opportunities I see ahead for United.","So, as a wrap up, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank our customers. In my past life, I spent more hours than I\u2019d like to recount on planes and in airports, and I understand how important it is that we deliver to you the travel experience that you expect. The team here has made great strides over the past year and I know that there are even more opportunities to come.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Levy","Thanks Julia. I too am excited to be part of the United team. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be successful in making United the best airline in the world. Yesterday afternoon, we released our third quarter earnings and fourth quarter investor update. While I will discuss both our results and outlook today at a high level, please refer to both of these documents for additional details. With that said, let\u2019s review the Company\u2019s third quarter financial performance and fourth quarter outlook.","Slide 12 shows a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 13 has our non-GAAP results. Company generated pre-tax income excluding special items of $1.6 billion with a pre-tax margin of 15.7%. Net income was $1 billion, a decline from $1.7 billion in third quarter of 2015 due almost entirely to our higher booked tax rate in 2016. Adjusting for booked taxes, net income was down 9% but earnings per share increased 7% due to the 15% reduction in share count as compared with 3Q 2015.","Moving to slide 14, non-fuel unit costs in the third quarter increased 3.4% excluding special items, profit sharing and third-party business expenses. Approximately 2 percentage points of this increase was due to the impact of labor agreements ratified in 2016 with our pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers and IAM represented employees. We expect fourth quarter non-fuel unit costs excluding special items, profit sharing and third-party business expense to increase between 4.75% and 5.75%. Approximately 4 percentage points of this increase is due to the impact of these new labor agreements. Our projections however do not include the effects of a recently ratified tenant agreement with our maintenance technicians since it has not yet been ratified.","As you can see on slide 15, we expect full year 2016 non-fuel CASM to increase between 2.75% and 3.25% with 2.3 percentage points of this increase due to the new labor agreements. However, in 2017, year-over-year effect of these agreements is only expected to be between 1.5 and 2 percentage points. As provided in yesterday\u2019s investor update, we currently expect our fourth quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items to be between 5% and 7%.","Turning to slide 16 and capital allocation, let me start by saying that we believe a healthy balance sheet and adequate liquidity is critical. We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our $1.35 billion revolver which remains untapped. Adjusted CapEx including aircraft, non-aircraft, and aircraft purchase deposits was roughly $680 million in third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to take delivery of eight new mainline aircraft which contributes to CapEx of between $935 million and $955 million. We have already secured financing for these deliveries through last month\u2019s EETC transaction. For the full year, we expect approximately $3.2 billion in capital expenditures.","We also contributed $240 million for our pension plans this quarter, bringing our year-to-date contributions to $400 million. We do not plan any additional contributions this year. With respect to the share repurchase, we returned $255 million to shareholders purchasing 5.2 million shares during the quarter that brings the total amount of cash returned to shareholders to $2.4 billion year-to-date. And since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2014, we spent $4 billion to repurchase roughly 20% of shares outstanding. We currently have $2 billion remaining under our repurchase authority.","On our upcoming Investor Day, we will talk in detail about our plans for the capital structure of the business including our views on liquidity, CapEx, debt, pension funding and shareholder returns. We will continue to be focused on finding ways to invest efficiently in our business. This quarter, we had added our second used A319 to our fleet and plan to take a total of 11 of these aircraft by the end of 2017. In addition, we are reviewing our long-term CapEx needs including the fleet and we will give you a more in-depth update next month. Returning excess cash to shareholders will continue to be an important part of the United capital allocation strategy and we plan to providing the context for our plans going forward.","In closing, this was a very good quarter for United and I am excited on many good quarters to come. I look forward to speaking to each of you again in the next few weeks as we lay out our strategic plan for the Company.","I\u2019ll turn it back to Oscar now.","Oscar Munoz","Great, thanks Andrew. As you heard from the team, there is a lot of energy about the future, and we do have a great day planned for you on November 15th. In addition to what Scott and Julia, Andrew have suggested with regards to the outline of that agenda, we are also going to have Linda Jojo and Greg Hart discuss improvements in both our IT systems and operations broadly so that you can better understand I think the great work being done in those areas to make United more efficient and nimble.","I also understand the importance of the establishing goals by which you as shareowners can hold us accountable in order to ensure the execution of our plans. We will use the Investor Day to provide financial metrics and targets by which we are managing our business so that you can also track our progress as we execute upon these plans.","Let me close again by thanking our customers for flying United. We\u2019re focused everyday on continuing to find opportunities to improve your travel experience and I want to thank you for your business and look forward to seeing you on a flight soon.","With that let me turn over the conference to Jonathan.","Jonathan Ireland","Thanks you, Oscar. We will now take questions from the analyst community. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Jonathan. [Operator Instructions] And from Deutsche Bank, we have Michael Linenberg please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","I guess if I could do two quick ones here, just Andrew, you mentioned 2017 CASM ex-fuel up 1.5 to 2 as a result of the recent labor deals, presumably that doesn\u2019t include any sort of a match on your pilot deal since the Delta deal is still out there, it\u2019s tentative. But does that include the technician piece, the mechanic deal assuming that goes through or would that be in addition to that?","Andrew Levy","Couple of things, just to clarify, I want to make sure that my comments were communicated as I intended them to be, which is that we expect the effect of the existing labor agreements, the new ones that does not include the technicians, it does not include any snap up on the pilots, we expect the effect of that next year to be between 1.5% and 2%. So, that is not a CASM forecast, that is just the increase associated with the existing agreements. So, I think -- hope that answered all of your questions with that.","Michael Linenberg","Yes. That\u2019s a perfect clarification. And then just to Julia, you alluded to the rollout of call it your entry level fares or at least alluded to talking about it at the Investor Day. I think the plan was for it to be rolled out sometime this month. Why the delay and when do we think that that will actually come into effect?","Julia Haywood","We\u2019re looking forward to bringing it in later this year. We\u2019re going to talk more about that at Investor Day. With Scott and I coming in, we wanted to take another look at everything that we\u2019re offering within that product segment and make sure that is exactly the way we wanted to be and that we also roll it out really well to the front line. So, we\u2019re just taking an extra beat on that and we\u2019ll talk more about it at Investor Day.","Operator","From Credit Suisse, we have Julie Yates on line. Please go ahead.","Julie Yates","A question on domestic RASM, so your peer noted that on a combined basis, domestic RASM for the November to January time period should be flattish trying to normalize for some of that holiday shift. Do you agree with this assessment? And if not, what are you seeing that would suggest otherwise?","Scott Kirby","I\u2019m not sure I would get all the way to flattish. We do see continuous improvement in the domestic environment. I think it\u2019s also right to kind of look at it November through January to count for all the calendar shifts. I\u2019m not sure we get to flattish, but it\u2019s certainly trending that direction. I think we started actually, because where we were in the third quarter compared to our competitor, we start from a better position. So, I suspect we will get to positive domestic PRASM before they do. I think we also have more opportunity and more levers that are probably United specific. But we are certainly trending in that direction. And whether it\u2019s going to get there in November to January or shortly thereafter, it\u2019s hard to say certain at this point. But we\u2019re trending in that direction and we feel pretty good about the domestic environment, certainly feels better than it has been a couple of years. Now acknowledge that\u2019s an easy comparison, because hasn\u2019t felt very good past couple of years but it feels better than it has in quite some time.","Julie Yates","And then Andrew just one quick one for you. Is there any color -- and I understand you haven\u2019t given ASM and you might want to reserve this for Investor Day, but is there any color you can offer on how we should think about the core CASM ex-growth for 2017?","Andrew Levy","We\u2019ll get into that in a little more detail in a month Julie. But we expect at this point in time that it\u2019s going to be consistent with the performance that United has delivered in the past few years. I think United has done a very good job controlling that, its cost structure, the core CASM and I would expect that to be similar as we look forward. But we\u2019ll give you more specific number at Investor Day in about a month from now.","Julie Yates","Okay.","Oscar Munoz","Julie, this is Oscar. I just want to jump in to Andrew\u2019s comment. Core CASM is an area that will continue. Despite the history, we\u2019ll continue to focus in that strong. We have several initiatives that we\u2019re thinking through, but we\u2019ve got a lot of moving parts and we\u2019ll provide a little bit more color again at this infamous now Investor Day. So, thanks Julie.","Julie Yates","Okay, great. And Andrew, one last one, are there any offsets from the recent contracts that have been ratified in terms of profit sharing changes or greater productivity?","Andrew Levy","There are some offsets, certainly on the profit sharing. And I think that each agreement kind of stands on its own. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to go in individual detail with each one. But as one example with the flight attendant deal today, it\u2019s 15% profit sharing and it\u2019s going to drop down to -- I think it\u2019s a tiered approach, which would be from 10 to 20 depending on the level of profitability. That\u2019s one example. But we have to kind of look at each one on its own merits to go through the puts and takes. But look, I mean for the most part, we\u2019re going to see an increase in labor expense. It is not completely offset by the profit sharing or productivity. So, we\u2019re going to have to find ways to drive revenue and reduce expense to continue to grow margins.","Operator","From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","Hey, Scott, you called out some one-time PRASM drivers in your prepared remarks but one thing that I didn\u2019t see in there was the impact of the service disruptions away from you during Q3. Could you all characterize that or was it just not meaningful enough to include in there?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t think it was meaningful at all. If you go look at our data on a day-to-day basis, you certainly can\u2019t find where it happened. So, I don\u2019t think it was meaningful.","Darryl Genovesi","And then with regard to China, you guys called out some -- I guess the outlook for the capacity situation to improve as we approach the caps on a bilateral. Can you just help us understand how you are thinking about the timing of the potential RASM improvement across the Pacific? It looks like -- the fourth quarter doesn\u2019t look great but as you look out into early next year, how do you think the change in the bilateral sort of impact the capacity growth rate over time? And then I guess looking a little further out with the new airport being constructed in Beijing, if there is a strong possibility that that bilateral gets amended to include more capacity on both sides? Thank you.","Scott Kirby","So, if you look at our third quarter and fourth quarter PRASM forecast for the Pacific, all things considered, I think that\u2019s actually quite strong performance, particularly for us where in the fourth quarter we\u2019re starting the second San Francisco to Shanghai. So, we\u2019ll have for United at least fair amount of capacity growth. So, for that environment, I think we\u2019re actually doing pretty well. There is a lot of capacity growth out of China in particular but as you point out, the bilaterals were almost capped. And so that\u2019s going to slow down dramatically in 2017 and beyond. The opposite is happening in Japan where capacity is starting to be reduced and we see strong performance in Japan. And so, across the board, we feel pretty good about the trans-Pacific environment.","Looking further out, once the new airport opens, it takes a long time to chase bilaterals and there is more than just chasing route authorities. The complication with flying to China is you have the route authorities being able to get slots at commercially viable times; it\u2019s been really difficult. And so, I expect that would be part of the next set of negotiations. And so that\u2019s difficult; again, it\u2019s difficult. I suspect it will take quite a bit of time to get results.","Operator","From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Just two questions; one, can you say if there was any improvement, if any of your domestic markets showed a positive RASM during the third quarter? I think Delta commented that they saw about 33% in their markets. And I\u2019m just wondering what that number was for you.","Scott Kirby","Yes. It\u2019s actually 43% of our markets have positive year-over-year PRASM domestically. Look, that\u2019s an interesting statistic; I only know it because someone asked on the Delta call or they said it and so checked. But what\u2019s I think more important is the momentum that that has for the domestic environment and there is -- this can turn out to be wrong but there is lots of little things that are going on with pricing and with a lot of carriers going through and cleaning up pricing in the domestic environment and make us feel pretty constructive about that entity in particular.","Helane Becker","So, I can take away from that that you think it\u2019s relatively sustainable, even with calendar shifts aside?","Scott Kirby","Yes. I mean, you have to adjust for the calendar shifts. But adjusting for that, I think that the momentum and -- the domestic -- overall system and the domestic is going to continue to improve on year-over-year basis and the results are going to get better.","Helane Becker","Great. And then just a question for you, Oscar. In June, there was an investor call and there were a whole bunch of revenue and cost initiatives that were presented to us. Should we ignore those or maybe not ignore is the right word but maybe set aside those in favor of upcoming initiatives that will be discussed in Investor Day or how should we think about that June call?","Oscar Munoz","So, my view and I\u2019ll have Julia and Scott share theirs as well since they are deeply involved in the past work. I think it\u2019s safe to say that the existing work will be not only continued but built upon and gain some incremental value. But I\u2019ll let the folks in the middle of it talk. Julia?","Julia Haywood","I think as we look, we are going to talk a little bit more on Investor Day but I think we see upside from what we\u2019ve seen from the numbers that we\u2019re reconciling against versus some of the new ideas and initiatives that we started talking about. There may be some re-bucketing that exists, Helane but besides that I think we see only that will subside. [Ph] So, it\u2019s great news.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on line. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Scott, one of the things I think you did at American well was you reduced forecast error in the revenue management tool, so -- over the last year or two particularly. So, how is forecast error within UAL\u2019s RM tool suite; where do you want to get it; and do you think you have the IT in place to improve it?","Scott Kirby","I think that there is a lot of opportunity there. We\u2019re going to actually spend a fair bit of time at investor day talking about this. So, I\u2019ll give you a little bit of preview. I like using one example from the summer. In July as United was seeing stronger demand and bookings were coming in strong at the domestic entity, tried to boost the demand and increase the amount of demand. And so, we took a set of markets and didn\u2019t do anything, and we took another set of markets and increased the local demand by a 100% in the forecast, another set of market and increased both the local and the flow demand by 20%. Those were massive, massive changes in demand, and you would expect that to lead to massive changes in output. And at the end of the experiment, those three sets of entities, those three different experimental groups were 0.2% different in outcomes. What that tells you is -- and what that really is, we have a big complicated system. We don\u2019t even have a process to measure forecast versus actuals because it\u2019s so big and complicated. And the team does a fantastic job of managing on the backend but we\u2019re hand managing a lot of markets on the backend and as great as people are, you can\u2019t do that as well as a robust system with thousands and millions of data points can do. Even things like this year coming into Christmas, the demand patterns dramatically differ with Christmas on a Sunday instead of Christmas on a Friday and we don\u2019t have any history that goes back to a time when Christmas was last on a Sunday. So we\u2019re trying to hand this.","All of that -- the team has done a great job managing that in that environment but it is a significant opportunity. It\u2019s going to require a lot of work; it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. It is going to require some changes in the system. Our fundamental architecture of the system that we\u2019re built on can handle it; there are no issues there. We\u2019re just going to have to build, do the work to build on top of that and do a management. But it\u2019ll take time and we\u2019ll talk more about this at Investor Day, but I think it is a significant opportunity that\u2019s unique to United Airlines.","Oscar Munoz","And I\u2019ll also add; I can just add real quickly, over the years people have characterized the United network in very broad and positive terms but yet we\u2019ve never been able to realize the full potential of that. I think you just heard another example of what are the things that have been sort of missing, really take it to [indiscernible]. Again level of energy and excitement in our company is based upon -- predicated on the fact that we have some very-very good people on this now and you can see great output over time as Scott says.","Hunter Keay","Yes, that\u2019s -- I will look forward to hearing more about this at the Analyst Day. And that\u2019s actually a good segue into my next question. When -- you guys actually -- you split the VP of network role into two roles recently; you are going to have one person overseeing the domestic network and one person overseeing the international network. So, to me that says that you feel like one of those two is particularly underperforming. So, is that a fair characterization and if so, which do you think is underperforming more relative to where it should be, domestic or international?","Julia Haywood","I think we have a very strong international network, I think we have for many years. There\u2019s more that we can be doing on that side for sure. On the domestic side, outside coming in, I think we thought there was a lot of opportunity there and I think that\u2019s only been confirmed from the inside now. So Scott and I are working together with the team to understand the full potential of the domestic network and I think we see significant upside there.","Scott Kirby","You\u2019re reading a little much into it about the org structure as people are -- anything like that but we do, we have the best international network certainly of any U.S. carrier that goes -- that\u2019s no one argues that. But we do not have the same kind of margins domestically or have the same kind of success domestically as American and Delta do. And we can get there. It\u2019s another area that I think we have more upside than the others because there\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff; it\u2019s in your management, it can be sales, it\u2019s in the latest schedule, so all kinds of stuff at the Company that\u2019s been very focused on international. But without losing any of that I think we can improve the results in the domestic network.","Operator","From Buckingham Research we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","I know you\u2019re saving a lot for the Investor Day, but I\u2019m wondering if you can share just more broadly the growth plans for 2017 and how that would break out domestically versus internationally.","Scott Kirby","Dan, we\u2019d love to share but we don\u2019t actually, just don\u2019t have it done yet. As Julia alluded to earlier, we got new people here taking a new look at some of the things. And we will be ready to give you more detail at Investor Day but I apologize, we just don\u2019t -- aren\u2019t ready to do it today.","Dan McKenzie","Okay, understood. And then, secondly here, a number of experts are ratcheting down their economic outlook for the UK next year, so just a couple of questions here. I am just wondering if you can remind us what percent of United\u2019s revenue is tied to the UK. And then secondly, how the capacity reductions across the Atlantic are being targeted specifically?","Scott Kirby","I don\u2019t actually know what our percentage across Atlantic. I am glad to have now at airline that doesn\u2019t have essentially a hub there where I was before. But it\u2019s obviously much smaller. And on the specifics of the capacity reductions, again that\u2019s work that\u2019s ongoing right now for 2017, so left away; 4.7% of revenue.","Operator","From JP Morgan we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","This first one I\u2019ll just throw out there to whomever would like to take it. When standalone United incurred significant labor cost escalation back in 1999, it isn\u2019t clear that any return on that investment was ever achieved. So, here we are whatever, 17 years later, labor costs are once again rising at a material rate. Is there anything different about the industry today that gives you the confidence that your owners actually witness a return on these recent investments?","Oscar Munoz","Jamie, it\u2019s Oscar. Let me start and then I think I\u2019ll let Scott finish, given that he\u2019s had deeper, broader, long-term experience here. I understand the history of this. It\u2019s been told to me repeatedly as we finished our labor contracts and I completely reject the notion that you can\u2019t have efficiency and productivity while also having customer service. I said that constantly. And to that end, in order to get that customer service and that productivity, we have to invest in these folks. And so our employees are very core to our product and customer experience. These costs, -- labor costs are market based costly to your point. Where the difference we are counting on is that over time this collaborative relationship we are building with our labor workforce, we can drive productivity. In fact, we\u2019re in this together. And some will call that na\u00efve, some will call that history doesn\u2019t prove that but I think we are already seeing those green shoots as we say around that. But that\u2019s been my focus. Now I have experts that are going to help us to do that. So, Scott would you have something to add?","Scott Kirby","Sure, I agree with everything Oscar said. And we are a service business and our people make the airline run successfully every day, how they interact with our customers is most important thing that we do. One of the things that I am proud of as having been a part of in the industry is getting to the point where we can start getting back to our people, we can do great things for our people in contracts after the 15 years that they have been through and the post 9\/11 era furloughs and concessions and losing system [ph]. And so, it\u2019s rewarding to be able to actually give the kinds of raises and economic benefits back to people after all that they can do. I do think the industry is different today and I think it\u2019s important to not only do great things for our people but for our customers and our shareholders, all those things happen to go together. I think 1999 is probably not the first example of time to use, because we all know what happened in 2001 and that really triggered all of the negative things that happened to airline employees over the next 15 years. We\u2019re past that and we are moving forward. I think we can do the kinds of things we have done with these contracts for our people which is fantastic and still get to a role where we have a margins that are higher than they are today and do great things for our shareholders as well. We will talk some more about some of those targets at Investor Day but we\u2019re looking forward to that but we are all genuinely happy for our people that we can offer them these kinds of various contracts.","Jamie Baker","And Scott a follow-up, and this touches on I guess Helane\u2019s question before. If you were to rank order the catalysts that are driving domestic RASM improvement, how would that look; is it tighter aggregate supply followed by better fare fencing, followed by increases to base fares or is it cessation of advantage fares, revisions to AP requirements that sort of thing? We all know what the various levers are and I am not asking you to name names. I am just wondering at the industry level what\u2019s really driving the improvement.","Scott Kirby","So, I\u2019m going to break it down exactly the way you described it, but I\u2019ll take a step back and say what\u2019s happened really starting with deregulation and came to a head a few years ago that the way we fence the product, sell the product, differentiate the product, changed. And it used to be that we get use fare fences, Saturday night stays to segment the product between business travelers and leisure travelers, and we can\u2019t anymore. And the growth of low cost carriers has forever changed that part of the business. We are getting better even in that world at figuring out segmentation and we\u2019re doing more on segmentation here certainly at United but I think across the industry we\u2019re getting better at that.","Capacity is still growing faster than demand, but we\u2019re making real improvements in our pricing and yield management strategies that are helping counteract some of that. And then, as Julia mentioned, and we\u2019ll talk more about on Investor Day, product segmentation is the huge leap forward; I think it is a new structural change that we\u2019re going to go through here at United. It will be good for our customers; it will allow us to offer low fares to people that care only about getting the lowest price and then allow us to offer a better product to customers who care about other aspects of the product. And so, we\u2019re excited about that. But really this has been with an industry as a journey of how do we -- changes and how we segment our product for our various customers and we\u2019re just, I think mostly getting better at that. Right now, it\u2019s pricing and yield management stuff that we\u2019re doing is better and product segmentation is getting kick-off in earnest next year.","Jamie Baker","But those are long tailed observations. The sense that I get is that kind of mid-August something really started to take place, something incremental occurred. Is that understanding of mine simply flawed, which is fine? You\u2019ve never hesitated in telling me in the past when I\u2019ve been wrong.","Scott Kirby","Look, they\u2019re not all long tailed. When I talk about changes to yield management and pricing, those are pretty short tailed. And those are things that we\u2019ve gotten better at in the last two years. Sort of mid-August, there was a timeframe that there were some changes going on in the pricing environment, which I am not going to talk about in detail. That did happen and I think are contributing to near -- well, it feels like an inflection point in domestic revenues. There probably was an inflection point in mid-August as some of the pricing environment started to change at a number of airlines across the country.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Scott, I know you talked a little bit about the various international markets but maybe just taking a step back, can you just talk about international broadly and whether or not you think overall, as we look into maybe next year, there is a path to just yields being stable or do you think international would maybe offset some of the opportunity that you\u2019ve talked about on the domestic side?","Scott Kirby","We\u2019d kind of have to go through it region-by-region. So, I\u2019ll start with the best, the Latin America. Latin America is going to be positive of both yield and RASM in the fourth quarter. So, we feel really good about that market. Again the Pacific, I think the capacity story is going to get better as we go through 2017. So, while I don\u2019t have the best forecast, if I just had to make my best guess today, we will get the positive yield across the Pacific at some point in 2017. And across the Atlantic, it\u2019s still going to be a struggle; it depends on what happens with capacity; in that entity, lots of uncertainty is still around Brexit and what\u2019s going to happen there. So, I think that will get positive and two of the three entities and the third one is really a question mark based on what happens in the capacity. ","Rajeev Lalwani","Andrew, just a quick question for you. Towards the end of your prepared remarks, you made a statement about I think reviewing CapEx across commitments, et cetera. Can you just talk about what some of the range of opportunities ahead are and maybe some of the things we can look for?","Andrew Levy","Sorry. I was -- I thought you were headed to the guidance. You\u2019re talking about more broadly, right?","Rajeev Lalwani","Right.","Andrew Levy","Yes, I think everything is an opportunity if -- and we\u2019re going to look at everything, everything that hasn\u2019t been let\u2019s call it committed. Clearly, we have plans; we made commitments. But as an example on the fleet side, there is a window of opportunity to be able to make changes once you get within let\u2019s call it a year of delivery, then you\u2019re stuck. But we\u2019re certainly looking at fleet plan, we\u2019re looking at a lot of our CapEx projects that we\u2019re making whether we plan to make, think about making and not just reviewing it from top to bottom to see if we like what we\u2019ve got coming down the pipe and will make changes wherever we think it\u2019s appropriate. I think one example would be mix of new and used aircraft. We\u2019ve already started bringing in some used A319s and we acquired at attractive rates. We\u2019re going to continue to keep eye out for high quality used aircraft to blend into the mix of the fleet here. So, wherever we can find those types of opportunities to reduce capital intensity, we\u2019re going to try and take advantage of that. So nothing specific to talk about at the moment. We\u2019ll talk to you again on November 15th and if there is changes to be made, we will discuss at that time.","Operator","From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Scott, a few years ago, you said 87% of your customers at American flew less than one time a year and represented about half of your revenue, or about -- the flip side of that, making up half of your revenue. So, can you say, did those statistics look materially different at United? Have you had a chance to study that customer base?","Scott Kirby","So, somebody has showed me the number and I\u2019ve looked at it little different but it\u2019s 85% here. And it is close to half the revenue.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then just to stay with you, Scott; sorry to the others and look forward to spending more time with you in November. With respect to your regional aircraft strategy, you had a captive regional at American. Just with respect to your early impressions, is it fair to say that United has not been as proactive as it could have been from a regional aircraft strategy? If we look back over the last few quarters, regional capacity is down materially and you are growing on the mainline. And I am just wondering is this optimal\/ideal or has this been a function of supply constraints on the regional side?","Scott Kirby","Our constraints on regional side at United are about the pilot contract and the scope. And we are growing it but we will be getting to the scope maximum. I think it\u2019s fair to also say that one of the things we will likely do over time is use our regional supply and more of what you would think of a traditional regional markets and less in big markets. So, today we fly a lot of hub-to-hub between Dallas and Chicago or between Denver and Dallas; we fly regional jets. And that\u2019s something that is unique about United that will likely change. In hub-to-hub markets, we\u2019ll fly bigger airplanes and we\u2019ll use our originals to go fly into places that are smaller cities but that generate higher yielding connecting revenues for the network. I do think it\u2019s an opportunity.","Andrew Levy","Can I add? This is Andrew. Let me add, we -- Duane, there has been a plan in place for a while to reduce the number of 50-seaters for economic reasons. And so, I think part of what you are seeing is just that plan continuing to play itself out as 50-seaters are reduced. So, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve been less proactive. I think there is a plan. We\u2019re in the middle of reshaping regional fleet and that will continue as we move forward in the next several quarters.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then, just wanted to touch on Brazil. One of your competitors noted a 30% RASM increase in the third quarter. The shape of their capacity is a little bit different than the shape of yours, but wonder if you could comment what your RASM was up in Brazil and specifically how much of that was in August Olympic spike, versus a steady trend over the course of the quarter?","Scott Kirby","Well, not that I focus on trying to beat the guys in Atlanta, I did by the way but that was about 31%. And a big chunk of that was the -- would have been the Olympic -- I don\u2019t know the exact number here at United. But as we look out to the fourth quarter, at least we expect yields to be somewhere between 20% and 30%. So, I think that\u2019s a real recovery. The Olympics gave us that kick start but it also led -- maybe because of the Olympics that led us to real pricing changes. The pricing environment to Brazil is far, far better than it was just a few months ago. And that happened sort of around the time that you\u2019re going to Olympics and maybe that\u2019s what caused it but it stuck. So, Brazil is much improved.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks and just to clarify, that 20% to 30% is off of the trough or that\u2019s year-over-year.","Scott Kirby","That\u2019s year-over-year.","Operator","From Bank of America we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","A lot of my questions have been answered, but Andrew, I just wanted to touch upon capital allocation a little bit. Obviously the buybacks slowed dramatically in 3Q but you did reiterate your focus on capital returns in your prepared remarks. I guess when we look at 2017, you have higher labor costs, a new fuel curve, increasing your expenses, free cash flow takes a hit as CapEx steps up. So, how do you balance this capital return strategy with much lower free cash flow next year? And do you feel comfortable with higher leverage from here or what is the leverage to keep this strategy going?","Andrew Levy","At the moment we\u2019re not considering adding leverage to the balance sheet. That being said, we are going to be reviewing it in more detail in the coming quarters with our Board and look at that where we think it makes sense. But at the moment, we think having a very strong balance sheet is critical. We\u2019re very comfortable with our debt levels at the moment and our liquidity. As you noted, we do have some issues that we need to get comfortable with as we look into 2017. Higher labor expenses, higher fuel curve are certainly the two important things. And as such, I think that it\u2019s likely that the pace of any buyback is going to be probably a little more similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the last quarter, certainly than what we saw in the first quarter where we repurchased 1.5 billion of shares. So, stay tuned. I think we look at that as excess cash and we have excess cash how do we return it to our shareholders. And we\u2019ll take into account all the drivers and the business as we look forward and first and foremost make sure that we maintain a very-very strong balance sheet, which we think is a huge competitive advantage that we care deeply about.","Andrew Didora","So, I guess with the earnings inflection next year, would we expect additional debt pay down to keep occurring at United?","Andrew Levy","Well, we have -- I don\u2019t believe we have any opportunities to reduce our debt next year other than just by simply making our payments. We have some unsecured that\u2019s due in I think \u201818 and \u201819, we have number of EETC transactions that pay down according to the initial schedules. So, I think that at the moment, we don\u2019t see any big opportunities to just reduce the debt levels but we\u2019re very comfortable with where they are. We certainly are going to be mindful to keep it conservative. That doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t look at more leverage. But as we sit here right now getting our arms around the business and trying to come up with a game plan as we go forward which we\u2019ll share a lot of that in a month from now, I don\u2019t expect any significant changes in at least in the next quarter.","Operator","From Raymond James we have Savi Syth. Please go ahead.","Savi Syth","Just a quick question on the business or the corporate side, just wondering if you could provide color on just what volumes, how they\u2019ve been trending. And also in the oil and gas sector, I know the drag in 3Q, it was a bit lower than you had anticipated heading into the quarter but I was wondering if that was just seeing the demand recover or that was just better capacity rationalization in Houston and other markets?","Julia Haywood","In terms of domestic, actually the closing corporate bookings have really been strengthening and even as we look back to the third quarter, as we talked before, the strength of our domestic routes going positive. We actually saw really steady upward trajectory on sequential year-over-year PRASM for business, specifically actually in the corporate. So hopefully that answers your first question. Energy on the second part.","Scott Kirby","Energy was down 14% in the quarter.","Savi Syth","And I think it came in better than expected, right? I am just wondering if that was -- you saw a recovery in demand and just more spending or if that was just a capacity rationalization?","Julia Haywood","Yes, it\u2019s pretty much in line with expectations; so, not too much of under over on that one, Savi.","Savi Syth","And if I may ask, just on the non-fuel costs, just curious, in 2015 versus 2016, the poor CASM; was there anything in particular that drove the better performance in 2015 versus the performance in 2016? The capacity growth wasn\u2019t significantly different. So, I was just curious as to the variance there.","Andrew Levy","To be clear, Savi, are you asking about the fourth quarter projection?","Savi Syth","No, full year in 2015 versus 2016 that slide that you had there.","Andrew Levy","2015, certainly we had a lot of the results from project quality which drove the material decline in our cost structure we have been able to maintain in the business. But no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unique to 2015, if that\u2019s your question.","Operator","From Stephens we have Jack Atkins. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins","Just going back to the June investor presentation with the $1.1 billion value creation that you guys outlined for the second half of 2016, could you give us a progress report on how much of that has been captured and are you may be expecting some of that to push out into 2017 now that it seems like the team is maybe taking a second look at some of those buckets?","Scott Kirby","We\u2019ll probably be able to give you a better update on Investor Day but as I look through the items we are running better operations that we know. That was $100 million or so in 2016. It\u2019s one of those; it\u2019s hard to go back and identify that you actually got it or not but we are definitely running better operation. And whether we get it all in 2016 or something that\u2019s going to come later, we are winning back customers; we are winning back share of high value customers. And that\u2019s something we feel confident that we will -- that we are going to get. Another big chunk is the slimline and upgauge program which I think we are on track with because efficiency stuff we are on track with. I think most -- and MileagePlus was another big one as well. And so those are ones that we know that we -- will be achieved. So I think we are largely on track with the 1.1 billion.","Jack Atkins","And then I guess going back to your earlier comments on the international market and then comparing that with what you were seeing domestically. As you look out to 2017, would you expect your consolidated PRASM to turn positive in the first half of next year; is that the message that you guys are trying to send?","Scott Kirby","I am not trying to send a specific timing on that message mostly because I don\u2019t know it well enough. I didn\u2019t live the history here at United of last year and kind of -- at least I need to have lived that history to feel confident about the timing. I feel confident that we are headed in that direction and we are going to continue to make improvement in every quarter but I just can\u2019t today give you what the high level of confidence when I think we are going to cross the zero thresholds.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.","Jonathan Ireland","Thank you, Brandon and thank you all for joining the call today. Please contact Investor Relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

Since we're an airline, we're going to go with T0. And if you're late, you're late. Welcome. This is my first event as the Head of IR at United and I am excited to be the newest member of this team. It's great to see a lot of familiar faces from my 16 years on the buy side. And it'll be great to work with all of you from a different seat.","Our priority is to transparently communicate our goals and we're going to work on doing more transparency, you\u2019re going to see some of that tonight, but also we want to let you hold us accountable for our financial targets and we're going to spend time focusing on that tonight as well. I think at the end of the night, you're going to see tangible evidence of a shift in that communication and I look forward to having a discussion with all of you.","Before we begin today\u2019s presentation, as safety is our highest priority, we like to provide a safety briefing. In the event of an emergency, please exit out the stairwell directly behind you and down the stairs. Once outside, proceed to the corner of Wall and Broad on the northeast side of the building where we all -- where we will meet and do a roll call.

Information in the following slides do contain forward-looking statements. In fact, that's the primary purpose of tonight. With that said, I encourage all of you to read the legally required disclosure on the screen. Joining us tonight are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy. ","With that, I'm going to hand it off to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you. Thank you, sir. And welcome Mikey. It\u2019s great to have him here. It\u2019s a great addition to the family and I think with Julie Stewart who's moved over to be my Chief of Staff, it's nice we have a buy side and a sell side perspective on the company. I think that sort of underscores our focus on the importance of you as investors as well as our many other constituents. ","We're doing something a little different today. We're going to have our fourth quarter sort of call very briefly and then go into this thing, we call, an investor update. I think it gives us a little more time to have more conversation and clarity about some of the things that we're doing. And I think as Mike said two or three times, transparency, accountability, all those wonderful words that get tossed around. I think you\u2019re going to see lots of that more than you've seen certainly from us and maybe some \u2013 from people in the industry.","Importantly, the E team is here, our executive team. All of you at the reception to get to know them a little better for those of you who don't know, if you have problems with the WiFi in particular and there's Linda. But there's actually a few of our young folks from both finance and commercial. [indiscernible]. There's Tom Doxey and Jonathan Ireland, which I think most of you kind of know and then from a commercial organization, there is Damien and Ankit [ph]. I hadn\u2019t seen Ankit. Ankit, are you here? He\u2019s stuck in traffic. Some of the people in the room. So I urge you, if you can, get a chance to meet those. Those are, I think, the future leaders of our company to some degree.","But with that aside, let's talk a little bit about what we're trying to accomplish today. Here's just a quick version of the idea. I'm going to take the quarter ending and a little bit of a sense of where we finished in 2017 from a full year perspective. Then, we're going to get into the meat of the matter. And I think, as always, it'll be a terrific event for everyone. More importantly, we are highly confident of what we've been working on for the last few months and that confidence is going to sort of morph itself into not only guidance for 2018, but also we're going to give advanced EPS guidance into 2020. And so, that's something that you can look forward to over the course of time here.","The quarter, I\u2019ll be brief, we came in better, both top line and cost in close-in pricing was strong as much of the industry and so that\u2019s certainly helped for us and as you think about some of our regions, China came in strong. Both November and December PRASM was positive. That's a nice inflection point, given the fact that we haven't had that for some time. So, we\u2019re excited about that. We ran and continue to run a great operation and that helps immensely with regards to our cost. We know our cost issues, we know we have structure -- structural issues we have to work through, but I\u2019ll tell you running better is running cheaper and again, our team continued, Greg Hart is here. His team continues to do a great job in that space. ","And as I think past the quarter in to the full year, I realize we all completely understand that to some degree, 2017 was a bit of a transition year, not without its issues and consequences over the course of time in so many ways. But I don't want to let that cloud what I think really from the foundational perspective is really important as we head into 2018 and beyond. And so, we did do some pretty good things, despite some of the cost headwinds in fuel and some labor issues, labor cost that we had to deal with and so we've returned value to share owners in a significant way when the course of the year and announced an even bigger program moving forward.","Strategic initiatives and you'll hear infinitely more about this today, had a good beginning and are already starting to bear fruit. I think you're going to get a master class from Scott Kirby with regards to what connectivity, what hub, growth and structure means to us. And I think you\u2019ll see a very strong foundation about what our growth plans, what our CASM plans are about, because I think on CASM and again, fourth quarter was a great momentum builder, we believe that CASM-ex, both from a relative and an absolute perspective, we've finished fairly strong and that's a foundational thing that we're also going to give multi-year commitments on and Andrew Levy will talk about that significantly in his portion of that. ","But if you allow me just the next couple of charts, I need to talk about our record breaking operational performance over the course of the year. This is fundamentally when you think of customer service, customer engagement, customer involvement and stickiness, this is the primary basic foundational thing that we've been working on. For all of you that have been following us, when I first arrived was about the people, the people who are about getting the business running well and I think that infrastructure, that bedrock has been built. ","And what you\u2019re going to hear today is the real focus of how you take this network and really make it and create profits for you as investors in the company. We had the best operational performance in United history. That may sound trite, because you guys have only been around together for a few years, but it's been significant and more importantly D0, which is kind of one of our many key metrics, but that's the one, I think probably we\u2019re most proud of, because we operate in some pretty tough environments and we don't get a lot of credit for that. We don't like to whine or complain, but it is important when you finish as strong as we have and in fact, we are one of the leaders in the industry. ","And this doesn't happen without the people in our organization and so the kudos and the shout outs to them, because they've done a significant job, and not just in our own internal metrics, but if you think of external metrics, the Journal just published there, I think what's key on this chart, if you see the progression, well, fourth place is not our destination and we're not lauding the fact that oh, we're fourth. But look at the progression over the course of time and that's the important part because just a few years ago, we didn't do the fundamental customer centric thing that you need to do as an airline is run a good one. And so, this is underpinning our strategy and the foundation that we're moving forward.","So as we turn to 2018, we need to continue that reliability aspect, but our 2018 focus is about improving United\u2019s margins and the bedrock -- the foundation for that are the first two things, strengthening our domestic network, again, we'll talk a lot about that today and driving efficiency and productivity and you'll hear more about from both Scott and from Andrew Levy. Those are foundational. ","We have a lot of confidence, but more importantly, despite what you may hear and think, the alignment and the focus between our management team and how we're wound at this is we are so focused on this. It's just need to see, which gives us the confidence again, it wouldn't -- when you think about the continuity of profits and margins and sustainable over the long run, it's key. Important to note, because of the profit margins, because of how we've been running, we're not going to stop investing in our business. ","Our people, the training, the models that you have to, you know, that you have to provide for them, so how to react in certain circumstances and how to run a great airline, we continue that training. The product is always a never ending sort of level of investment that we have to constantly balance and then technology. And I think at a future time, Linda and her team, we're going to blow you away with some of our digital innovation that we're building as we speak today. ","And I maybe speaking a little out of school, but we are very excited about some of the more strategic things in digital, because we're always going to be the company we are. We've been around for a long time. We have the infrastructure. We have people that have been around with us for a long time, but how do we transform everything, I think the space is through the digital channels and I think we've got a lot of great ideas and already a lot of things and actions. ","So with that, again, it's about margins this year and forward and I think what we're going to tell you is sustainable and so I\u2019ll be back at the end to sort of recap, but with that, Mr. Kirby.","Scott Kirby","Thank you, Oscar and thank you all for coming down here in person to join us and thanks to everyone that is listening on the Internet. As Oscar said, today, we're going to do something that is atypical, at least for our earnings calls and well Oscar talked a little bit about the earnings, everything from here going forward is talking about the future. And fundamentally, we're here today, one of the biggest messages that we want to talk about is the rationale for what we need to do to make the United network strong. And many of you have known me for a long time and you know that I'm passionate about airline route networks, because it is the foundation that everything else is built upon. And so today, we're going to talk about where we're going for the next several years. We're going to go all the way out through 2020 and tell you where we're going, but more importantly, we're going to tell you why we're doing what we think is the right thing to do for United Airlines.","So to start, as I said, the network is the foundation of everything that we do and for as long as I've been around in the airline business, people have talked about the potential that exists at United Airlines and have been frustrated with when are we going to realize that potential. And today, we're going to hopefully talk about what really that means and what in the United Airlines route network doesn't realize the potential, what are the great things about it, but what are the things that aren't yet realizing the potential and how we can return United Airlines to profitable growth and how we can close the margin gap frankly through the right kind of growth and through strengthening the weaknesses that we have in our network.","But to start, we have to leverage our strengths. One of the great things that we have at United Airlines is the best international gateways of anyone in the world. Our hubs on the coast do far better and I'm going to show you some data, do far better than our competitors and that is a huge competitive advantage. These are crown jewels for United Airlines. We also have the best alliance to participate in, at least, the alliance with the most potential. And the geographic position of our Mid-Continent hubs, Chicago, Denver and Houston is ideal. ","They\u2019re big cities that are growing, vibrant cities and they are ideally positioned from a geography perspective to be really efficient hubs that complement each other and serve the entire country. But those three hubs have some uniquely United opportunities and that's what we're -- I'm going to spend at least the majority of the day talking about. And we need to grow and strengthen our domestic hubs and we'll talk about why before I jump to those conclusions. But more scale, more connectivity is what we have to drive at these hubs and you're going to hear me use the word connectivity over and over and over again today. ","A hub and spoke airline is really a manufacturing company and it is about manufacturing connections. The more connections you can drive at a hub, the higher profits you drive at that hub, the more options you have for customers to flow through that hub. And it\u2019s exponential. You add one flight into a hub that has 80 connections, you don't just add one market like a point to point carrier would be doing, you add 80 new markets and that strengthens the whole network and it makes the other 80 flights stronger at that one hub. ","And so the key to everything that we're going to -- that I'm going to be talking about for most of the rest of the presentation is about driving higher connectivity and why that matters to a hub and spoke airline. But I\u2019m going to start by at least taking a minute to talk about the uniquely United strengths and I talked about our strong international gateways. We have hubs in the five largest cities. What's remarkable actually is that the seven United Airlines hubs account for 80% of the premium demand in the United States, international premium demand is coming from the seven United Airlines hubs. ","This is a huge asset and by the way, the profitability for all of us in the airline business flying internationally is really predicated on the premium demand. The more premium demand you have, the more defensible that is, the higher profit margins it drives. This is really a huge strength for United Airlines. We're also a member in the best alliance, at least the alliance with the most potential. This goes back to connectivity. We fly into partner hubs that have phenomenal connectivity on the other side. If you just think about United and Lufthansa and it's not just Lufthansa, but United and Lufthansa, when we fly from Chicago to Frankfurt or United or Lufthansa flies from Frankfurt into Chicago, our alliance is not about carrying people between Chicago and Frankfurt. ","Yes, we do that, but our alliance is about adding a whole bunch of behind connecting points on the other side of Frankfurt that we can carry people to destinations we would never fly to. Likewise, for Lufthansa, so they can get people to Kansas City and St. Louis and Omaha, places they're never going to fly to on their own. And that\u2019s what drives value in an alliance. And our connecting partner, Lufthansa has clearly got the best connecting hubs in Europe. Our partners in Asia, particularly Air China and ANA have great connectivity there and we're building a great partnership -- set of partnerships in Latin America to really try to make a run for the money competing with American Airlines and LatAm, but we are in the alliance that has the most potential. I'm not going to talk a lot about this today, but there is a lot of things we have to do to actually realize this potential that we are working on with our partners and expect to continue to have this get better and better.","What's also important though is the geography of our hubs, the size and geography of our hubs. And as I talk about hubs and I'm sure many get questions about things like natural share. The answer to those kinds of questions is going to come back to geography in many cases and our hubs are well positioned geographically to serve the entire country. You start with Chicago, not only is it the third largest market in the country, a great local market, but its geographical position is well positioned to serve the entire northeast, connecting to the Midwest, to the West Coast. It is well positioned to serve the entire northern tier of the country in addition to being a large market in and of itself. ","Denver is situated in the middle of the country. It's probably the best position of any hub geographically, to serve the entire country, to serve Transcontinental flows. And it gives us unique access to the Mountain West, to small cities on the West Coast, to the Midwest to get people west. It has a unique element that no other hub at any airline can serve. It's the best position geographically of any hub, and at the same time, it's a big and growing market with the kinds of tech investments that you see going on there, tech companies moving there. It's a growing, vibrant local market, but it's also well positioned to serve a unique set of markets that only Denver can serve as efficiently as it does. ","And finally, Houston is a wonderful southern tier hub that can connect people across the whole southern tier of the United States, but is also very well positioned geographically to serve all of Latin America. Whether you're coming from the North East or the West Coast, funneling through Houston is a really efficient routing to get you down to South America, to get you into Latin America. It is extremely well positioned and it's a big local market for Latin markets.","So we have these three great hubs that are not only great in and of their own rights, and have potential in and of their own rights, but they also complement each other. Unlike some of our competitors, our hubs really are complimentary. You got a northern hub, a central hub and a southern tier hub. It's rare that we\u2019re over flying our hubs and competing with each other. These are three hubs that can complimentarily serve each other. But the opportunity at United is to make these three hubs stronger and they're not as strong as our competitors\u2019 hubs. They don't have the same profit margins as our competitors\u2019 hubs have today and there are four things that I'm going to talk about.","One is hub scale. This is just how big you are and this matters for the obvious reason that if you're a frequent flyer, you want to be as big as you can possibly be. By the way, it also matters for things like credit card programs, because if we're not as big as our competitors in all the other cities around the country and you're a frequent flyer and you're deciding which credit card to get, you're going to get the frequent flyer program that -- for the airline that has the biggest service, the most service. And as we'll talk about -- as we go through this today, if we're number three in all those small cities, we're going to be behind on things like the credit cards. So it's not just the obvious things, it's all the ancillary businesses that matters well.","Connectivity, this is the key and connectivity drives everything else that I'm going to talk about. It drives scale, it drives revenue quality, it drives asset efficiency. If we can drive higher connectivity, if we can manufacture more connections, that is the magic elixir that makes hubs successful. And we'll talk in detail about what that means.","Revenue quality, as United was shrinking, United was pulling out of high yield small cities and that was really damaging to United Airlines and our relative revenue performance and CASM performance. And finally, asset efficiency. We have structurally created an airline as united was shrinking that we made ourselves high cost and Andrew Levy will talk more about this. I'll introduce the concept, but in short, we don't utilize our assets as well as our competitors and we have a lot of times of the year or days of the week where we just put our assets on the ground and don't do anything with them, but we still have the same costs and that is the structural cost issue that existed at United. The good news is that one is imminently fixable.","But to start, I want to go back to this concept of the crown jewels, the international gateways versus the mid-Continent hubs. And so this just shows two hub types. So we've just compared our international gateways, which are phenomenal, all four of them are really -- do very well. And we have great data, you all know, we have great data to compare our hub profitability to others and we are pretty accurate at estimating each other\u2019s profitability by hub. Our international gateways are about seven points more -- have higher profit margins, about 7 points higher than our competitors and that is because they are in those big premium international markets -- places like San Francisco and New York are just crown jewels for United Airlines. ","And so I'm not going to talk about this today, because we're going to talk about the opportunity, but we will -- that's the reason we will always defend every single point of market share in these crown jewel hubs, because we can't let the domestic base get eroded and still support the international flying that we do out of these hubs. But the real opportunity at United Airlines, to close the margin gap, to improve absolute and relative earnings, is about our mid-continent hubs and Chicago, Denver and Houston, despite being big markets, despite being well positioned geographically, have profit margins that are about 10 points lower than our competitors at mid-continent hubs. ","It\u2019s another way of showing it. And this is one. If you look at both American and Delta, they're at the same spot on this chart. This chart on the Y-axis has domestic seat share and on the X-Axis has percent connecting revenue. And probably the more important thing is actually that percent connecting revenue. As you grow hub, as you drive higher connectivity, you make it more defensible and you make it higher profit margins. I mean, look at some of the hubs that are on this list, a lot of -- some of them are in big cities, but mostly they're in cities that are smaller than where the United Airlines hubs are and they have very similar profit margins and really there's a very high correlation between connectivity at the hub and profit margins. ","And by the way, those two bubbles, all five of those hubs are very tightly packed in terms of what their profit margins are. Because they have similar high levels of connectivity, there's a similar point on this chart. And this, if you just remember one thing from today about the United Network, I would say it's probably this, because this is what drives the profitability of a hub. It's true around the world and it's what drives it at United. And for what it's worth, everything we\u2019re going to talk about today, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel here. This is not -- we're not treading a new path. ","In fact, this is a well worn playbook that myself and one of the person at least in here have done at a number of other hubs at different airlines and driving higher connectivity of the hub is just math. I mean, we can talk about all the risks and things, but it's just math. When you drive higher connectivity at a hub, you're going to drive outperformance and incremental revenue through the hub. But scale, scale is the first thing that we talked about is a real issue at our hubs. And scale is issue for the obvious reasons that I said. But also, I want to tell you another reason that\u2019s an issue. ","So in the last five years, we cumulatively shrank by 8% our hubs. You can see that our two competitors are growing in this hubs, in their hubs. Remember, these are growing, vibrant markets, Denver, Chicago, Houston, growing vibrant market. So what do you think happens when we're shrinking, but the total market is growing? Well, our competitors grow faster. There is a absolute correlation between these two things, an inverse correlation between these two things. When we shrink in a growing market, someone is going to come in and meet that demand and that's exactly what happened in United Airlines market. Unfortunately, it's even worse because a lot of that demand was met with low cost and ultra low cost carriers who backfilled us when we were exiting and shrinking in those markets. ","And many of the people in this room have written research reports over the years about the best forecaster of PRASM going forward, the best forecaster of profitability and the best forecaster of all those stock price performance is this chart and this chart happens because of the left side of the chart. When we shrink, our competitors grow faster and that matters to us. It also matters because our customers want a great network, particularly our premium customers who want to get to as many destinations as they can with as much frequency as they can. And our depth is well below, this is the number of flights that we have per day in each market. Our depth is below our competitors at these hubs. ","Our breadth, meaning the number of markets that we serve is below our competitors at our hub and importantly, our connectivity is significantly below where our competitors are. If you're American Airlines and you can carry more than twice, you have more than twice as many connecting itineraries on every flight that you're flying into those hubs, they're massively more profitable because they have that higher connectivity. And this is the biggest thing we're going to change and it's not just about growth. Some of it is about growth, but it's not just about growth. We'll talk about re-banking hubs. Again, the whole idea of re-banking hubs is not new territory. It's territory that at least some of us have been down before and it's a well worn playbook that we've used in the past. ","Connectivity, I keep harping on connectivity and I got another example here. And this is the re-banking. So in Houston, we've gone from a ten bank structure to an eight bank structure and what that means is we didn't add any flights, but we\u2019re just keeping the number of flights the same, we concentrated into bigger peaks and I just have one example here. Our Las Vegas flight now has 21% more connections. This is the magic of making a hub work, because we now have 10 new destinations and either on peak demand days, we can yield up and we can spill off some of the lower fare traffic. ","And on off peak days, we can run higher load factors. We've accessed a whole new pool of demand without even changing anything about the number of flights that we have, a whole new set of demand that's available and this isn't of course just one flight. You multiply this across all 500 flights in the hub and all 500 flights are getting another ten or so connections, significant change in the profitability of the hub. This is the key for United going forward. We have to fix this and we have to make this better, if we want our margins in these mid-continent hubs to close the gap to our competitors. ","You can see by the time we get to the end of the year, this isn't on day one, this isn\u2019t for the full year, by the time we get to the end of this year, the combination of some growth, but also a lot of restructuring that we're doing at our three mid-continent hubs is going to drive 21% higher connectivity in Houston and 15% higher connectivity in Chicago and Denver. This really is a big deal to the profitability of United, not just this year and next year, but for the long term and particularly as we continue to grow this.","Revenue quality also matters. To orientate this slide, we've divided the country into large, medium and small markets and shown you the yield and show you how many passengers we have, what percentage of our passengers come from these and what percentage of our competitors passengers come here. What you can see is they were a lot smaller in the small markets. We have fewer percentage \u2013 we have 26% of our passengers coming in small markets and our competitors have 30. Conversely, we are largest. 40% of our revenue is coming in large markets, which have the lowest yield. ","This wasn't true 15 or 20 years ago. When Chicago to Laguardia would have been the example of a really high yield market, but in a world with lots of low cost carriers, it's not a high yield market anymore. Rochester to Laguardia is a high yield market, but Chicago to Laguardia is no longer a high yield market and we are disproportionately exposed to large, low yield markets and we did that to ourselves in the past six or seven years. This did not look like this in times past. And what happened at United is United was shrinking and frankly shrinking because they're getting pressure from rooms like this to shrink. And as United was shrinking, what United did was took the regional jets out of markets like Rochester, Minnesota and put them into markets like Newark, Atlanta and DFW to Chicago and that caused three damaging effects at United Airlines. ","First, we lost that high yield traffic from Rochester that used to support the whole network. Second, we put regional jets into competition with American and Delta where they were flying mainline equipment and we lost customers who used to fly us and now we pushed them to our competitors, because they didn't like the product. And third, we had employees who were screaming at us, this is stupid, why are you doing this, and we alienated them and they were right, they were right that we shouldn\u2019t have been doing that. ","And so we had three bad effects that happened as we took regional jets out of the kinds of markets they should fly, the small cities with high yields and put them in competitive large markets. And this is something that we can fix and address. When we talk about natural sure, I'll come back to a lot of examples like this, probably during the Q&A, but this is really one of the key elements for driving higher revenues that United is getting us back exposed to our fair share of these markets that we pulled out of over the last five or six years. ","And then finally, the fourth element that I had in talking about the network is really a point on asset efficiency and Andrew Levy is going to talk a lot more about CASM and I won't steal his punch lines, because they're great and the numbers are really good, but a lot of the reasons that United structurally has higher costs than our competitors is a whole bunch of stuff around asset efficiency. And I\u2019ve just picked one chart to put on here and what this is, is, it graphs our monthly service compared to our largest month. So, August is our peak flying month and so how much do we fly in other months compared to August. ","And what you can see is again as United was coming under pressure to shrink, United shrink in a way that maximized RASM. Our RASM is lower in January than it is in July and August. And if you just want to maximize RASM, shrink in January, shrink in February and that's what happened in United. And you can see, in January for example, we went from 88% of average or 88% of August down to 78%, 10 point decline in January. And that's good for RASM, but it\u2019s terrible for CASM, because we have exactly the same number of gates in January as we have in August. We have exactly the same number of airplanes and we have almost exactly the same number of employees. We try to mitigate this with voluntary leaves of absence and things, but this is a job for people. You can get 22% of your workforce to say, I don't want to come to work for the month of January. And so we -- our fixed cost structure is basically the same in January as it is in August, but we're producing 22% fewer ASMs. ","Another way to think about this, another example because we've started this already, we started this in the fourth quarter. We added back service from Dallas to Sao Paulo on Tuesday and Wednesdays. When Brazil cratered, we canceled Tuesdays and Wednesdays. We put it five days a week, canceled Tuesdays and Wednesdays. We knew adding it back on Tuesday and Wednesday was going to be lower RASM. And in fact, it came in actually a little better than our forecast, but it came in with RASM that was 17% below average. ","So our RASM was lower, because we flew Dallas Sao Paulo on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. But the CASM on that flight was even conservatively estimated over 40% lower, because the airplane was free. The gates were free. The slots were free. We had all of those fixed assets and people is even another area that was probably not even adequately represented in our CASM number because that crew that flew down on Monday instead of coming home, now has to stay till Thursday. We have to get them hotels. A lot of times, we have to pay them guarantee pay, because they don't get enough hours and they stay over in Sao Paulo. ","They don't want to be there \u2013 if they wind up staying over in Sao Paulo for several days, we get them hotels, we pay them guarantee and then the crew that would have taken the airplane back on Thursday also has to stay over, because it's created a chain of events that you've got to wait for each crew to bring the airplane home and you just never catch up. And so this kind of behavior, if all you want to do is maximize RASM, man, this is the way to do it. But if you want to maximize profitability, it's damaging, because the CASM impact is so much bigger than the RASM impact. ","So going forward, we're going to measure ourselves on these four metrics from the network perspective. We've got a whole bunch of more metrics, but hub scale, so one way to think about that is the amount of spokes, where we're ranked number one or two. Again, this matters I\u2019ve alluded to the credit card a couple of times, this matters not just for the obvious of winning customers, but if you're in Kansas City and there's no hub there and you're picking \u2013 you\u2019re a frequent flyer and you're picking who to fly, you're going to probably pick the airline that's number one in that city, because they can get you the most places. When you live in Kansas City, you almost always have to make a connection anywhere that you're going. ","And if you're going to have to make a connection anyway, you can connect in Dallas or Houston or Chicago or Minneapolis and you're going to connect with the carrier that has the highest service. And that matters to our passenger revenue, but it also matters to all of our ancillary revenues. Connectivity, this is again the number one issue, the number one thing for us to drive is higher connectivity across the network. And it's not just about growth, it's also about structure and this is something we absolutely can do and again, it's just math. This is really hard to debate that it works, because it's just math as you exponentially increase the connectivity of a hub when you grow it. ","Revenue share in small city markets, I talked about that, we\u2019ll continue to access more of those as we move forward. And then of course asset efficiency and Andrew Levy is going to talk more about what that means for our CASM and particular he's going to get to what that means for our near term EPS guide in 2018, but also an EPS guide for 2020 as well. And all of that is going to lead to improvement in our pre-tax margins, both absolute and relative. And this is a different way of talking about it than we did a year ago, but this is the issue. The network is the issue. ","And if you want to and understand an airline and understand what their profit potential is for the long term, you have to understand the network. That's why we spend a lot of time on this today because this is what's going to get United, make United great again. This is what is going to drive margins at United Airlines in both an absolute and a relative sense, but that then gets us to the bottom line, which is our growth rate. And we are planning to grow this year, as we start to repair some of this and as we focus on our mid-continent hubs, we're planning to grow 4% to 6%. And we expect to grow at similar rates in 2019 and 20. ","I also, while I\u2019m on this slide want to make a personal commentary. I've known many of you at least for 15, 20 or more years. And I think my reputation with you is, one, I've been probably the most hawkish person in the industry in terms of pushing for -- aggressively pushing for and driving consolidation, because I knew what kind of value that would create. I also had a history I think of being a capacity hawk and cutting unprofitable flying and I absolutely have done that in the past and would do that if we had unprofitable flying at United Airlines today. In fact, it's not something I'm proud of, but it was the right thing to do financially. ","I've been at airlines where we've closed a number of hubs, but we have a different hand of cards to play at United. If I had the same hand of cards to play as I've had at other airlines, where we had unprofitable operations that we needed to shrink, that's what we would have done. But we have a different hand of cards to play at United. The opportunity at United is not about shrinking. The opportunity at United is about growing back to where United frankly should have been had it not went to negative 8% growth across the last several years. ","And restoring the position, we're building back that chart that I showed earlier, moving United Airlines from the lower left and up into the right and driving higher connectivity and share in those three mid-continent hubs is the key to making United\u2019s profit margins higher. And that's why we're doing this. We're doing this because that's what works and we know that's what works again. Those three hubs, it's really about math and that's why we're here today to talk to you about that.","And with that, I'll introduce Andrew so I\u2019ve focus just on the network. There also are a lot of great things going on in the network or at the company that aren't just about the network. So commercial initiatives that are going to drive higher revenues compared to what they otherwise would have been. And I'm going to turn it over to Andrew to spend some time talking about all those.","Andrew Nocella","Thanks, Scott. There I am. So as Scott said, the network is the really center of where we started this from, but we know all the commercial activities that surround network need to be worked in harmony for the network to achieve its potential and in particular, we know that our customer initiatives need to be ongoing as well and we have a lot of customer initiatives coming through the pipeline. So today, we're not really going to focus on those things, but I want to make it clear that those are ongoing and at the appropriate point in time, we'll discuss them. Today, I really want to focus on the revenue management and pricing area and customer segmentation. That is an important area of focus for the company and a lot is going on on that front.","So in particular, Gemini, Gemini is our new revenue management system. We just turned it on and I want to talk about what it means to United Airlines and why it's so important. First of all, the very first chart on the left here is the forecast bias. So, Orion, which is a system that United's used for decades at this point, a couple of decades, just constantly under forecast demand and that's -- you can see the negative bar here under Orion. So what that meant is that we are constantly expecting the demand to our flights to be low. So our inventory access was open and we accepted lower yield passengers more often than we should. ","Our analysts did the best job they could what a complicated network of trying to boost the Orion forecast artificially to account for this, but across thousands of flights per day, 330 days per year, that was just not the way to manage the system. And so we had to move to a new revenue management system and Gemini is our new one. And you can see it\u2019s slightly over forecast our demand. We're so happy to be there. So we no longer have this guessing game of how many passengers are really going to show up for the flight. The forecast is dramatically more accurate today than it's ever been. ","So our analysts don't have to artificially alter the forecast and they can rely on Gemini to produce a quality forecast, so we know who's going to show up for the flight. And what does this mean? Well, on the right side of this chart is what happened to yield and PRASM in the test markets we did in the fourth quarter? So we ran a really good test. We went on and off, so we were in both systems against the same flights every other day and it had amazing results. Our yields are up 2.2%. Our load factor was down a little bit and we drove RASM 1.2% higher. So obviously, we're very excited about that. ","We now have Gemini working across the entire system and so it\u2019s spooling into the process and by the second quarter of this year, it will be fully functional and third and fourth quarter where I think we'll see the best results from it. And this is something we\u2019re working on over time to make even better. The amazing thing about these numbers is we do have the analysts to account for things like Halloween and other things to make our forecast better. Those Gemini numbers up there are completely untouched. That is just the system running with the mathematical formulas that are in there. So we're pretty bullish about Gemini and what it's going to do for United Airlines as we enter particularly the second half of the year, but even as we enter part of the second quarter. So Gemini is a major development at United Airlines and one we're very excited about.","All right. So the next thing I want to talk about is segmentation and this is something that we wholeheartedly believe in. And a few days ago, we announced United Premium Plus, which is going to be our new class of service between coach and business class. This will allow customers that want to buy up to a better experience, which includes more food and more leg room and more comfort. To do so, obviously, many of our competitors have done this. They're out there flying around the globe. ","We worked with our alliance partners and they and Lufthansa as we really understand how this works, how many people are going to buy it from coach, how many people are going to buy down from business class and we also think this is going to be a big home run for United Airlines. It will take about three years to fully roll out across our international system. There's a lot of aircraft to convert, but in three years\u2019 time, we'll have this product out there and I think it's going to be a great home run. And again, it further shows how we're thinking about segment in our revenue and segment in the customers with each churn.","On basic economy, come a long way since last summer. We've altered it a little bit in terms of how we put it in the bottom five fare classes versus going always up the ladder. But needless to say, we think it's been much more effective as we've made these changes. In 2018, we plan to expand it. We just in fact launched Denver to Hawaii. We hopefully will be launching to more international markets with basic economy and most importantly, we're going to give our basic economy customers another choice, whereas today, you're unable to select your seat assignment in advance. ","When you book your ticket, you have to wait till you check in. I will be turning on technology shortly that allows you to assign yourself a seat for a small fee in advance, so you can pay that fee upfront or you can choose to wait till check in to get your seat for free. It'll be assigned to check in, but it's obviously an opportunity for our customers that are buying a basic fare to be able to select a seat or -- and it's an opportunity for United Airlines on the ancillary revenue front. So we're excited about that.","All right. So as we turn to 2018, we look at RASM and where we think things are lining up. We just wanted to give you a perspective on things. First of all, as we grow and Scott just showed you the growth rate, we know we\u2019re growing a little bit faster than our primary competitors, so that will create a headwind. So we have some headwinds and we have some tailwinds as we enter 2018. So in terms of headwinds, that growth rate we expect will cause half a point off the RASM and Andrew Levy will be up next and will kind of explain how the CASM and RASM will work and why that makes sense. ","And we also see OA competitive growth. So Scott showed you what's been happening in our hubs over the last few years. And in fact, definitely happened in 2017, where capacity growth in the United Airlines hubs was at twice the rate than our competitors saw. So we expect that headwind to continue into 2017 between half a point and a full point RASM. We don't know the exact number. We can't see all the way through 2018 at this point, but it's definitely a headwind. The good news is, is we have a host of initiatives. And since I joined United Airlines, I just have to tell you like every day, I come in and I find yet a new opportunity and it's just a question of getting all those ideas ordered, prioritized and in the pipeline so we can actually deliver on them. ","And here's just a few things we\u2019re working on. Obviously, the schedules already change dramatically. What we have loaded in terms of the RJ developments into smaller cities that have this high yield exposure, key to what Scott talked about earlier. Gemini revenue management is already turned on and it's working across the entire United Airlines system. We\u2019ve re-banked the Houston hub late last year, Chicago in just a few weeks time and hopefully, Denver later this year after we get through the summer peak. ","And then segmentation, beyond that, the list is really long and there's all kinds of things not only that are techie on the digital front, but also for our customers that we think ultimately drive more and more value. So I like to say I\u2019m really excited about all these opportunities. Some of them come online immediately like Gemini and some of them take a little bit longer to achieve like the Polaris business class seat, but we're well on our way and we've defined all those items and we're excited to be able to deliver on them and we think that's going to create a lot of value in future.","So with that, I'm going to hand it off to Mr. Andrew Levy, my partner and he'll talk about our finances.","Andrew Levy","Good afternoon. So now you've heard Scott talk about the network strategy and one of the things that we think are important to do to improve profitability at United in the short term and the long term, Andrew just talked a lot about specific commercial opportunities and initiatives that are going to help us in terms of revenue. I'm going to talk about CASM mostly. Now, we are -- first and foremost, it\u2019s a margin story. So when people ask us what kind of story are you, well, it\u2019s margins. Margin is what matters and that's our primary focus. But we have a terrific CASM story and many of you here have known me for a long time. ","You know my background, my history, I've been in the low cost side of the business for most of my career and those are companies where you have to compete on costs. And so I'm very passionate about that. That's my experience pre-United. But we have a great CASM story here as well. We have, as Scott mentioned, a very high fixed cost base. We have all these assets, a lot of people and as we talked about in the seasonality side, we don't use it very often. We're going to be able to address that going forward and that's what's going to drive a lot of our opportunities and I'll talk about that in a little bit more. ","Now, we're also going to give you, as we've previewed, a annual 2018 earnings per share guide and we're also going to give you a target for 2020. We like earnings per share because it is really easy to calculate. It's really easy to hold us accountable, so we\u2019re going to talk about that. And I\u2019m not going to spend a lot of time talking about the balance sheet, but the balance sheet is a foundation of everything that we've talked about and that we're going to talk about that enables us to do all this. We have a terrific balance sheet. We have ample liquidity, low debt levels. We\u2019re very, very comfortable. So we won\u2019t talk much about the balance sheet today because I don't think that that's really an issue going forward. We have a great -- it's a great strength of the company, so we\u2019re going to make sure it stays that way.","So let me walk you through the slide at first before I get into some of the details. On your left, you will see our CASM for 2017 and our forecast for 2018. We\u2019re going to be flat to down 1 in 2018. And you can see on the top right, we have some headwinds and some tailwinds, which I'll talk a little bit about. As I mentioned, we have a terrific CASM story. That being said, there are a lot of headwinds this year that we're going to overcome. Now, the first one and probably the most important to just highlight is the regional flying. And Scott talked about how we're going to fix the network. ","We're going to add a lot of regional flying this year and that is going to be a CASM tailwind, or excuse me, CASM headwind. There's no way around that. These are expensive airplanes to operate. And so if you just look at it in terms of CASM, they do drive CASM expense. However, we're not doing this to optimize CASM. We're driving -- we're finding more regional jets, because that's what's going to take to fix our network to go in to some of these smaller cities and drive higher levels of profitability. ","We have 31 more aircraft this year that are going to be fine in our regional fleet, about a half a point of CASM. Now, we're making a lot of investments in technology and that's very deliberate. That is to be able to better take care of our customers, give our employees the tools they need to better be able to take care of our customers. It's going to drive operational efficiency and therefore lower costs on the back end as well and we\u2019re making a lot of investments in infrastructure, disaster recovery, things of that nature that are foundational and really critical that we do. ","We have other costs as well, which are more annual in nature, labor, even though we don't have any new contracts in place in 2018, we have annual wage escalation that continues going forward. Airports seem to only go one direction. We have a lot of airports that we're seeing a lot of price or cost pressure. We expect that will continue. Different airports perhaps different years and of course many, many other costs that we need to overcome. Now, next year and beyond, we have a lot of tailwinds also. ","We're going to get a lot in the way of asset utilization whether they be gates, aircraft or our employees getting -- just becoming more productive and I'll talk about that in just a minute. We also have an opportunity because we've done such a good job with our operation and that's due to a lot of hard work, effort energy and focus that we have each and every day, but at the same time we've also put in a little bit of reliability buffers to help us get to where we are now. We're going to start to pull some of that back, which is going to be helpful in terms of cost. Aircraft financing, we historically had a lot of operating leases, which are very expensive. ","As those aircraft are coming off of lease, many times, we're buying them and putting them on our balance sheet, because we intend to operate them until they're going to be scrapped at the end of their life. We'll talk a little bit more about that. And as I mentioned, not only is this a 2018 story, where we expect to be flat to minus one, but we expect to do the same thing in 2019 and 2020 and that includes any labor deals, which we have a pilot deal that's coming due on the 1st of January, January 1st of \u201919, excuse me. We expect this will be the best among our peers and we're very committed to making sure that this happens.","So, productivity is the single biggest lever we have in these next few years. We have very high fixed costs and we have a very seasonal schedule. So we've kind of added to it, not only do we start out with high costs, but the way that we operate, we don't put a lot of ASMs or as many ASMs as we can. We're going to try to reverse that. Scott talked a lot about that. ","Let me show you what we have here on the chart. As you can see on the left, left to right, you see productivity, ASMs per FTE, full time equivalent employee, aircraft utilization, departures per day, we\u2019re showing to you departures per day, which I think is more relevant. You\u2019re talking about seats. And then gate utilization, which is up dramatically, 7% next year. Scott mentioned, just going back to that Sao Paolo example, the marginal cost of incremental flights during those periods of time is extremely, extremely low and we have a lot of opportunities to do that. We're going to do some of that in 2018. We expect that to accelerate in terms of the meaningfulness, in terms of our overall capacity, growth rates in 2019 and 2020 and we're very excited about the ability to better use our assets and become more efficient and drive a better CASM story going forward.","So capital expenditures, on the left hand side, you'll see where we came out in 2017, 4.7 as we had guided and we had also talked to you about this in the third quarter was that we thought we'd be at about $1 billion less in 2018. So we're renewing our commitment to you on that. That being said, we continue to grow the business. We're investing in fleet. We're also, by the way, becoming more capital efficient, not just through productivity, but also because we're going to continue to bring on used aircraft in two different ways. First is buying aircraft off lease, where the opportunity presents itself. ","Last year, we bought 46 aircraft off lease. This year, we have about 60 that are coming off lease. We probably won't buy all 60. It will depend on the economics of each transaction, but that's a very efficient way to add to the fleet or to keep airplanes in the fleet instead of buying used -- new airplanes, it's much less capital, very efficient and the best used airplanes out there are the ones we've been operating since birth. So I expect that will continue. So we\u2019ll continue to move aircraft onto the balance sheet off of operating lease as those opportunities present themselves. ","We're also adding used airplanes. You've heard me talk about that a long time. I love used airplanes. And as many of you know, 24 scheduled airplanes this year. 2018, three of them are actually widebodies. We recently signed a deal to bring on 3 767-300 ER airplanes. There will be many more user aircraft to talk about as time goes on and as we continue to take advantage of the spot market.","Non- aircraft CapEx is going to continue to rise this year. Actually, it was kind of flat, but we expect it to rise in \u201918, \u201919 and \u201920. And that's as we continue to invest in our product with Polaris, clubs, the customer experience, our people, technology, tools that enable them to do a better job for our customers and at the same time investing in infrastructure, whether it's bag systems, gates, but also in many cases, it's just deferred CapEx, that just CapEx that didn't -- wasn't spent back when times were much tougher and we didn't have the balance sheet strength. So we're still digging out of that hole that will take us a long time, but there's a lot of capital that we will continue to spend in those areas, which we think are very, very important. Oh, by the way, one other comment, 2019 to 2020, we expect that we\u2019ll be lower or excuse me, that will be higher than 2018, but lower than 2017. 2017 will still represent the high watermark we expect at this time. ","So, there's a lot going on in this chart. Let me first start out by saying that we all, I think, are enjoying a great market. There's no signs of weakness out there. The whole world is booming, which is exactly why we need to be probably vigilant and make sure we know how to manage through the eventual downturn, which will come at some point in time. As you can see here, I'm showing you year-end 2017 mainline aircraft in our fleet. And then where we expect to be by the end of 2020 and where we could be by the end of 2020. If we are going to utilize the levers that we've created for ourselves to manage our fleet plan, we have a lot of flexibility. ","We've talked about that repeatedly about the flexibility we have with our order book at our fleet. We think that is one of the most important things that we have to manage through tougher times, apart from a terrific balance sheet, which I already touched on. But we can manage our fleet. This is critically important and the other thing that we can do to manage our fleet is continue to bring on lower cost airplanes. And again, you've seen me do that before. It's very effective. It gives you a lot more flexibility in the case of a downturn and we think that's critically important as we go forward.","So, here's the punch line. 2018 guidance, we're giving you an annual number as we\u2019ve already previewed. Scott talked to you about capacity, 4% to 6%. CASM-ex, minus 1% to flat, we're all incredibly committed to delivering on that. We expect an earnings per share range of $6.50 to $7.50 and we touched on CapEx just a minute ago. We like earnings per share. We think that's what matters most to us as shareholders. We think it matters most to you as shareholders. As a metric, if you're going to pick one and so that is -- with our efforts to try to become more accountable, more transparent, that's why we're doing this today. ","And lastly, this slide basically speaks for itself. This is a range for 2020. This is what everything we talked about gets us in 2020. We're very, very confident in the long-term strategy that we've outlined for you today. We have a great CASM story. As I\u2019ve tried to give you a little bit of information on today, while I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk a lot more of that in Q&A, very committed to making that happen and I think importantly, we're showing at these numbers a 25% compound annual growth rate in terms of earnings per share by 2020.","So with that, I will turn it back over to Oscar to finish up.","Oscar Munoz","Just so we're clear on the numbers, $8.50 on the chart on the far range of EPS is the correct number. And I also want to reiterate, because it wasn't maybe clear on the chart that our CASM guide does include labor deals. And I do believe that from a transparency and a forward aspect, I don't know that anyone in the industry has ever sort of done them. And that's the level of cost management that we\u2019re going to be going after.","So with that, let me just bring it home before we get into Q&A. When I took this job, some of you in this room, a lot of people in the business talked about United being sort of the unsolvable puzzle. There was assets and resources and a global footprint that had great promise, but nobody had ever been able to figure out how to actually put that together. And so one of the first tasks we took out is how do we create a team around that with the smartest capable minds taking advantage of that and that's what we\u2019ve created. And despite everything we hear and see and sometimes read, we've got a plan that we're very, very confident about. ","You heard that strengthening our hubs is critical, not just to our growth and competitiveness, but to profitability. I think that\u2019s an important aspect of what we're doing. The numbers we've chosen, the things that we've done about maximizing profitability. And again as Andrew Nocella talked about driving revenue on all aspects of our business, but you heard him specifically say that every day he shows up to work, there is even more opportunity. ","So the opportunity set from my perspective, as I talk to the team, specifically, we talk about the great sort of confidence of things to be touched ahead and for the unsolvable puzzle piece, when you think about the mid-continent and the gap aspect of there, that's where the opportunity lies and that\u2019s why the growth that we're doing is going to be focused on high cost business, efficiency and productivity, all of that continues to be, I think, Andrew just laid that out very well and so ladies and gentlemen, that's our plan. ","That's what we're headed out to do. There will be lots of questions and concerns about different numbers, but that is the fundamental plan and our confidence level is high the numbers we\u2019ve reached. To provide you some sense of our comfort and our confidence, we are giving you what we think is a greater level of accountability and transparency with the EPS numbers that we're providing. More importantly, we're making the big strong pivot to the strategy, not only doing what's right for the business, for our customers and for our employees, but also driving those sustainably higher profits and margin.","So with that, we're going to stop. I\u2019m going to ask the team up here and we will take your questions for the next time period.","Question-And-Answer Session","A - Scott Kirby","I think Julie is going to \u2013 Julie and Mike are going to bring mics around. Maybe, to Mike? Maybe not.","Andrew Davis","Thanks for the update. It\u2019s Andrew Davis from T. Rowe. Scott, as you try to build regional encashment in your hubs, is there a risk that the traffic that you are going to gain from better regional fee incomes and at a lower yield than it's coming at, now, maybe for some of your competitors and the reason I asked is because American just announced some additional expansion of regional feed, there's a lot of geographic overlap between you guys and I'm just kind of concerned that is this the next frontier of competition that prevents you guys from hitting some of those targets you hit today?","Scott Kirby","Yeah. And I\u2019d like to answer that Andrew in a more -- in a broader perspective as well, because a lot of the questions we get are, what's the competitive response to this going to be. And I think it\u2019s a perfect way to frame this and think about it. The growth potential for United Airlines, just like for our two competitors is really about the geography of our hubs. And what happened at United is, we had years where we were shrinking, while our competitors were kind of growing 2% or 3% a year and I expect they'll continue growing kind of 2%, 3% with GDP. ","What we're doing is frankly catching up to some of what we went negative on for years before, but it's a great example, the recent American Airlines announcement. I'll take the Northwest Florida airport, one I know that you like this go to. An American Airlines just announced service to the Northwest Florida airport. It's a really good market for United Airlines and we fly from Houston to the Northwest Florida airport. But it's a market that is almost all connecting traffic. Our largest O&D from Northwest Florida is flying to Denver and that's four passengers a day. ","Our second largest is Los Angeles and that's two passengers a day. And the reality is, when American starts flying to Charlotte, which is well positioned to serve Northwest Florida and to Dallas, which is also well positioned to serve the Northwest Florida airport, American is going to get some share from us. They're going to -- some of those two passengers a day that fly to LA are going to now connect through Chicago -- or through Charlotte or connect through Dallas and we're going to lose that share and there's nothing we can do about it. What are we going to do, fly a non-stop flight from Northwest Florida to LA to try to protect two passengers a day and try to protect our market share in there. ","It is just about hub geography and I think Northwest Florida is probably an exception to what I'm about to say, because it's still actually a growing market. But at the end of the day, if it wasn't a growing market, we would wind up adjusting capacity, because our demand would go down. And so I don't think the yields are really going to change in these markets, because if you're in a place now to pick a United example, like Rochester, Minnesota people, live buyers -- frequent flyers that live and travel in Rochester are basically connecting everywhere they go and they can connect in Minneapolis on Delta\u2019s hub. ","They can connect in Chicago on American\u2019s hub and it used to just be the two of them and they probably had about 50-50 market share. And now, United is in the market and it's going to settle at a third of third of third. And the capacity is going to adjust to whatever the demand levels are. And when I talk about natural share, that's what it means. It's geography. ","It's not some design to go take on a competitor or have an aggressive response because we have a hub in Chicago where we can connect people to hundreds of destinations and if you live in Rochester, we're well positioned geographically to serve that market. Just like in Northwest Florida, American is well positioned to serve that hub and they're going to win market share from us. But we will wind up with kind of our natural share of -- based on the geography of our hubs and the reason United Airlines has more growth opportunities than our competitors is because we not only haven\u2019t been growing with GDP for the last six or seven years, we were shrinking at the same time, our competitors were growing in those markets.","Hunter Keay","It\u2019s Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research. Appreciate the multi-year CASM guidance and you said it includes all labor deals going forward, you're kind of up against the sort of max that you're allowed on your scope right now, Scott and I'm wondering how you can be so confident on that cost guide, when you're probably going to need some give back and scope from your pilots to achieve some of this regional feeds you\u2019re trying to do. So how do you put a dollar amount on the amount that you're going to have to pay for likely scope relaxation? Unless you reject the premise of the question that you don't need scope relaxation?","Scott Kirby","Look, I start with -- I completely understand why our employees and our pilots in particular are worried about scope, because they have seen us take, as I said in the presentation, take airplanes out of a place like Rochester to Chicago and put it in Newark Atlanta. And they know that was stupid and they were right. We should not have done that. But we're now doing it the right way. We're not just asking them to believe us, we\u2019re making commitments, where actions speak louder than words. ","We're up-gauging back in markets where we should be up-gauging and we're putting the regional jets in the right market. But our plan is predicated on having -- it's a critical element, having that high yield flow come through our hubs and we shouldn\u2019t have been finding regional jets in a market like Newark, Atlanta but we're going to have to fly regional jets in places like Rochester, Minnesota or Elmira, New York or Columbia, Missouri. We're going to have to fly regional jets because that's the size of the market and we can't grow the mainline if we don't have that high yield flow coming through hubs. ","And so there is a win-win. The reality is, we will grow the main \u2013 the reason pilots want scope and don't want us growing is because they're worried about jobs. But we're going to create more pilot jobs by having the right kind of aircraft flying, having the right kind of regional jets flying, which then gets to the next point. In the past, we could fly 50 seaters and we've got a temporary surge in 50 seaters in 2018 because we don't have a choice today. But in the long run, we can't be flying in a market like Rochester, Minnesota with a 50-seater if our two competitors are flying two class regional jets. ","We will have an uncompetitive product, just like we had an uncompetitive product in Newark to Atlanta for the local market, we will have an uncompetitive product for Rochester to the world and we won\u2019t stay in that market. And that's bad for the mainline, because if we can't feed that high yield revenue into the hub, then we can't make it work. And I\u2019d believe our pilots understand that. ","Because they've been burned in the past, they're going to want some kind of commitment from us, but I think the deal winds up being, we don't need more airplanes, but we can wind up turning 50-seaters into larger regional jets, but we make some kind of commitment to them, whether it's a growth commitment or jobs or some kind of commitment that says, we're not just asking you to trust us that we're going to do the right thing, but it's not about buying scope relief. It's about addressing the issue and the issue is about jobs for them. And they've seen their jobs get outsourced and we do that. ","That is a win-win-win for all of us, because it\u2019s something we need to do anyway as we talked about extensively in the network deck and that's a win for our pilots and that's really what they want. The protection, they're not trying to protect themselves against Rochester, Minnesota. They're trying to protect themselves against us doing that Dallas to Chicago and we shouldn't be doing it in a market like Dallas to Chicago. And so, we are talking to them and I think we're going to wind up with a win-win-win that fits within our CASM guidance. So, we wouldn\u2019t have given that CASM guidance today.","Dan McKenzie","Thanks for the presentation guys. Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Couple of questions here, just one housecleaning. I guess, as you provide the EPS outlook for this year, does it factor in some potential upside that\u2019s tax reform driven or is there some potential revenue upside beyond what you\u2019ve guided? And then if you could just address, I think investors are pretty shell shocked from the pricing shock that occurred in 2017. Obviously, the guide doesn't factor in, maybe you can't talk about pricing, but it would seem that, maybe that's in the in the rearview mirror?","Andrew Nocella","We do have in that guide of course tax reform, but we don't have anything explicit about that driving higher demand. And you guys can back into what our PRASM number is and I'm sure most of you've already done it. Some of you may have even published research reports on it already as we talked, which annoys me, because then you aren\u2019t listening, I\u2019m kidding. But we don't have anything explicit in there. We also don\u2019t have anything explicit that there's going to be another pricing and I don't think there will be. Frankly, I always bet the over. I think everyone knows that. ","But with fuel at $2.11 a gallon, I think that chances of some bad pricing thing happening gets more than not zero, but with fuel $2.11 a gallon, which is what we've got embedded in those numbers, I think the chances of that are smaller and you can back into the numbers and recognize that our forecast kind of at an industry level is probably more conservative than some of you. ","And I hope you're right, but we've put out a number that we feel really good about and that we think we have some ability to deal with some ups and downs that might happen. We obviously not everything, there are things that could happen that caused us to miss, but that we have some ploy in there to deal with the inevitable, something bad happened somewhere in the world. We're not going to have a perfect year. We're going to have something most years, but we could also have some good things, but we don't have anything explicit kind of from tax reform built into the numbers yet.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. Follow-up question. I'm wondering to what extent an up-gauge strategy in \u201918 or in \u201919 or \u201920 plays into the non-fuel cost guide. At some point, does it make sense for A319s to free up 75 seat RJs, so that those 75-seat RJs then could go, free up 50 seat RJs. Are there any 50-seat RJs that come off in your capacity purchase agreements to give you that up-gauging opportunity?","Scott Kirby","Couple of points I guess. First of all, the up-gauging which has been a steady upward pace over the last few years, it does pause this year, starts going up again in \u201919 and \u201920 based on our fleet plan. We do have a lot of flexibility with our regional jet contracts, particularly the 50-seater. So we do have the ability to -- we do have a lot of flexibility with that in the next couple of years. So I\u2019ll probably leave it at that as far as how that works, but we do have that. So, our hope is that we can replace 50-seaters with bigger regional jets or in some cases, it might be what you describes, maybe small narrowbody mainline airplane in its place. So stay tuned","Mike Linenberg","Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. So the 4% to 6% out over the next few years, I mean, they\u2019re big numbers. If -- can you talk through maybe some of the key underlying elements in those numbers, like how much of it is better utilization or productivity like Andrew, you talked about huge opportunities to improve asset efficiency. How much of that is driving the increase in ASMs as well as what percent are in and out of hubs? Is maybe all that is hub flying or are there -- are you looking to expand in to focused cities, et cetera?","Scott Kirby","I\u2019ll go in a reverse order, because that\u2019s one is the easiest. 100% is in and out of hubs. Our strategy is about strengthening our hub\u2019s \u2013 everything I talked about is better hubs and all of our growth is going to be in our hubs. I don't have an exact number on the breakdown of how much is utilization and -- but you can get an idea and we have better numbers for 2018. We\u2019ve done more refined analysis. You can get an idea from the chart that Andrew showed about efficiency. Those are all asset efficiency. In 2018, another way of looking at it is, I think to approximately 2 points of our growth is Hawaii and that\u2019s still real growth, but it's a different kind of growth than just flying in domestic markets. ","And by the way, our Hawaii growth is really a lot more focused on flying from our hubs, like Denver to Hawaii and then off the West Coast, much more competitive and we have grown there too as well. And we both have a history of knowing how well those connecting hubs can work to funnel people. Again, it\u2019s funneling people through the hub and -- but two points in 2018 are from that. A big chunk of our growth in 2018 is actually this temporary surge in regional jets, which doesn't last. ","So there's every year there will be kind of those explanations, but you can get to pretty good numbers from looking at Andrew\u2019s chart on the utilization, both of aircraft and gates and employees, just to get a good mix that you look at this year and at least half is kind of that kind of utilization type of line that's really efficient on the assets. And even the stuff that's not explicit in that category winds up fitting somewhat in that category, just because we aren\u2019t adding gates anywhere in 2018. And I suspect in \u201919 and \u201920, we will have a picture that looks a lot similar, in a lot of ways similar to that. With more gauge, one of the things that\u2019s going to drive it in \u201919 and \u201920 is also gate as well.","Andrew Nocella","And then Scott, just to add onto that, some of the new routes that you're flying, some of these longer haul are ultra long haul flights that you're adding where you have because of your hubs, you're probably uniquely positioned of any US carrier to fly, say a Houston-Sydney or an LA-Singapore. I get that Houston-Sydney obviously competes with Dallas-Sydney with Quantas so for flow traffic, but it does seem like that that's also driving a sizeable chunk of the ASM growth. And again, there's nobody else really in some of those markets, they are very unique. You're the only game in town.","Scott Kirby","That's a really good point. And you're right. I mean, Houston-Sydney, I don't know the exact percentage, but it's probably a high single digit percentage of our ASMs in 2018. From a single route, then it\u2019s an example of -- and it\u2019s an example of the power of a hub. I mean, literally, 85% of the people on Houston-Sydney are going to be connecting from other destinations and it's a phenomenal route, because if you live on the East Coast, if you live in Oklahoma City or New Orleans, today, if you want to go to Australia, you basically have to fly to the West Coast and at least in one direction, spend the night, check into a hotel near LA or San Francisco and spend the night. ","But if you're going through Houston, you can do day trips each direction. And so it is for the whole rest of the country flying through a hub like Houston is the most efficient way to get there and it's just an example of the power of a hub and utilizing the power of the hub, not just for the domestic network, which we focus on today, but even for great international opportunities, because you would never fly that without the power of a hub behind it, supporting that market.","Jamie Baker","Good evening. Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. So 2017 was supposed to be the transition year, margin contraction and various reasons that at sort of this time last year, you were talking about that. The problem is the midpoint of the guide for 2018 implies another year of margin contraction, but obviously the ambitious 2020 guide speaks to the potential for margins to inflect. So my question really is, when is the transition year -- transitioning to higher margins instead of lower margins and what are the most important drivers of that from tonight's presentation, because it's not really clear to me the timing or the contribution and you're guiding down again year-on-year, when and what really drives the inflection, give us some confidence there?","Andrew Levy","Well, I think we\u2019re guiding to essentially flat next year and that's what the $1.6 billion fuel headwind. That's the difference in 2018. And we've got an embedded assumption of industry revenue and forecast was in our number, which we aren\u2019t going to tell you, but you can probably back into it and figure it out. And I think most of you have a more ambitious forecast and I hope you're right. And look, I think, you can make the case that particularly with fuel at $2.11 a gallon, revenues will come in better. But we are conscious of the fact that fuel prices are up $1.6 billion this year. And are we going to be able to pass through 100% of that or not, because essentially that's the math, because we've got flat to slightly -- flat to down CASM. So when fuel goes up 106 billion, we got to drive 1.6 billion on the revenue side. ","We got to drive it all on the revenue side and that's a pretty big decline when you think about it from that perspective and that's how we get to the numbers. Our margins frankly inflect and get better, because the curve is slightly backwardated and you're continuing to drive flat to down CASM with higher RASM. It's just -- it's math. And we have created numbers that are probably more conservative than you have. Others will have numbers that we feel good about making a commitment to you that we feel confident, we are not 100%, can never be 100%, but that we believe we can hit even when we get thrown some curve balls going forward.","Kevin Crissey","Kevin Crissey at Citi. So Scott, how does the low cost competition in your hubs affect your ability to drive the margins that maybe Delta sees and some of the hubs that maybe has less LCC competition in the hubs? How does that affect?","Scott Kirby","It matters. The best way to be able -- first the best way to compete with a low cost carrier is master prices. Half our revenue approximately comes from customers that are mostly shopping on price. And we cannot ignore half of our revenue and we can't let our low cost carriers have price advantages in our hubs and no one chooses to fly on an ultra low cost carrier, if they can get the same price on United Airlines. Nobody, at least, if they know what they\u2019re buying and so it's entirely within our control whether they succeed or fail in our hubs. ","And our advantage that we have when we compete with them and the advantage that Delta has that\u2019s better than us is high connectivity, because if you can fill an airplane with 80% connecting revenues in a market, then they're left competing for 20% of the market and they cannot succeed in that environment, but the higher your percentage of local revenue is, the more able they are to compete, because they're just competing for local revenues in the market. ","So we're going to be \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to have an aggressive competitive posture vis-\u00e0-vis ultra low cost carriers, but the biggest strength we have is the connectivity of our hubs and the higher that connectivity is, the harder it is for them to succeed. I mean, look at a place like Charlotte, no low cost carriers in Charlotte, because it's so much connecting revenue that the local market is too small, is too small of a percentage for them to try to pick off even big markets. And that's one of the benefits that we get as we grow connectivity and our hubs.","Kevin Crissey","Thanks. And if I could follow up with a second one. Andrew, this is for you. Like, I try to come up with kind of rules of thumb, things that work in the industry from talking to airlines around the history and one of the things when you were at Allegiant was that you adjusted your schedule really aggressively, seasonally and day of the week. Why is it different, the economics of that different at United than it is, at say Allegiant?","Andrew Nocella","Well, I think, they are two completely different businesses. I mean, just in every single respect, the business I was with, we built it to do exactly what it did. So we have a very high variable cost, a very low fixed cost. This is the exact opposite. We have very high fixed costs with not a lot of ability to vary them. So it's just completely different economics and the only thing that matters is that your RASM exceeds your CASM. So the marginal RASM is to exceed your marginal CASM, which drives profits, we think that the right thing to do here is what we've outlined today and we expect that it will work -- it will drive margin and it's just \u2013 it\u2019s kind of night and day from what I've been involved in the past.","Unidentified Analyst","[indiscernible]. Just looking at the ASM growth and all the things you\u2019ve said, there's a lot of moving pieces here, but should we assume that domestic ASM growth over the three year period will exceed international or is there no assumption we should be making in that at all?","Scott Kirby","That's our expectation that domestic will be higher than international. I would expect international to, over a long time horizon, sort of be growing with GDPish. In any given year, it might go up or down because as Mike pointed out earlier, you add one route, then it\u2019s a full point of growth. So in any given year, it might be a little different. But over -- if you smooth it out over time, it's probably going to look GDPish.","Savanthi Syth","Savanthi Syth from Raymond James. Just on the growth again. If I look at 2017, it looks like if I look at your competitors, much of their growth was small mid-markets, but if I look at United, the growth was kind of large, small, mid pretty evenly. As you look in to 2018, \u201919, \u201920, how is that growth mix? Is that going to be similar in the next few years?","Scott Kirby","It will and in fact, they\u2019ll start this year as we have more regional jets coming. It will be probably more biased towards small markets, but what's really happening is, we're displacing -- the reason it looks like that in 2017 is we\u2019re displacing regional jets in the big markets, because today, we're flying regional jets in big markets and we're displacing them. So, it\u2019s a huge increase in percentage ASMs in a market like Newark to Atlanta or Dallas to Chicago. As you go back to the kind of airplane we had six or seven years ago, and you put the right airplane on it. And that will continue, but because we're taking more shelves of regional jets, there would probably be a little \u2013 there be more, a disproportionate amount that's moving into the small and medium sized markets, as there is more shelves available to do that kind of line.","Savanthi Syth","Just a follow-up on the fixed cost question, is there any kind of discussion to rethink how the labor contracts are written where you can imagine close to the reality today, which is that the US is a mature market and to maybe have more less of a treadmill or more even seasonal flexibility where you don't \u2013 where your minimums are a lot lower in the kind of off peaks and you can have a higher kind of time spent in that peak?","Scott Kirby","I think the short answer is yes. There is a desire to give ourselves more flexibility to manage through the seasonality in a way that's more cost effective than what we are able to do today, but you have to -- you do have to take the employee perspective into account and these are people who live on their salaries. And if there's a -- we try to do with things like voluntary leaves and we can do a lot, because there is a lot of people that are willing to take voluntary leaves and willing to fly less in certain months, because it\u2019s good for their life. But you can't have the kind of 22% decline that we have -- we don't have that many people to do it. And we're not going to get contractual flexibility, we can just say to people big change in your life in January compared to the rest of the year. It\u2019s going to have to be something that works for each of our unions before we\u2019ll get it done.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Oscar, a question for you. You came to investors and provided some healthy targets but then things started to move around as it relates to capacity and some of the other goals, how do you assure investors that that doesn't happen this time around? And then I have a follow up for Andrew.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you for asking me a question. I was feeling lonely up here. Kind of building transparency, we use the words constantly. I think the EPS targets are the best measure as we\u2019ve talked about. We've gone through the absolute versus relative. We did the Investor Day a year ago. It was hard to try. A lot of the feedback we got from all of you that it was just difficult. And so we thought the best way to do it is just to go to EPS and not only do it for the year, but for -- give you an hour target as well. So that's how you can measure us and that\u2019s how we measure ourselves and that's what the guardrails are for us to make sure that all the decisions we make stay within that or above it as you might think.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks for that. And then Andrew, can you just provide a walk of your old CASM guide to the new CASM guide and what impact does capacity have? Trying to get sort of an underlying clean number as far as what's changed versus before on a three year look?","Andrew Levy","Yeah. Every time you say Andrew, I have to wait to hear what the question is to see which Andrew. So, the short answer is, I don't have a quick answer to give you. I can tell you that old CASM guide, I think you're referring to what we talked about at Investor Day, which was not -- I wouldn't characterize it as a guide. I think what we're giving you day is a commitment that we're making. That is very different than what we talked about in November 16. So I think that's important to point out. That was a three-year view that we felt we would be between flat and 1% based on an assumed rate of capacity, which was a complete theoretical assumed rate of capacity. ","I think we made it very clear that that's all that was. The reality is not much has changed since then. I can honestly say, I think, adding regional jets, that's something that's different. We didn't expect that to happen when we came up with those numbers back in the \u2013 it was probably early November of 2016 when we put those numbers to bed. So I think that's probably the single biggest change that's occurred, but as we talked about, we have a better appreciation for the opportunities that we have to drive productivity and higher levels of efficiency, which really is a -- that is a huge part of the CASM story. ","I mean, there's other things too. We're scrutinizing our expenses in a level that we haven't done at least in a while, I'm told, having been still a relative newcomer, but we just went through a very rigorous budgeting process to try to make sure we understand we're spending our money on and eliminate areas where we can instill, de liver great product for our customers. But we can work with the offline to try to give you a bridge, but we didn't have one prepared at the moment, although I think that realistically, it's really the regionals for the most part. Everything else is pretty much the same, for the good guys on the productivity.","Brandon Oglenski","Good afternoon, everyone. This is Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. So hate to be critical, two earnings calls in a row here, but look, there's a lot of investors here that look at the group and say, these stocks are at least optically cheap on today's earnings, but a lot of folks won't buy your stock because the belief is we're on a long term trajectory to just dilute margins and take profits right back to breakeven and you have problems with balance sheets looking forward. So a lot of analysts in this room believe things are truly different this time, but Oscar, I hate to say it, just feels like this meeting is again contradictory. I think you opened it up saying the focus at United is on margins. ","That was clearly the message in 2016 as well. And I think the problem that people have measuring this is because you widened the margin gap in 2017 with a strategy that was outgrowing the market. We show up today, it will take the strategies again to most likely outgrow the market that's based on your own forecast, it looks like revenue underperforming cost performance, so margins again are likely to track below the industry, so the gap is going to widen for a second year in a row and what is a very robust economy so where is the confidence that you can instill in your investor base that we can believe those 2020 targets are actually achievable from here with a strategy that seems for the next three years to be a repeat of what we've already seen?","Oscar Munoz","I would just quibble with the optics of what you just said, this plan -- the details of this plan, the aggressive guide with regards to CASM, I think we are very confident and focused on that and I think as we accomplish. I think what Scott said earlier and what we're comfortable with and giving you at this point in time, so indeed we don't sort of provide numbers that are maybe too high and we lose confidence. I think it's important to know that what we have in front of you is a pretty darn good plan. I think the growth aspect of it as it's been outlined and the component pieces of it and the reasons why and the profitability there in, I think are important and doable. ","We've already, and starting in the fourth quarter, our CASM experience has been great. So we are norming and forming a team that's really getting at the bowels of this. And so I wouldn\u2019t project this plan and this guide and this outline in any way, but a really positive view and you may disagree with me on that as well, but I'm not going to defend our numbers in any other way other than the details are here. I've been in this industry for a long time and I've never seen and you\u2019re not seeing the level of detail that we see with regards to Andrew Nocella who hasn't been asked a question either. ","So we\u2019d get to you. The level of detail, OD pair, ordering by destination with the profitability expectation of where we're growing, how it measures up, it's the work that we did in our summer program and is the peak that was one of the first concerns about capacity was we went back and looked at it really hard as to hub, are we better off after that summer peak of growth than we would have. We were significantly better off. And so from my perspective, as I harness the energy of this team is, is growth good? It is in the right places at the right time in the right way. ","Would that gain us profitability? We've done different model at different numbers and this is where we have come out that it has the highest profitability and then we control the things that we can, which is CASM and that's what we've done. We give money back to share owners. So we're confident about this plan and we're going to -- the trick is to deliver on it and margin contraction, the 1.6 billion of fuel that we\u2019re overlapping, I think when you take all of the things into account, it's better than you -- I would tell you that it's better than you think. You may think differently, but we're going to be very focused and energetic and communicating this in a very positive way to our company, so that we deliver.","Brandon Oglenski","If I could just follow up with Scott too, I think you said 4% to 6% capacity growth for the next three years. Is that right?","Scott Kirby","I said 4 to 6 and similar in \u201919 and \u201920.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Now look, I'm just an analyst, I don't run anything. So I definitely respect your opinions on the hubs and where your opportunities are in the network. But as investors and analysts agree to believe that at some point this plan is going to result in stimulation in your natural share, such that your revenue is going to significantly outperform your markets and I just want to ask that in the context of your Rochester example that you'd spoke a lot about, because I think it was a very right question that aren't you just going to be taking flow off from some of your competitors, so what's the competitive response going to be? I think your response was that the ASMs will sort themselves out between the competitors. So do you believe that incrementally you're going to win at the expense of some of your larger domestic competitors?","Scott Kirby","Look, I\u2019ll let you say it that way. And I won\u2019t characterize it that way. I think all of our hubs, if you grow them to their fair size, you're going to win your fair share of those small markets. And just like we will not be able to defend all of our market share from the Northwest Florida airport. Our two competitors can't defend all their market share from Rochester because it's just a function of the geography and the connecting hub that you are flying into. And as sort of Andrew showed in your numbers, we think in year one, those come in at lower than system average RASM, as you're moving into a market and the same would be true at our competitors. ","What's different at United is, we\u2019ve spent years shrinking, while our competitors were growing. And we're not going to say that\u2019s the new baseline and we're not going to accept 10 margin point lower profitability in our mid-continent hubs. I mean, that's the key. And growing our hubs to have the kind of connectivity that our competing hubs have, I don't think by the way we\u2019ll get all the way there. There's reasons if we want to talk about the specifics hub by hub, we won't get all the way there, but we'll get close on the profitability of those mid-continent hubs by driving higher connectivity in those hubs. ","We absolutely, I mean, really it is math. We will get close in those hubs and we will always have higher profit margins in our international gateways. And that's what's going to drive profitability for United in the long run. And even in the near term, as we do that. Now, there will be times, there will be quarters where stuff happens. I mean, you look at, like we have one bad -- really bad quarter this year, the third quarter, where every exogenous event happened in that quarter, whether it was Guam hurricane, Pacific weakness as you also see price war that lasts for three months and we had some self-inflicted wounds in the same quarter. But that doesn't make the trend for what the fundamental strategy. ","And the whole point we were trying to say today on laying out the network strategy is the intellectual rationale for what we're doing. And I would fundamentally disagree with some of the statements that preceded the question about our under performance in 2017 was about growth. That wasn't the issue. It was a whole bunch of other stuff. We did have issues. It was a whole bunch of other stuff, but it wasn't about the growth and the growth, particularly for growing in places like we're growing, one of the other issues in \u201917 was lots of competitive capacity. We think it was happening in San Francisco and other places. Our growth and strengthening our hubs is absolutely the critical, essential element to driving higher absolute and relative margins at United and that's just -- I'm absolutely certain of that.","Darryl Genovesi","Darryl Genovesi, UBS. Thank you. Scott, it's true that I can back in your RASM forecast, it's also true that I have. I guess what I can't necessarily see is what your underlying macro economic assumptions are and by the same token, I can\u2019t see how you sort of view your own RASM performance over the next few years relative to the industry. So can you kind of help us understand that and also try to help us understand kind of sensitivities around your underlying assumptions?","Scott Kirby","So Andrew tried to hint at it without giving you specific number, so I'm going to hint as well without giving you specific numbers. We know that growing faster in the short term drives lower relative RASM. We know that higher competitive capacity growth in our markets drives lower relative RASM. We do have a lot of tailwinds. Andrew talked about them, Gemini being probably the biggest one segmentation, but those aren't necessarily -- I mean I think a lot of those are relative tailwinds because we're behind where our competitors are. But those aren't just relative tail -- those are tailwinds relative to not doing anything, but it doesn't necessarily -- our competitors aren\u2019t going to sit still. ","Delta and the American didn't fire their whole yield management teams, just sit on their hands with your management systems. I think our 1.2 points that we're already seeing from that is going to be meaningfully better than they get, but they're not going to be zero. And so we try to give you a flavor, we do have specific numbers that we have internally. But we're not going to talk about our growth forecast, but you can \u2013 I mean you can do the math and get -- probably within a reasonable range of what we think our relative performance is going to be, given what we have said. ","And look, I know because I\u2019ve read all of your reports. I know what you forecast that we are more conservative at a macro level and I hope you're right. But again, what we don't want to do is put an aggressive forecast out here today that things are going really well and we missed the absolute forecast. We're trying to make absolute commitments to you here today. And while I said before, we're not 100% certain we'll get there. We feel like we can deliver on these numbers in 2018 and on 2020. And we want to be able to deliver and so we're probably more conservative than you and I hope you're right.","Darryl Genovesi","Oscar, just a quick one. How frequently are you intending on updating this guidance?","Oscar Munoz","We haven't talked about it. I think, we are definitely going to give you every quarter an update on everything we\u2019re doing. Our EPS doesn't track ratably or sort of move around, but I think every quarter and possibly sometime two or three quarters down, I think it would be important to give you a sense, the scorecard that we have out there and other scorecards that we have. So we'll be a lot more visible, I think, more importantly, you'll see certainly me a little bit more often with either Andrew Levy or Scott with all of you investors that we've been focusing, I've been focusing on a lot of things and a lot of places and I think I had a key learning on the year, especially towards the tail end is that this part of our world is incredibly important. And then so we'll give you the updates as we see, but mostly -- hopefully we just want to give you some good results that track along the things that we're doing, which is why we're putting those EPS targets out there.","David Vernon","David Vernon with Bernstein. Scott, I really appreciate the color on what you need to do to build out the network and manufacture that connectivity. Can you give us a sense for how the financial returns from that strategy will pay off as you implement it? I imagine, you're expecting a little bit lower load factors, you mentioned before that yield should be okay. How do you think the cadence of the payoff from the strategy is going to play out between \u201918 and \u201920?","Scott Kirby","So actually, growing the network ought to drive higher load factors. You look like if that was Vegas example and you put ten more options for connectivity, it ought to do two things, especially as we get the yield management system tuned. One on peak demand days during the summer, we can spill off some of the lower loads because it was just, city X had the lowest yield and now city Y, one of the new ten cities has higher yields and we can take the city Y passengers into city X. But also in off peak periods, you can now fill -- where you run a 70% load factor today, you can run a 75% load factor because you have more demand. ","So the hub stuff ought to drive higher demand. The place where we have a lower load factors is what Andrew talked about, which is on the yield management system, which we had a built in bias in the yield management system to dramatically under forecast. And when you're under forecasting demand, you're saying there's fewer people left to come. And so even in your peak period, you're selling too soon. You're selling out far in advance. And so what's happened now, as we've got the yield management system is you're not selling as many seats far in advance and that leaves more seats to be sold close in, which are at much higher yield as Andrew pointed out, two point higher yield in the test, but since you ran a point lower load factor, because you didn't see all of those.","David Vernon","I made I guess \u2013 I heard your response to the first question around the yields not necessarily taking ahead from growing the capacity, and if load factors are going to go up and \u2013","Scott Kirby","That was really a competitive question about what's going to happen when we add service into these small cities. And I don't think, I think ultimately capacity doesn't happen overnight, but I think capacity in those small city adjusts to the level of demand. None of the big network carriers go into small cities and try -- or any cities and try to stimulate demand by lowering prices. The pricing structure when we went, as we've gone into small cities and we've gone into a bunch of them in the last year, the pricing structure never changed. ","What changes is there's more capacity and demand changes and moves across airlines and it's not like some executive sitting on a table like this, says, oh, because American Airlines started flying to Northwest Florida, let's go cut one flight. It happens from the bottom up, because you see -- we'll see less demand than we otherwise would have seen in Houston to Northwest Florida and I'll never even know what happened and Andrew won\u2019t know what happened, but somehow, capacity will adjust because we've lost demand in that market and our system and our processes and our scheduling department will make those adjustments. ","This is really a competitive question and I get the competitive question all the time about our growth. And I know it's complicated. People don\u2019t like the natural share answer, but it really is and it really is about geography and we're not the only ones getting our natural share. It's just that we start further behind and because we start further behind, we have more near term growth to make up until we get back to where we were seven, eight years ago relative to Delta and American.","David Vernon","And maybe just Andrew as a quick follow, I commend your confidence in putting a narrower guidance range out in 2020 than for 2018. Can you give us a sense for what are the assumptions around economic growth, oil price when you build that long term forecast, like what do you have to believe that you can't control to put those numbers, those $11, $12 numbers in play.","Andrew Levy","And I think what you might have been asking is I think is kind of what\u2019s your 2019 number? Is this the hockey stick, because you talked about the cadence I guess. I think that, I t think we gave you a fuel number or you'll see a fuel number in there. It\u2019s $2.11. It uses the forward curve. It is slightly backwardated. So we get some benefits in \u201919 and \u201920. As far as GDP, we haven't shared that. I will tell you that we\u2019re not assuming anything out of the ordinary. I think it would be fair to say, so we\u2019re not assuming a recessionary environment or acceleration of growth, but we're using forecasts from companies that we\u2019ve hired to give us long term macroeconomic forecasts. So, and I'm not sure if there's another part to your question. But I mean those are some of the \u2013 CASM, we talked a little bit about that. I mean, we\u2019ve tried to give you a sense as to what we're going to do in \u201918 and to get better in \u201919 and \u201920. I mean, it's not a 20-20, every year, we're going to do that. And you get to the number, so you can make the assumptions about RASM.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Might be a better question for the board, but I wanted to ask you about the incentives in these earnings targets, which are positive, but to the extent that those are actually tied to your incentive comp. So there were some important changes made last year, where it moved much more to a relative margin expansion. I think the waiting on ROIC and ROIC improvement actually went down. And if memory serves, it was a 2017, 2018 measurement period, which feels like this would be the payoff year. So the question is, do you see those formulas changing and are you explicitly going to link your compensation to these earning star gets that you\u2019ve offered today?","Andrew Levy","Yeah. The relative aspect has always been part of it that will continue to be that way. These particular targets, obviously, we're just rolling them out are comfortable and will meet here in the next month or so on established targets going forward. So of course, they will be tied with. The only other changes I think we're seeing now is on the customer service angle, that\u2019s going to amplify those a little bit. And so, the board is still -- the company is still working through that. So I don't want to get ahead of them in what they're thinking. But relative margin is and will continue to be a big part of our long term incentive plan.","Unidentified Analyst","Not explicit earnings.","Andrew Levy","Again, I don't think so, because we haven't, but again the complement, you will have to work through that. I don\u2019t want to commit them.","Joe DeNardi","Joe DeNardi, Stifel. Scott, one of the areas of the business where you don't have to worry about competitive response is the credit card. We\u2019ve talked in the past, it\u2019s about 1.5 margin headwind for you guys. What's the strategy for closing that?","Scott Kirby","So, look two things. First, I would quibble with the start because it is competitive. And Houston where the natural player if you're Houston, Denver to have the credit card, but in the rest of the country and there is a bunch of markets that are jump balls. If you're in Kansas, if you're in any of the cities that aren't hubs, it's a jump ball and the kind of people that get frequent -- get the credit -- airline credit cards are the kind of people that travel and need to fly. ","And they have a -- not -- just like a Houston based customer is naturally biased to have the United Airlines credit card, a Kansas City or Wilmington, North Carolina customer as a natural bias to have the credit card of the airline that is biggest in that city, because that gives them the most optionality for flying. And so it is a competitive issue. It's not just about our RASM. We underperform and we would expect us to underperform in places that aren\u2019t our hubs, because if we're number three, it's harder to get, it's harder for our customer to have the rationale to [indiscernible]. So competitive position matters, not just for the hub scale and passenger revenue, but it matters for the credit card.","The second issue that we do have is, I think, in spite of that, we have a real opportunity to grow the number of customers that are signing up for a card. It is one of our big initiatives. We didn\u2019t talk about today. It is one of the things that Andrew and his team are working really hard on. I am too. And look, Andrew Nocella and I \u2013 we\u2019ve said a bunch of times today, we're not reinventing the oil. We\u2019ve both been involved at our two previous airline and step function increases in the card revenues at those airlines and it's not exactly the same situation, it\u2019s not exactly the same playbook here, but we do have a good partner in Chase and Jamie Baker just ensured me he is going to help me get this done and, but we have a very partner. ","But we've got to work through it and we're two big companies and I wish it was happening faster, but we are working with them to drive particularly higher originations and higher card signups for us with Chase and we have some ways that we have some cards in our hand to help make that happen. It really is twofold. We can do a better job with our existing relationship and if we're small in all these small cities, we're behind the eight ball in trying to get people to sign up for our card.","Michael Leskinen","I've been reminded that we have a cocktail event. So I know there are a lot of questions and all of our executives are going to stay in the room for the next hour plus for questions. So we\u2019ll cut it here.","Scott Kirby","Thank you."],"21226":["United Airlines Holdings, Inc.

Please refer to our earnings release, Form 10-K, and other reports filed with the SEC by United Airlines Holdings and United Airlines for a more thorough description of these factors.","Also during the course of our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of our earnings release, investor update, and presentation, copies of which are available on our website.","Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results and outlook are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Labor Relations, Kate Gebo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gerry Laderman. In addition we have other members of the team in the room available to assist in Q&A.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Oscar.","Oscar Munoz","Thank you, Mike and my thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're very excited to highlight yet another successful quarter for United Airlines and if I could, let me start with a couple of headlines.","Thanks to the hard work of United's team we delivered a third consecutive quarter of strong adjusted pretax margin growth improving 200 basis points this quarter and accelerating us on our trajectory towards meeting our 2020 adjusted EPS growth.","On the operational front, although as you know and obviously we are an outdoor sport and hub weather at our hubs is nothing new, but weather combined with issues related to Pakistani and Iranian aerospace as well as the 737 MAX grounding still didn't knock us off our game.","We continued to deliver top-tier operational performance with a strong D0 result across the system and we were the top performer at Chicago, O'Hare, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco versus our large hub competitors in those markets.","Moving on to another question that comes up and in respect to the MAX aircraft our number one priority continues to be safety for both our customers and our employees. I want to commend our team for their work and rebooking customers who are impacted by the grounding in the most efficient timely and caring way possible. And we will continue to make sure that our customers are taken care of.","Finally, we continue to introduce great improvements with the United experience allowing us to better serve our customers every time they travel and making them want to choose United in the future.","If we turn to Slide 4, our performance and financial results in the second quarter have further increased our confidence that we can work through and deliver results even as we face multiple speed bumps.","Second quarter adjusted pretax earnings were $1.4 billion with an adjusted pretax margin of 12.4%, another quarter of 200 basis point margin expansion year-over-year. And today, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with a new range of $10.50 to $12. This raises our proof-not-promises mentality at work, a powerful demonstration that we expect to consistently deliver on our commitments.","We said we would continue to execute on our multiyear network strategy flying when and where our customers want to travel. This quarter alone we launched 34 new domestic and international routes including headline-catching international destinations that no other U.S. carriers offer like Washington Dulles to Tel Aviv, Denver to Frankfurt, Newark to both Prague and Naples, and soon we'll be adding four additional routes to Tokyo, Haneda.","We said we will become the most customer-caring airline in the industry and deliver the most exciting series of improvements in flying experience. Scott, Kate, and Andrew will touch on that in a moment and provide examples of ways we go above and beyond to be the airline that customers not only choose to fly, but love to fly. And as we look toward the future we believe more than ever no matter what challenges arise, United has put itself in the best position to succeed.","So, with that, thank you and I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Kirby","Thank you, Oscar. It's great to have everyone on the call today. We had another strong quarter here at United. We continue to build on our track record of no excuses. And for the seventh quarter in a row, we came in above the midpoint of our adjusted pretax margin guidance and that's despite the MAX issues, suspension of our flights to India, and a 17% increase in weather-related air traffic control delays year-over-year.","I'd like to commend our employees with the exceptional job they did navigating through such tough circumstances while still managing to provide exceptional customer service and meeting and exceeding our financial commitments to all of you. The United team is not making excuses for exogenous headwinds and we're simply buckling down and overcoming those headwinds.","Operationally, I'm proud of the team for continuing to run a strong operation and taking care of our customers. As Oscar mentioned, we were number one in D0 in all four of our hubs where we have competitors of similar scale; Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Denver. And we were number one in completion factor in three of those four hubs.","United really is the best at dealing with the inevitable headwinds like weather that come with being a global airline. We're now well into the second year of our growth strategy and hitting our stride. The network plan we outlined last year continues to capitalize on our uniquely United strength and has further bolstered our connecting hubs growing our flow revenue and resulting in improved domestic profitability.","But we aren't just relying on growth or our commercial initiatives. We're investing heavily in our people product and operations to build customer loyalty so that customers choose to fly United.","We're making investments across the Board and I'll highlight just a couple that are significant and then later Andrew and Kate will talk even more about what we're doing for our customers.","One new tool which we previewed for you in the past is what we call ConnectionSaver. It does two important things. First, it messages customer\u2019s detailed directions to their connecting gate. Second, it equips employees with powerful new technology allowing them to identify situations where connecting flight can be held a few extra minutes for customers attempting to make tight connection. And they can do it and still get to deploy into its destination on time.","Tens of thousands of United customers have already benefited making tight connections and getting to their destination without delay. We believe that customer loyalty generated by ConnectionSaver will help to build long-term loyal United customers.","WiFi is another product that's incredibly important to our customers. And while we're still making improvements, we've rolled out significant new software and hardware overhauls on two of our platforms this year. And as addition to other improvements the staffs are telling the story of a vastly improving product. We've seen a 20% improvement in customer satisfaction for WiFi and our compensation refund rates are down around two-thirds because the system is just more reliable.","For the past year or so, we've been working towards a goal to get the system to a high enough level of reliability and bandwidth that we can make WiFi free for our customers. We're excited at the progress we're making towards that goal.","Our technology team is doing an incredible job helping us to make the customer experience better here at United. While I highlighted a couple of items today, next quarter we plan to have Linda Jojo, our Chief Digital Officer to give you a little more detail on some of the exciting innovations that have been and will be happening in the future.","Because improving the customer experience is such an important pillar of our strategy, today we wanted to invite Kate Gebo, our Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Labor Relations on the call to discuss some of the amazing things the United team is doing to help change the culture because that's a key to improving customer service so customers will have reasons to choose to fly United.","Finally, as Oscar mentioned despite the headwinds, our results give us confidence to raise the midpoint of our 2019 full year adjusted EPS target by $0.25. We also have increased confidence in meeting or beating our 2020 adjusted EPS target as we enter the back half of 2019.","And with that I'll turn it over to Kate.","Kate Gebo","Thanks Scott. It's great being on the call today. I lead our Human Resources and Labor Relations team and I'm energized by the opportunity that we have to support our people and set them up for success with our customers.","From hiring the right people to continuing to develop those who are already here, we are building an internal service culture and match it to what we aspire to deliver to our customers.","We believe that our focus on customer centricity, the way we interact with our customers is as important as our multiyear network strategy. All 95,000-plus of our team members know that it's not just about growing the network, but it's about changing how people feel about United. It's why the core4 is so important and why we're talking about this on our call today.","A strong engaged workforce is critical for everything we do, whether it's running a strong operation, growing the airline or exceeding our customers' expectations around the service. As Oscar mentioned last quarter, our Chief Customer Officer, Toby Enqvist is leading Backstage, a unique engagement experience for our 25,000 flight attendants. This year, we're hosting 34 events for 800 flight attendants at a time to share the why behind the decisions we make, and underscore the important role our flight attendants play in delivering great service.","Through June, we held 17 of these events and hosted over 13,000 of our flight attendants. And each one, we personally thank our flight attendants for their hard work, but more importantly, listen to their ideas and what we can do better both for them and our customers. As a result, before we make changes for both our customers, things like increasing buy-in we're provisioning and our employees, such as operating a courtesy callback when the pre-scheduling team isn't immediately available.","I'm sharing all of this, because culture and engaged employees enable our entire strategy and deliver results. Engaged and empowered employees drive improved customer satisfaction and loyalty. On the employee side, flight attendants who have been at Backstage have a 10% higher employee engagement rate than those who have not yet attended. That engagement supports many of our commercial initiatives, including a 10% increase in corporate revenue year-to-date at United, proving that a great network and great service are driving customers to choose to fly United.","We believe improved customer service positively differentiates our product and will continue to make United the airline people not only choose to fly, but love to fly. That is why we're announcing a similar Backstage event next year for our nearly 15,000 customer-facing employees who serve our customers both at airports and over the phone, building momentum on our customer-centric journey.","With that, I'll pass it over to Andrew to talk about our commercial performance.","Andrew Nocella","Thanks Kate. In the second quarter, PRASM growth accelerated to up 2.5%, which was at the high end of our unit revenue expectations at the start of the quarter. Passenger revenue growth was up 6.1%.","Overall, we are pleased with our revenue performance and our ability to successfully work through the headwinds we encountered during the quarter. The growing success of our commercial initiatives helped us navigate a challenging environment and produce strong revenue result regardless. Our best-performing region in the second quarter was Latin America.","On our last call, I described the outlook for Latin America as stellar and in fact it was even better than that. Second quarter PRASM increased 9.1%, which is above our early expectations and represents the highest growth for any entity and quarter over the last few years. Demand for our flights is strong across most of the region and we expect continued strong performance in the third quarter, albeit at a more moderate level.","Performance across the Pacific also had strong showing in the quarter with a 2.8% increase in PRASM. I have to say the Pacific was maybe our biggest surprise given all the negative trade headlines we saw earlier this year. While China -- the China portion of our Pacific entity did have some volatility in the quarter, we're able to manage other parts of the region to more than offset. Increased collaboration between United and ANA our joint venture partner in the Pacific was a clear driver of this performance.","We expect -- expected a negative impact to the Atlantic in the quarter due to a later Easter holiday, where PRASM did inflect versus the first quarter and increased by 0.6%. While the domestic PRASM in the quarter increased 1.9% on a 4.0% increase in capacity, close-in business demand was strong. And it's interesting to note that excluding Hawaii, our domestic PRASM would have been up by 2.5 points in the quarter. This is further evidence that our growth at our Mid-Continent hubs is working.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect our consolidated passenger unit revenue to be up 0.5% to 2.5%. The domestic and Latin environments look positive with strong demand and yield growth. Hawaii which represents 10% of our domestic capacity had a challenging Q2, but the outlook looks better going forward.","For the full year of 2019, we expect that overall capacity growth will result in approximately two points less growth than our original plan due to the grounding of the 737 MAX jets and suspension of India flights. By the end of the second quarter, we were short 19 MAX aircraft and the closure of our two India routes represents the equivalent of another 11 737 aircraft, a significant portion of our capacity. We expect the MAX jets to return to flight no earlier than November 3rd.","As you're aware, we suspended service to Delhi on April 4th and Mumbai on June 22nd. However, on Monday night this week, we received great news that Pakistan has reopened their airspace. That news came just hours after we decided to push resumption of our India flights to late October. We're excited to relaunch service back to India as soon as possible.","Our team has started our resumption of flight procedures and we can now confirm service will resume to both Delhi and Mumbai on September 6 from New York. For 2019, we now expect full year capacity to be up 3% to 4%. We anticipate we'll be able to make some of these lost capacity up next year, but not all of it.","Turning to slide 12, we'll continue to focus on our commercial initiatives. Premium Plus currently represents about 2% of our wide-body ASMs, and we expect that to increase to 8% when fully rolled out. RASM gains for flights with Premium Plus range between 4% and 6% after accounting for all buy-ups and buy-downs.","Our first set of CRJ-550s are being prepared to enter service later this year with client focus on Chicago and New York. We expect the 550 will begin to close the structural gap with Premium customers that we have in smaller communities across the United States.","In 2020, we expect to begin service from New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington to Tokyo's downtown, Haneda Airport complemented and extended upon our existing flight from San Francisco and building on our industry-leading service to Japan.","We rolled out our first of our specialized 767-300 with high premium seat counts for service fares in cities -- to fares with unmet business class demand on United. All flights from Newark and Chicago to London Heathrow are scheduled to be operated by this new fleet type later this year followed by Switzerland in 2020.","I'd like to give a shout-out to the operations team who worked with the commercial team to develop this unique product, while also permitting approximately half of our remaining 767s to operate in a typical configuration to destinations not needing as many Polaris seats. These aircraft along with the CRJ-550 are two initiatives focused on capitalizing on the high volume of premium demand in our markets.","In the second quarter, corporate revenues which was much closer to departure increased 6% consistent with our top line revenue growth. Over the last eight quarters, we've talked about our pipeline of ideas and innovations that drive improved financial results and customer engagement. One of the many ways we measure the success of our initiatives at United is engagement characteristics of new flyers who take three or more trips per year with us.","We are pleased to share that new flyers in early 2019 were up 11%, a noticeable increase year-over-year. What's more we see a strong engagement of these new flyers with United across multiple areas including overall travel spend, being a co-brand cardholder and achieving premier status with MileagePlus.","Growth among millennial travelers has also been especially strong, which is critical to securing our next-generation of loyal repeat customers. As we put the customers in the center of everything we do, we're encouraged by these results as much as by our financial results and believe this is yet another validation that our strategy is working even when faced with significant headwinds. Thanks to the entire United team for a great second quarter.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Gerry to discuss our financial results.","Gerry Laderman","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon we released our second quarter 2019 earnings and our third quarter investor update. You can refer to those documents for additional details. For the highlights slide 14 is a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 15 shows our non-GAAP adjusted results.","We are pleased to report adjusted earnings per share of $4.21 for the second quarter, up 31% versus a year ago. Adjusted pre-tax income was $1.4 billion and adjusted pre-tax margin was 12.4%, up 200 basis points year-over-year and marking the third consecutive quarter of adjusted pre-tax margin expansion. This represents another quarter of solid execution.","Slide 16 shows our total unit cost for the second quarter and our forecast for the third quarter and full year 2019.","Turning to slide 17. Non-fuel unit cost in the second quarter increased 0.6% on a year-over-year basis. We were able to achieve the midpoint of our guidance as our continuing drive to run more efficient business helped to offset normal inflationary cost pressures and lower capacity than originally planned. With our non-fuel unit cost down 1.8% in the first quarter this means that our non-fuel unit cost for the first half of the year ended down 0.5%.","Looking ahead to the rest of the year. The reduction in capacity growth that Andrew discussed together with the timing of certain maintenance events, which moved from the first half of the year to the second half will put some pressure on year-over-year non-fuel unit costs.","For the third quarter 2019, we expect non-fuel unit cost to be up 1% to 2% and we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect full year non-fuel unit cost to be up between 0.5% and 1% as compared to last year, which is higher than our prior guidance.","However, essentially all of the year-over-year increase in unit cost, compared to our original plan is driven by the MAX grounding and the suspension of our flights to India.","To put this in a broader context, as we enter our planning season for 2020, I am pleased to report that our current expectation is to be able to fully make up for this year's headwind and have 2020 non-fuel unit cost flat to 2017 consistent with our multiyear goal to achieve flatter better non-fuel unit cost.","During the quarter, we took delivery of nine new aircraft including two more 787-10 Dreamliners and two additional used A319 aircraft. We also reached an agreement to purchase 19 used Boeing 737-700 aircraft, which we expect will be delivered from December of this year through December 2021.","Opportunistic purchases of used aircraft will remain a key part of our fleet strategy. Finally, as you heard last month we announced an incremental order of 20 new Embraer E175 aircraft with deliveries starting mid next year.","For the full year 2019, we are now forecasting capital expenditures to be approximately $4.9 billion. While this is slightly higher than our previous guidance this update is being driven largely by non-aircraft CapEx as we continue to find and execute on high-return projects that will continue to enhance shareholder value in the long-term.","As you can see on slide 18, we spent $536 million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the second quarter at an average price of $84.07 per share. We remain confident in meeting or exceeding our 2020 adjusted EPS target and in our ability to grow margins in the years to come.","As a result our board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program. We will continue to be opportunistic with our share repurchases and this program remains a core component of our capital allocation plan.","Lastly, slides 19 and 20 have a summary of our current guidance. The range provided for capacity, revenue and costs implies an expected third quarter 2019 adjusted pre-tax margin of between 10% and 12%.","As Oscar mentioned earlier, we now expect full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be between $10.50 and $12. Please keep in mind that our guidance always takes into account the risks we naturally face, and we certainly expect to come in at the high end of this range should we not hit any more speed bumps the rest of the year.","Despite the limitations we have faced deploying our capacity, our laser focus on cost coupled with our commercial strategy put us well on track to deliver on our financial targets and create long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, Mike we'll now begin the Q&A.","Mike Leskinen","Thank you, Gerry. First we will take questions from the analyst community then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow-up question. Operator, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And from Deutsche Bank we have Michael Linenberg. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Hi, thanks. Good morning everybody. Two questions here. Just as it relates to 100 seaters, I think -- and maybe this is to Andrew. I think in the past you've been pretty public saying that maybe 100 seaters still make sense given the size of your hub. And yet you have been inducting a sizable number of A319. I know they're used. There were two this quarter. I realized they're a little bit above 100 seat, but they sort of fall into that call it A220 100 bucket.","And now the news is out about flying the used 737-700. And I'm just curious it feels like a little bit of 100 -- or 100 plus seat type strategy on one hand. On the other hand maybe it's just an opportunity to get very cost effective or attractively put a price lift. Your thoughts on that? Thank you.","Andrew Nocella","I think the answer is just both of those things. From our perspective, we look carefully at our hubs and concluded that the 100 seater is not the right aircraft for United at this time. But the aircraft you're referring to have about 125 seats. It's a pretty big difference for us and the right niche for our network at this point in time.","But I'll let Gerry follow-up on the other part of that question.","Gerry Laderman","No. I think Andrew is right that we've been very opportunistic in sourcing used aircraft. And just like with the 319s that we acquired, it was an attractive transaction that we took advantage of for the 700s.","Michael Linenberg","Great. And then just my second to Andrew. Your -- Asia Pacific as you said, you were pleasantly surprised given the headline and you were even more so surprised just given one of your competitors last week their Asia Pac performance versus yours. You, obviously, have a lot more exposure to China. They called out Japan as being somewhat weak. Did you see weakness there in Japan? Or was it more of a benefit given the move in the FX? What were some of the moving pieces that helped drive that?","Andrew Nocella","Definitely a lot of moving pieces. But I think first and foremost I think it shows that our Pacific entity is just an incredible asset for United Airlines and it's doing very well. Our Japanese performance, Japan's performance last quarter was fine. I wouldn't cite any weakness.","Operator","And from JPMorgan we have Jamie Baker. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning everybody. So a question on capacity. We all recall how the market initially responded in January of last year to the 4% to 6% growth rate. When we start looking towards 2020 and bear with me for a second here the MAX return is going to add over one point of year-on-year upside. There's the incremental 19, 73s which don't appear to have been part of the original plan. You can correct me, if that's not the case. We'll have full year India in there presumably.","I mean, it looks like we're setting up for a 2020 growth rate uncomfortably above the longer term 4% to 6%. So I can't quibble with your results to date. But if we neutralize for MAX and India, it does feel like the underlying growth rate is in fact moving higher. So I guess my question is whether that's accurate, and how do you expect to message that to investors to assure us that you've earned the right to grow at what I'm concerned some may view as an egregious growth rate. I'm done.","Gerry Laderman","Jamie, let me start with one detail to correct one of your assumptions which is our\u2026","Jamie Baker","Okay.","Gerry Laderman","The used aircraft acquisitions that we've been doing and continue to do is actually part of our base plan. So you shouldn't view that piece as additive.","Scott Kirby","And I guess I would just say Jamie; really there's been no change -- at its core no change to the plan. We've obviously been happy with the success of the growth plan, not just the growth plan, but everything else that's going on here at United all United opportunities in the last couple of years. And as Gerry said in his prepared remarks, we lost a 1.5 or so of capacity to MAX grounding and India and we expect to make up about one point of that this year. So another way of saying all that given the issues that happened with MAX and India is actually that despite -- because of the plan, we sort of expect now 2020 to be about 0.5 point lower than it originally would have been if we not had those issues.","Gerry Laderman","And Jamie, one more point. Keep in mind nobody -- none of Boeing's customers know right now exactly when they're going to get their scheduled MAX deliveries. But one could assume that next -- that we won't fully catch up next year.","Jamie Baker","Okay. That's all very helpful. I guess there are never guarantees in that -- in the business, but does that assure us pretty comfortably that we'll be under -- at or under 6% for next year? Or is it too early to tell?","Andrew Nocella","Jamie, it's Andrew. It's too early to tell. We haven't put together our plan for next year. We haven't -- we really don't have a delivery plan from Boeing as Gerry just said. So we'll be doing that over the next few months to understand where we are for next year.","Jamie Baker","Okay. And then a quick follow-up for Oscar. I trust you saw the CSX one this morning. I hope you don't mind me asking your opinion, not as it relates to CSX per se, but it seems like there's this growing trove of data suggesting a more challenging domestic economy. And meanwhile, United and in fairness your competitors as well are seeing something different something better. You're seeing firming trends.","So I'm wondering, what do you think is driving this dichotomy between sort of what the non-airline industrial economy is seeing and the airline economy is seeing. Because it's been going on longer than the usual lag that exists between passenger demand trends and underlying economic trends. I think it's a very encouraging observation. I just wanted to hear your opinion about it in light -- yes, CSX is what got me thinking about it.","Oscar Munoz","Yes. No. Listen I still follow that business a little and understand it well as well. As I listened to the results -- and it will be interesting to see how the whole sector speaks about this, because as I look at CSX as an individual name, first and foremost, every time we want to use the economy as a reason why things aren't working, you have to be very careful when you go there. I think if you think about the tariff issues and the trade issues that we've all been facing, I think there's some inventory buildup that you had over prior years that you're having sort of resurface year-over-year.","But as I look at some of the components inside CSX, I mean, natural gas being lower, they had a refinery explosion that impacted their business, they changed some stuff in intermodal lanes and other revenues are moving. I think there's a lot of moving pieces that I think have to be thought through and analyzed before we use the economy. And when it switches back to us, I think you're seeing our comfort in what we see domestically in our business in the near term and our confidence in putting a full year guide lift. And so it's a different industry. And I think there are a lot of moving parts that you have to analyze through before making a final decision.","Operator","And from Vertical Research, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead.","Darryl Genovesi","Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. Scott or Gerry or Andrew, I'm not sure who is best prepared to this question. But I think when you initially rolled out the longer-term plan that Jamie just referenced back in early 2018, the CRJ-550 wasn't a part of that plan. And so now we've had this aircraft come in to the plan that presumably and I think correct me if I'm wrong should have -- should probably have better revenue better unit revenue economics than certainly the mainline fleet, but probably also relative to a 76-seat regional jet that you might have contemplated at the time, but probably has worse unit cost economics, because you have fewer seats. Plus I think you just said that you've taken about 50 basis points out of your 2020 capacity plan and yet you have held your CASM-ex guidance at least for the three-year period.","So what are the things that have gotten better to offset the pressure from these other items? And then also, if you could just provide a little bit of color around what exactly you think the revenue economics of this aircraft may look like relative to the 76 seaters that you've been adding?","Gerry Laderman","Hey. It's Gerry. I'll start. And then Andrew will talk about the revenue side. Look on the cost side, first of all, in the overall scheme of the business, the 550 is not that large a number. But more importantly, just generally, what gives us comfort that we're going to hit our CASM target for next year are the things that we've been continuing to do, better asset efficiency that comes from better utilization of our gates for example. It will come from some upgauging more in the mainline on the regional side things like that. We continue to make technology investments that increase efficiency. And yeah we're very focused on overhead.","As we grow the business -- overhead will not grow as quickly as we're growing the business. And a good example is next year will be our second year in a row that our M&A salary dollars will be flat year-over-year. And probably most importantly is -- and I've really seen this evolution over time that this sort of cost control culture is really part of the way everybody thinks. And as we're going to the planning process for next year, we see that throughout the organization. But I'll let Andrew comment on the revenue side.","Andrew Nocella","Thanks, Gerry. I would echo -- first of all, it's 54, 50-seat aircraft that is not a large number of aircraft to kind of move the overall dial at United. And then the second point in terms of the revenue premium, we plan next year a single and dual class regional jets across the entire network today on the same routes. So we have a very, very specific and good idea of how much premium revenue can be generated on a flight in any of the regional market, because there's other flights in that market that in fact do have a dual class aircraft.","So there is a premium to be had. Many of our competitors get it more often than we do. And starting later this year and next year, we will get it as well. So we're pretty happy with this decision. And as I said in my earlier comments, getting our structural disadvantage in smaller communities fixed is a priority. It also relates to our Mid-Continent hub strategy, which is working very well. So we're excited to see the 550 into service and what it's going do to us.","Operator","From Buckingham Research we have Dan McKenzie. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Gerry, going back to your commentary, about the goal being to hit the high end of the guidance this year, what has to change for that to happen? And, I guess, I'm thinking is it perhaps nothing? I mean, demand seems to be very strong right now. Is it just a continuation of current trends? I guess, just knowing you, my knee-jerk reaction is that, you're thinking of the layup, but I'm just wondering if you can perhaps provide more perspective around that.","Gerry Laderman","What I tried to say in my comment was that, look, I for one tend to be a little more conservative maybe than others, but that's my role. But I am even comfortable that assuming no additional speed bumps -- and you know as well as anybody, over time things can happen in this business. But let's assume, no more surprises, I'm comfortable we're going to beat the high end of our range.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Second question, here. I'm wondering if you can talk about the inefficiency in the overhead today from the MAX grounding. And, perhaps, there is some surplus headcount right now from -- and then from a practical perspective, how quickly could you get the grounded aircraft back into the network? Is that something that could happen real-time, yet, in the fourth quarter? Or in practicality, would it be sometime next year?","Scott Kirby","So, first, we're as anxious as anyone to get the airplane -- to get the MAX safely back in the air. But safety is the number one priority. And we agree that we should take as much time as required to ensure the safety of the airplane and help build consumer confidence in the airplane when it comes back as well.","As to timing, the long pole in the tent for us is really about how long in advance we have to sell ticket. Our ops team is prepared and they can get the airplanes do the required maintenance checks and everything that's required operationally to get the airplanes back, much quicker than we're going to want to fly them just because of being able to sell tickets.","So today we've got the MAX scheduled through and up flying until November 3. And so, even if we found out in the short term that the MAX was available to fly earlier than that, something we don't think will happen, but even if we did, we wouldn't fly it until November 3, because we wouldn't have had time to sell tickets. And so that's really going to be the long pole in the tent for us.","If you look at India, for example, we technically could start flying to India tomorrow. But we're not going to start flying -- we restart India until September not for operational reasons as much as, because we need some time to sell tickets on the flights. So that's really what drives it.","From a cost perspective, yes, we have some higher costs that we are carrying through and you can see it in the CASM guidance that Gerry talked about. But we look forward to getting the MAX back to flying safely and get everything back on track. And we expect, as Gerry said, next year to be able to make up for all those costs. Essentially, it's a one-time cost that happened this year that we'll recover next year.","Operator","From Wolfe Research we have Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hi, everybody. Good morning. Thank you. This is a question for Scott and it's a little bit of a follow-up to Darryl's question. Back in January 2018, I think, you said, you're going to track progress of the Mid-Continental hub changes over four dimensions. You mentioned hub scale, connectivity, revenue quality and asset efficiency. I'm curious; Scott, where you think you're actually beating the plan and where you think you might be lagging it a bit. Thanks.","Scott Kirby","So, we do track metrics like that and others that we've added really closely. Really across the board, I'd say, by and large, we're beating the plan. It is -- you could see it in our overall numbers in our overall metrics. Hopefully, you can hear it and are confident about earnings this year about where we're headed for next year.","There have been, I guess, tactical issues along the way of doing -- dealing with airport infrastructure. Houston is a good example where we have a $365 million project replacing the baggage system, kind of, impetus kind of infrastructure we've been working extensively with Denver on accommodating growth, new facilities coming here in Chicago in the years to come.","So I'd say the plan is on track to slightly ahead of plan, really almost across the board on all those metrics. An important part of it is getting customer loyalty as well and we have all kinds of data that shows that we are winning customer loyalty. We're incredibly focused on it.","I talked today in my opening remarks about some of the investments that we're making for the customer. And it's kind of a snowball effect that as things are working, I guess, it's not just the network, it's not just the commercial operations, we're running a good operation, we're delivering better customer service, this kind of all gets better together and creates the resources to invest even more in the operation and the customer. So we feel really good, kind of, on all those dimensions about how the plan is coming together.","Hunter Keay","All right. Thanks.","Andrew Nocella","Scott, if I could just add. First of all, we've been saying, our PRASM growth domestically is where we want it to be and I think reflects the success of the Mid-Continent growth strategy. And then, internally, when we look at the profitability of the hubs, we know we're on the right track.","Operator","From Credit Suisse we have Joe Caiado. Please go ahead.","Joe Caiado","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Following up from an earlier question, I think, it was Dan's question on the MAX. Just based on your conversations with the manufacturer with regulators throughout this process and in light of the most recent developments in the recertification efforts, the news over the last few weeks that there may be some incremental issues that need to be addressed, do you think that there is now a higher likelihood of mandatory simulator training? And if so, what would that do to the time line for making the aircraft ready for flight once you officially get the green light from regulators?","Scott Kirby","We're not going to speculate on that. We've stayed very close to the regulators. We've also done independent work at United. And in fact we have already started incorporating enhanced simulator training into our own training programs, not just for the MAX, but for all aircraft.","One of the great things about the safety culture in the airline industry is that we are constantly learning and getting better. We do have unprecedented levels of safety in the airline industry. And we take every opportunity to learn and get better and so we aren't just waiting on a regulatory framework. We will, of course, meet anything that is in the regulatory framework, but we expect we already are beginning to go beyond what we would expect from that regulatory framework.","Oscar Munoz","I would just add to that, Joe. Traditionally, we always go above and beyond the training that's required, so we will continue to do that on whatever base that's introduced to us.","Joe Caiado","Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then, just sticking with the fleet question for my follow-up. Scott or Gerry, I believe, the next one or certainly one of the next fleet decisions that you have to make is your 057 and 67 replacement plans. Airbus launched some products in that market segment at the Paris Air Show. Boeing understandably right now is all consumed with the MAX situation.","I'm sure you'd like to see the official competitive response from them before you make a decision. But if it's now looking like the NMA launches slipping to the right a bit, maybe the target EIS date of mid-2020s also slips to the right a bit. I guess the question is, how long can you afford to wait before you make a decision there?","Gerry Laderman","So we have some time. But you're right, we would like to see some clarity so that we can make the choice. But we do have a little bit of time that we can wait.","Operator","From Cowen and Company, we have Helane Becker. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. And thank you very much for the time. I have a question for you Oscar. I think in September, you'll be with the airline for four years now. And I was just kind of wondering, if you could talk a little bit about the differences that you see now versus then when you first came on as CEO and how that will translate into kind of the outlook for 2020 and maybe into the next decade?","Oscar Munoz","What a great set of questions. The differences are literally night and day. We all couldn't be more proud of the pride and professionalism and reenergized efforts of our frontline folks and people that treat our customers. And as importantly, we have many constituents obviously with U.S. investors. The team that is assembled in front of you today on this call and for the last couple of years is arguably one of the best in the industry. And they're all relatively young and energetic, and full of confidence, and vim and vigor and I see just continued great aspects. We are putting our long-term plan together as we speak and there's a lot of energy and momentum that we look forward to sharing with you in the future. But thanks Helane. It's a very different place for sure.","Helane Becker","Thanks, Oscar.","Operator","And from Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay with a follow-up. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Sorry. My line dropped. My follow-up was about Expedia real quick. I'm curious to your take on whether or not this relationship can be fixed by pricing concessions. Or is there a longer-term strategic angle on distribution here that you think maybe justifies some near-term risk-taking? Thanks.","Andrew Nocella","Hunter, it's Andrew. I think it's a really good question and we are \u2013 when we do these deals we think about the various long-term and where we want United, where we want our distribution to be. We have had a number of conversations with Expedia in the past month or so, and we've yet to be able to conclude a way to get around some of these issues. And at this point, we don't have a deal. So we are preparing to move on as we previously said, and we'll see where we go. But the long-term distribution and what we're doing with united.com, which we're incredibly excited about and the growing use of our app, which is off the charts is pretty impressive to us. And we're excited about it.","Hunter Keay","All right. Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","From Raymond James we have Savi Syth. Please go ahead.","Savi Syth","Hey, good morning. Just on the \u2013 just a quick follow-up before my question. On the domestic last time you mentioned kind of third quarter should be up. Wondering, if that means kind of Atlantic and Pacific, how you're thinking about it maybe that it could be down or maybe I missed comments on that?","Andrew Nocella","Yeah. It's Andrew talking. As we look at the environment, we clearly see a great deal of trend in LatAm, and domestically as we did in Q2, so we're pretty excited about that. What I'd say as we look at Europe last summer and particularly last August, our performance to \u2013 across the Atlantic was just unbelievably great and that's created a hard comp. And across Pacific, our performance in both August and September was really good, which has created a hard comp. So overall, I think we're pretty pleased where things stand, particularly when we look on a year over two year basis. But the absolute number for the Pacific and the Atlantic will be lower given last year's comps and where things stand right now. But overall, I think we're pretty bullish about the environment in general and particularly here within the United States.","Savi Syth","That's helpful. Thank you. And just someone asked on the Avianca investments and kind of the changes going there. Just I was wondering where your kind of updated view on that strategic relationship was and also particularly on the three-way joint venture that you're looking to put together. Is this \u2013 is the turnaround that Avianca is working on if this kind of delays that JV discussion?","Gerry Laderman","So Savi let me start, so I can comment on kind of what's going on down there. First, we have a great deal of respect for the management team they now have in place and things that \u2013 the plan they have both short-term as well as longer term is exactly what they should be doing. And in fact, if they get through the short-term plan, we said we're going \u2013 we're willing to make an additional investment through a loan to the airline. So, very optimistic about what they have going on. I'll let Andrew comment on the \u2013 or Scott on the joint venture.","Andrew Nocella","On the joint venture, we continue to work down that path. We're really excited to bring together our network along with Copa's and Avianca's. We think it's going to be a powerful alliance that can help us compete against the other large carriers in the region, so full speed ahead on that front.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. I guess a revenue question for Scott and Andrew. As you look at your guide for the full year and think about the fourth quarter in particular is there anything that we should be aware of as far as headwind whether it's something around Expedia or a calendar dynamic or demand or anything like that? Just trying to make sure that there isn't some sort of notable decline or anything like that? And then relating to that Scott, are you still generally targeting positive PRASM? And that's it on the revenue side.","Scott Kirby","So there's nothing contemplated in the guide that it would be kind of negative. I guess, we didn't give fourth quarter PRASM guidance, but I guess you're backing into numbers based on the midpoint of our guidance. And I think, I'll just refer you to what Gerry said, which is where \u2013 we've had seven quarters in a row of being at the midpoint of our guidance. We contemplate unexpected speed bumps when we give guidance particularly the further out it is. And if we don't hit speed bumps, we do expect to be at the as Gerry said at the high-end of our earnings, which obviously changes probably what you think about our implied PRASM guide. So I don't think that \u2013 you shouldn't be reading anything into what \u2013 commentary about fourth quarter PRASM or any unidentified risk in our number.","Mike Leskinen","Hey, Rajeev, this is Mike. Listen, we give one quarter guidance out not two quarters, and so I used to do the nerdy analyst math as well and take the full year minus the 3Q, that \u2013 you shouldn't be doing that. If you do that, you're going to come to the wrong conclusion.","Rajeev Lalwani","Yep. Understood. Thanks for calling me a nerd, but as a follow on \u2013 ","Scott Kirby","To be clear that was Leskinen not me.","Rajeev Lalwani","All right. A question for you Gerry actually on the CASM side, I appreciate the comment you made about hitting the targets you've laid out previously. But is it fair to assume that, if we don't have a pilot deal in place that you should do even better than the numbers that you highlighted earlier?","Gerry Laderman","I don't want to be too specific about it, but one thing I need to remind everybody is that, our CASM guidance takes into account everything we have going on with our work groups.","Scott Kirby","Can I just add? We hope and expect that we're going to be able to get the deal done. We are working towards it and making progress.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, Scott I think each quarter since you put out your three-year plan both the management team and the market has gotten more comfortable with your $11 to $13 EPS target next year. And I guess, if Gerry's confidence comes through that's kind of the number that we'll be seeing this year. So, I'm not asking for another three-year plan today, but can you maybe help us frame, how you think about the earnings trajectory for United beyond 2020 and maybe any headwinds, tailwinds that you see in the business outside of the macro? Thank you.","Scott Kirby","Well, we actually kind of internally have a framework not as well defined yet as what we did for the 2020 where we think we can have flat CASM for several years to come, by CASM-ex and expect that we can grow RASM 0.5 point to one point higher than the -- over the time -- over the increase in fuel prices. It's another way of saying internally we are driving towards a goal of growing our margins by 0.5 point to one point per year.","Andrew Didora","Thank you. And then just a logistical question for you Scott or maybe if Greg is there. So, with the MAX, I know you have aircraft that you were supposed to be taking and will be taking in the back half of 2017. So, when the plane does get back up and running, how quickly can your team begin taking delivery of the aircraft? Is this something where you're limited to a few aircraft a month or something like that? Just trying to get a sense of if Boeing wants to give you all your aircraft immediately, how quickly can you take them? Thanks.","Gerry Laderman","We will be able to take the aircraft as quickly as Boeing can make them available to us. We, in the past, during peak months taken seven to eight aircraft a month easily. So, the constraint won't be on our end. We'll take whatever Boeing is able to deliver to us.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] And from Reuters, we have Tracy Rucinski. Please go ahead.","Tracy Rucinski","Hi, good morning. You mentioned earlier, I think moving the timing of maintenance events from the first half to the second half. And in your last statement about MAX scheduling, you said, you expect to go from about 40 to 45 daily cancellations in July as a result of the grounding to about 90 in October. Is this doubling because maintenance events are catching up with you? And if so, is there any color that you can provide on that?","Andrew Nocella","Hi, it's Andrew speaking. The fleet count of MAXes was scheduled to increase over that time period. So, when the MAX was originally grounded, I think we had a dozen or so aircraft. But by the time we get into the late third quarter and definitely to the fourth quarter, the number of aircraft we intend to be flying is higher and therefore the cancellation rate is dramatically higher.","Scott Kirby","I just want to clarify on cancellations. It's not a cancellation that the customer experiences that's a cancellation. It's just flying that we're not able to load in the schedule. And I think that's an important distinction. We're not canceling 40 to 45 flights a day nor we will be canceling 19 flights a day. We just have the lost opportunity for 19 flights that we would have otherwise grown and flown that now we can't grow and fly.","Tracy Rucinski","So, I understand that and yet it's the same situation for Southwest and American. They were also accepting additional deliveries this year and yet they're -- as you described it the flights that they're not able to load on the schedule have stayed pretty much the same. I know, at the beginning of the grounding, you were using larger aircraft to fly those MAX routes and I'm still struggling to understand what has changed for United versus American and Southwest?","Scott Kirby","Well I'm not sure that they've given numbers, but it's really simple. We have twice as many airplanes. We should have twice as many MAX airplanes by October as we would have had back in April or May and so the number of flights that you're able to fly is twice of that. It's very simple.","Operator","And from Bloomberg, we have Justin Bachman. Please go ahead.","Justin Bachman","Yes, hi, thanks for the time today. I wanted to go back to the question about the Airbus product and the NMA and Gerry said you had some time on that decision. And I was just hoping to get a little bit more clarity on what sort of timing United needs on when that decision needs to be made and whether you've talked to Boeing about when they may have some greater detail for you about their product?","Gerry Laderman","I can't actually be more precise other than to say, we have a little time. But, I can also tell you that we as we always do have conversations with both manufacturers about their products. And Boeing is aware and it's really not just us they are aware that the industry is wanting to know timing on the NMA.","Justin Bachman","Great, thank you.","Operator","From The Associated Press, we have David Koenig. Please go ahead.","David Koenig","Hello. I'm sorry if I was muted there for a second. This was addressed a little bit and I'm trying to juggle too many things. This was addressed a little bit on the analyst section kind of some disparate answers. Just to go back to those 19 used airplanes that there was one line in the release last night. Were those 19 737-700 you bought entirely related to the grounding of the MAX? And if not, can you describe when you decided to buy those planes and to what extent they are a makeup for the MAX?","Gerry Laderman","Sure. It's Gerry. They are entirely unrelated to the MAX grounding actually. And that specific transaction we were talking to the seller well before the grounding started. These transactions tend to take a little bit of time. This was really just part of our ongoing effort to acquire used aircraft to complement our new aircraft order book. It provides us greater flexibility, the ability to grow at a lower capital cost. When you think about 19 used aircraft versus 19 new aircraft, it's hundreds of millions of dollars of CapEx savings and gives us greater flexibility. So, that's -- it's really just a continuation of that process that we started a number of years ago.","David Koenig","Okay. Thanks so much. And are you thinking about leasing or buying any planes to make up for the MAX?","Gerry Laderman","Again, it's really not so much to the MAX, but we have the network strategy. And it's our job to make sure we have the aircraft to fly that -- what the network demands.","Operator","Thank you. We will now turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.","Mike Leskinen","Great. Thanks very much. We'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"21046":["United Continental Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 25, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Irene E.

Foxhall","Thank you, Larissa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to United's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chairman, President and CEO, Jeff Smisek; Vice Chairman and Chief Revenue Officer, Jim Compton; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Rainey; and Senior Vice President and Treasurer, Gerry Laderman.","Jeff will begin with some overview comments.

Both are available on our website at ir.united.com.","Let me point out that information in this morning's earnings release and investor update and the remarks made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are based upon information currently available to the company. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectation.

Unless otherwise noted, special charges are excluded as we walk you through our numbers for the quarter. These items are detailed in our earnings release.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Smisek, Chairman, President and CEO of United.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Thanks, Nene and Sarah, and thank you, all, for joining us on our first quarter 2013 earnings call Today, we report a loss of $325 million for the first quarter or $0.98 per share. Although we're unhappy reporting a loss, we're encouraged by the progress we're making. Our operational performance, customer satisfaction scores and unit revenue results all significantly improved this quarter, thanks in large part to the efforts of my co-workers.","Our top priorities for 2013 remain the same: operate a consistently reliable airline, provide great customer service and run United to achieve our return on invested capital target of at least 10%. United's operational reliability is back on track. Our first quarter reliability was the best in a decade, with our mainline on-time performance, which includes both domestic and international flights, averaging 81%.","We've gotten back to focusing on the basics. We are starting off right in the morning, getting the first flights of the day out on time. We are beginning the boarding process at the right time, so we can close the aircraft door and depart on schedule. We are continuing to invest in preventative maintenance, spare parts and ground-handling equipment to improve the reliability of our aircraft. We are enhancing the tools our co-workers use at the airport to make the check-in and predeparture processes easier for them and for our customers.","This quarter, we began the rollout of Aero [ph], our new easy-to-use interface for our passenger service system. Aero [ph] is an integrated front end for our airport and reservations agents, and Jim will speak about some of its benefits in a moment. Investing in modern, efficient and intuitive tools for our co-workers is core to United's technology strategy, and launching Aero [ph] is another step forward in our plan to improve the systems our airport and reservations agents use.","In addition to providing better tools to our co-workers, we're investing in customer-service training for all of our airport and reservations agents and flight attendants worldwide, including the flight attendants and airport agents at our United Express partners. To date, more than 14,000 of the 48,000 co-workers we will train have completed this interactive customer service training program. Feedback about the program has been excellent, and co-workers who participated in the training have found the material useful and directly applicable to their work. We expect to complete this important training by year-end.","We're already seeing positive results from our efforts. Customer satisfaction scores climbed in the first quarter, as customers experienced noticeable improvements in United's reliability, customer service and product offering. At the start of the year, we implemented a new customer satisfaction bonus program for our co-workers. Each quarter, we'll set a goal for customer satisfaction scores, and if we achieve that goal, our co-workers will earn a $50 bonus. I'm pleased to say that my co-workers achieved our customer satisfaction goal for the first quarter, and we look forward to delivering even better customer service for the remainder of the year. With the improvements in our operational processes and our investments in aircraft reliability and in the tools our co-workers use to do their jobs, we're confident our operational reliability and customer service will continue to improve and make United the best choice for customers.","During the first quarter, we reached tentative agreements for 3 joint collective bargaining agreements with the union representing 28,000 of our passenger service, fleet service and storekeeper co-workers. We were disappointed that the agreements were not ratified by those workgroups, and we'll be in discussions with the union and the National Mediation Board on a schedule to resume talks. Meanwhile, we're in discussions with the unions representing our technicians, our flight attendants and our dispatchers and hope to be in a position to reach one or more additional joint collective bargaining agreements later this year.","During 2013, our customers will experience even more of our product investments. Our onboard experience is now more consistent and comfortable, with over 7,000 flat-bed seats in our premium cabins and Economy Plus seating on almost every mainline aircraft. Today, we offer Wi-Fi with in-seat power on 51 aircraft, including global satellite-based Wi-Fi on 8 of our Boeing 747s, and we've installed larger overhead bins on 60% of our Airbus fleet.","We're in the process of completely revamping the interior of our p.s. aircraft, which fly between JFK and San Francisco and Los Angeles.  We're installing flat-bed seats, economy-plus seating, Wi-Fi and in-seat power throughout the aircraft, and initial feedback from our customers has been terrific. We're investing in new airplanes and took delivery of 6 new fuel-efficient Boeing 737-900ERs in the first quarter.","We're pleased that, late last week, the FAA gave the greenlight to Boeing to retrofit the battery system on our Dreamliners, and we currently expect to begin to fly them again domestically in May, with our first international 787 service being our new nonstop service between Denver and Narita on June 10. The grounding of the 787s disrupted our flight plans and had an impact on our bottom line, and we're eager to get this remarkable aircraft back up and flying.","We're also improving our customer's experience at our airports. We're rolling out a simplified and intuitive boarding process that's gone through extensive testing and will be in place at all of our hubs and many of our larger stations by the start of the busy summer travel seasons. The new simplified boarding process will reduce the congestion and stress at the gate and improve our ability to depart on time. Our customers are now enjoying the modern features, additional space and functionality of our newly-redesigned United Club in Chicago O'Hare's Terminal 2. We plan to completely renovate 3 more United Clubs this year. We recently unveiled the first phase of our new Terminal B at Houston intercontinental airport. The facility is customer-pleasing, with comfortable space, efficient gate layout and great concession options for our customers at our important gateway hub in Houston.","While we've been spending money on projects that drive returns, we need to do a better job of controlling our costs. We must become more efficient throughout our business in order to be globally competitive. With the distractions of our merger integration declining significantly and our operational performance and customer service improving, we're working to become more efficient and cost-effective while still maintaining solid operational performance, delivering great customer service and increasing our revenue. John will give a few examples of steps we're taking to reduce our costs, and Jim will talk about the actions we're taking to increase our revenue.","Some of the costs our industry faces are outside of our control. The U.S. airline industry is irrationally taxed. And together with our customers, airline pay nearly $19 billion annually in 17 different taxes and fees, excluding income tax. The federal government recently proposed a budget which would cost the U.S. airline industry an additional $5.5 billion per year in taxes and fees, which is more money than the amount of profit the entire industry earned in 2012.","In addition to heavy taxation, our government recently implemented broad-based furloughs for air traffic controllers, which have disrupted air travel across the nation. We are disappointed that the FAA chose this path that maximizes customer disruptions and damage to airlines instead of choosing a less disruptive method to comply with its budget obligations. Our top priority is to minimize the effect of the air traffic controller furloughs on our customers. Our professionals in our network operations center are working literally around the clock to minimize the impact of the FAA's irresponsible actions on our customers. And all of our co-workers are doing what they do best, safely managing our operations while delivering great customer service despite the government-imposed challenges we face.","This year, we're finally moving beyond our merger and our customers are seeing positive results from the hard work we've all put into building United. Consistently achieving our operational, customer satisfaction and financial goals will allow us to invest in our product and service for our customers and in tools and training for our co-workers, with the goal of providing appropriate returns for our investors. We are running United like a real business for long-term success.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim and John to go through the results in greater detail.","James E. Compton","Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to join Jeff in thanking my co-workers for all their efforts this quarter. We made significant progress on operational reliability and customer service this quarter, and we couldn't have done it without the hard work of the entire team. I also want to thank all of our customers for choosing United. We are working hard to win your business each and every day.","2013 got off to a strong start operationally, with the team achieving its best first quarter on-time performance in a decade despite significant storm activity. United averaged 81% in on-time performance in the first quarter, and we paid out $22 million to our co-workers for domestic and international on-time performance exceeding our monthly goal.","Our operational performance was particularly strong during the busy spring break travel period, which overlapped with the Easter holiday. During the last 3 weeks in March, load factors were 87.9%, nearly 2 points higher than the comparable period a year ago. Over this period, the United team worked together and achieved an 82.1% domestic on-time performance, an improvement of 4.5 points versus the same period in 2012. This was the first true test of our operations since last summer, with an extended period of high load factors and not only met our goal, we exceeded it.","One initiative that will support our operational performance is the new passenger service system interface called Aero [ph], which we rolled out to our gate agents in March. Aero [ph] is an integrated user interface which has intuitive and practical navigation to make the functions our agents perform easier and quicker. Hundreds of our front-line agents were involved in the design and development of Aero [ph], and it equips our co-workers with more accessible information and intuitive point-and-click access and also brings them added functionality. By June, gate agents will be able to perform all aspects of departure management within Aero [ph] at airports across the system. Later this year, we'll begin rolling out Aero [ph] to lobby agents, and then we'll roll it out to reservation agents beginning in early 2014.","Moving to capacity. Our first quarter consolidated capacity decreased 4.9% year-over-year. This was at the low end of the range we guided to in January, in large part due to higher-than-expected winter storm activity. Capacity discipline remains a key tenet of our strategy, and the trans-Atlantic region is a good example where we reduced capacity 10.2% year-over-year in the first quarter as we rightsized our footprint in response to the economic weakness we continue to see in Europe. One of the benefits of having a balanced global network with strength in each entity is that we're better able to respond to any change in economic conditions in a particular global region.","We expect second quarter consolidated capacity to decrease between 1.7% and 2.7% year-over-year and expect full year 2013 capacity to decline 0.75% to 1.75% versus 2012. Full year capacity guidance was lower than we guided to in January primarily due to the effect of the grounding of our 787 Dreamliners. We've made some schedule changes because of our inability to put the Dreamliners into service, and we expect to resume 787 domestic flying in May, with Denver to Tokyo, Narita scheduled to begin on June 10.","We expect to begin flying 787s from Los Angeles to Tokyo, Narita; Los Angeles to Shanghai; and Houston to Lagos in August and have delayed the launch of our San Francisco to Taipei route on a 777 from 2013 to 2014. These flights represent a substantial amount of ASMs. And while the delays lower our 2000 (sic) [ 2013 ] capacity outlook, they will increase our expected 2014 year-over-year capacity.","Turning to our revenue results. First quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue increased 5.9% year-over-year. A few items positively impacted first quarter PRASM results, including Easter shifting into March and overlapping with spring break this year and higher-than-expected weather-related cancellations, which lowered capacity. In 2012, we underperformed our peers by 1 to 2 PRASM points, and we're beginning to close that gap with our first quarter revenue results.","The depreciation of the yen reduced first quarter passenger revenue by approximately $20 million, and we expect the year-over-year yen pressure to continue throughout 2013. Despite the negative yen impact, the Pacific continued to perform quite well for us in the first quarter. Pacific PRASM increased 7.2% year-over-year due to both higher yields and loads. China was again a standout, with first quarter PRASM increasing 13% compared to the first quarter of 2012.","Corporate revenue began slowly recovering in the first quarter, increasing approximately 4% versus 2012. Despite the momentum we've seen with unit revenues since the start of the year, we are facing some headwinds. Certain economic indicators, including U.S. GDP outlook for the second and third quarters, have weakened since the start of the year. We have seen some impact on our April business mix, and we'll continue to monitor the outlook closely and make appropriate adjustments necessary. Also impacting business mix, government contract travel declined approximately 25% in the first quarter year-over-year, and we expect this trend to persist in the near term. Government contract travel, while an important piece of business for United, represents only about 2% of our overall passenger revenue.","Competition has increased in the transcon markets, and the associated pricing actions have stimulated demand on New York to San Francisco and Los Angeles routes. This month, a competitor introduced new service on Newark transcon routes and lowered fares by more than 20%, which will negatively impact our second quarter PRASM. With lower fares, demand between Newark and San Francisco and Los Angeles has increased, and we've shifted some capacity from other markets to this market to add frequencies and strengthen our position as the New York area's leading airline. These added frequencies supplement our existing service between these hubs, as well as our popular p.s. service between JFK and our hubs in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Like any other company, large or small, that faces a new competitor, we will make sure Newark transcon customers can find a seat at a competitive price on a United flight.","Part of our business plan at United is the continuous assessment of economic and demand trends. And as I mentioned, the latest macroeconomic outlook for the remainder of 2013 has softened. We'll continue to evaluate the demand environment as the year progresses, and we'll respond appropriately should conditions change.","Turning to our near-term revenue outlook. Yields have softened as a result of the factors I've just discussed, and we currently estimate United's April consolidated PRASM to be flat to down 1 point year-over-year. This PRASM estimate is preliminary based on the data we have for April thus far. Ancillary revenue continues to perform very well, with first quarter ancillary revenue up 13%, and ancillary revenue per passenger up 14% versus the same period in 2012. Our goal is to grow ancillary revenue per passenger by at least 9% in 2013, and our first quarter performance positions us well to achieve that target.","Improvements in Economy Plus and paid premium upgrades continue to drive much of the year-over-year growth in ancillary revenue. Sales of both Economy Plus and paid premium upgrades increased more than 40% year-over-year in the first quarter. A portion of the increase in preferred seating sales is due to more of our customers using direct channels for booking. The shift towards united.com and our mobile app allows our customers to take full advantage of our product and services that they value and comes at a lower cost to United than other distribution channels.","We relaunched our Premier Access product in the first quarter, which allows customers to enjoy the convenience of priority security and check-in lines, as well as priority boarding. Service charges related to ticketing and itinerary changes grew about 10% in the first quarter due in large part to our improved operational performance, which reduced the need to waive these service charges. This is an example of how running an on-time, reliable airline directly benefits the bottom line.","In addition to improving our network and ancillary product offering, we are upgrading United's product on the ground and in the air. We expect to open a new United Club in Seattle in the second quarter, with a similar modern look and feel as our new United Club at O'Hare's Terminal 2, offering comfortable space for our customers to work or relax.","We're investing in our onboard products as well, with Economy Plus on nearly all of our mainline aircraft and most of our larger regional aircraft and lie-flat seats on 182 aircraft. In addition, as Jeff mentioned, we have 51 aircraft with Wi-Fi today, 38 of which have global satellite-based Wi-Fi and 13 of which have ground-based Wi-Fi. With the world's best network, our modern fleet and leading product offering, a great team of co-workers and a significantly improved operational performance and customer service, we are well positioned to drive strong revenue results going forward. We're encouraged with the progress we've made this quarter, but we're not yet where we need to be.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John D. Rainey","Thanks, Jim. I'd like to start by thanking my co-workers for all of their hard work in the first quarter. By working together, we made significant progress in building the infrastructure we need to produce the level of returns our investors expect. Today, we reported a first quarter loss of $325 million. But during the quarter, we made significant investments in our operations, our fleet, our product offering and our people, and these investments are the right ones to make for the long term.","We have also significantly improved our balance sheet since the merger and made more progress this quarter by paying down high coupon debt, reducing the size of our term loan and doubling the size of our revolving credit facility. Our first quarter consolidated operating expenses increased 2.1%. We made a number of decisions to accelerate certain expenses into the first quarter, including preventive maintenance work as we prepared our operations for the summer peak.","First quarter consolidated CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit sharing, increased 11.1% versus 2012 in large part due to a 4.9% reduction in our consolidated capacity. Holding fuel rate and profit sharing constant, our first quarter consolidated unit cost increased 7.2% year-over-year. The increase in first quarter CASM, again, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit-sharing, is slightly below the guidance range we provided in our March investor update.","At the end of the quarter, we signed a contract extension with a maintenance provider that resulted in more favorable terms and muted some of the increase in first quarter maintenance expense. Our cost increase in the first quarter was higher than what's acceptable, and we are committed to becoming more efficient in every aspect of our business. The achievement of our long-term financial goals relies on providing the best product and service to our customers and doing it in a far more cost-effective manner than our first quarter results reflect.","As we previously announced, we are in the process of reducing management and administrative workforce by 6% and are about 2\/3 through that process. We now expect our full year capacity to decline further than we had anticipated due in part to the grounding of the 787, and we need to reduce our cost commensurate with that additional capacity decline. As our operations continue to improve and become even more stable, we will run them more efficiently, which will permit our people to focus even more on delivering great customer service every day.","Concurrently, we are investing in technology for our customers like our mobile app and tools for our co-workers like Aero [ph], the enhanced front end to our passenger service system, to make the airport experience easier and more efficient. Another example of our commitment to efficiency is fuel consumption. In addition to operating a fuel-efficient fleet, we have several operational initiatives underway to reduce fuel consumption. We are constantly looking for opportunities to improve in this area because even small improvements have a meaningful impact on the bottom line. For example, this quarter we became the launch customer for the new Split Scimitar Winglet, built by Aviation Partners Boeing, which will help us further reduce fuel burn on our Boeing 737 Next-Gen fleet by up to 1.8%.","For the second quarter, we expect CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit-sharing, to increase between 6.7% and 7.7% year-over-year. We expect full year CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expense and profit-sharing, to increase between 5.5% and 6.5% year-over-year on lower capacity. Our full year CASM guidance is higher than our original expectation at the start of the year because of a lower capacity outlook and the impact of accelerated depreciation from an agreement to sell aircraft to FedEx.","We reached an agreement during the first quarter to sell up to 30 Boeing 757-200 aircraft to FedEx and delivered the first aircraft to them this week. We had planned to retire these aircraft in the coming years, and this agreement will permit us to accelerate the elimination of older, less-efficient aircraft from our fleet. As a result of this agreement, we accelerated the depreciation of some of these aircraft, which will increase depreciation expense by approximately $80 million in 2013, $12 million of which was in the first quarter.","While the accelerated depreciation will adversely impact 2013 earnings, this agreement results in a positive economic outcome over the time period that these aircraft are replaced and provides a better product for our customers. It's another indication of how we are managing the business with a focus on creating long-term shareholder value. During the first quarter, we took delivery of 6 new Boeing 737-900ERs and retired 2 Boeing 757-200s and 3 Boeing 737-500s. In the second quarter, we expect to take delivery of 6 more new Boeing 737-900ERs and retire 12 mainline aircraft, including the last 5 Boeing 737-500s and 5 Boeing 767-200s.","We made substantial progress in strengthening our balance sheet in the first quarter, and our capital structure is the best that it's been in years. We made $1.3 billion of debt and capital lease payments in the first quarter, including $1 billion of prepayments. During the first quarter, we took 2 actions that significantly improved the health of our balance sheet: first, in February, we redeemed $600 million of secured notes with interest rates of 9 7\/8% on the first lien and 12% on the second lien; second, we replaced our $1.2 billion term loan that was due in February 2014 with a $900 million term loan due in 2019. The interest rate of this new financing is LIBOR plus 300 basis points, subject to a 1% LIBOR floor.","In conjunction with our term loan transaction, we replaced our $500 million revolving credit facility with a new $1 billion revolver. The combined term loan and revolver transaction improved our unrestricted liquidity position by $200 million and resulted in a more efficient source of liquidity. We closed the first quarter with an unrestricted liquidity position of $6.4 billion, including the new $1 billion dollar revolver.","In addition to our strong liquidity position, our unencumbered asset balance has been increasing as we pay off the related secured debt. We estimate our current unencumbered asset balance to be in excess of $4.5 billion. Improving our balance sheet is good for all of our stakeholders. It lowers our interest expense, allows us to focus on long-term investments that improve the experience for our customers and co-workers and makes us a better, less-risky investment for our shareholders.","As we look at our debt maturity profile over the next 5 years, we are confident in our ability to manage our annual debt service. We have approximately $1 billion of debt and capital lease maturities remaining in 2013, with approximately $500 million due in the second quarter. We have a 1.1 -- we have $1.1 billion of maturities due in 2014 and $1.9 billion due in 2015, which includes $800 million of 6 3\/4% secured notes, which become prepayable at par in September of 2014.","We expect approximately $530 million of gross and $340 million of net capital expenditures in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect gross capital expenditures of $2.5 billion, $1.7 billion net of financing. Our full year CapEx guidance is consistent with prior guidance from a cash flow perspective but reflect change in the way we account for the return of purchase deposits based upon how we finance aircraft.","While we reported a loss for the first quarter, our plan for 2013 remains the same, to generate a return on invested capital of at least 10%. We intend to recover the revenue we temporarily lost last year, strengthen our balance sheet and aggressively manage our costs. We are running this business to consistently create economic value for our shareholders and make United a great place to work and an even better airline to fly.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Thanks, John. None of us is happy with our first quarter financial results, but all of us believe that our operational and customer satisfaction results for the quarter offer proof that we're taking the right steps in building the foundation for our future.","We have high aspirations and the focus and determination to achieve them. Not only do we want to create the world's leading airline, but we want to create an airline that is actually a real business, a business that consistently invests in its product and customer service, a business that invests in tools and training for its co-workers, a business that competes and wins against its competitors and a business that consistently earns a sufficient return on its invested capital. We still have much work ahead of us before we can achieve these goals, but we're confident we're on the right path.","I'll now turn it over to Sarah to open up the call for questions.","Sarah Murphy","Thank you, Jeff. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Larissa, please describe the procedure to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Fintzen from Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question for Jim. You kind of walked through some of the moving parts of RASM in the quarter from comp to sort of weather and the like. I'm curious sort of on 2 pieces potentially. One of is, can you quantify what you think the weather -- I wouldn't want to say benefit, but the weather impact to RASM in 1Q was? And then is there anything you can disclose in terms of corporate share and sort of how much corporate share gain? Or do you think there's corporate share gain that's happening as you start to bring some of that business traffic that was on detour back on to the system?","James E. Compton","David, this is Jim. Weather-related capacity was down about 1%, and so we haven't assigned a RASM contribution to that. But clearly, that was one of the pieces of it. We've talked about the Easter shift, and we estimate that to be about 0.5 to 1 point of that RASM so that piece, we feel pretty comfortable with identifying. In terms of corporate, what I'd like to say is that what we're hearing from our corporations, first of all, and from our corporate travel managers is they're clearly recognizing the work the team has done in operations to bring back reliability. We're getting that feedback as we continue, as always, to have dialogues with them through the quarter. From a share perspective, though, I'd like -- we're seeing that recovery of the revenue that we lost last year. And so when you ask, where is that share gain, I'd say that share gain is positive versus where we're off last year, but we still feel we have a lot of work to do and to upside in terms of regaining what we lost last year. As well as by -- again, as I've talked to before, the dialogue with the corporations is not about the operational difficulties that we had last year. It's really about how we can bring value to their travel needs, and we think that has upside to us in the future also.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a quick one for John. Just you -- we have the CapEx guidance for this year. But just any sense how we should be thinking about CapEx kind of beyond this year?","John D. Rainey","Well, David, we talked about when we gave our CapEx guidance at the beginning of the year that there was a disproportionate amount of onetime items in this year. I think we said it was roughly half of our CapEx was more anomalous, sort of once-in-a-generation type items like building a data center or 2 new maintenance centers or maintenance hangars, like we are this year. Going forward, just sort of  from a run rate perspective, we're going to continue to focus on our fuel-efficient fleet. We've got 700 planes, and if we fly those planes 25 or 30 years, we're going to replace 25 to 30 a year. So from a fleet CapEx, that's what a normal run rate will be. That's going to be a little bit lumpy from one year to the next. I think the real area of improvement is in the non-aircraft CapEx, and I would expect that to come down appreciably. We still do have some CapEx needs related to this integration, I mean one of the things we're doing is sticking 2 airlines, putting 2 airlines together. So it's not going to just plummet next year, but we do hope to see that come down in the very near future.","Operator","John Godyn from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, I just wanted to follow up on some of your PRASM commentary there, just clarify 2 things. I think you just mentioned that you weren't quite at that sort of 2% run rate even though we've seen some of these months show very strong PRASM, like we did in March. That's not representative of yet being at that 2% sort of gap that you're looking to close. And secondarily, when we think about the nature of that 2% that you estimated for last year, I think not all months are created equal. As we look into this summer, isn't that gap -- I mean, is it fair to assume that, that gap that could be closed could be significantly more than 2% just because that period was particularly soft last year? Just curious what your thoughts are.","James E. Compton","John, I think it's a good point that you allude to. I think looking at RASM month-to-month basis, there's all kinds of things that can affect any individual month. So that when we talk about the 1 to 2 points last year, it's really a smoothing over the year of what we thought we lost, right? And so we talked about a year ago at this time, the first quarter with some items related to our cutting over to our revenue management system to a single optimizer, and we've talked about that, as well as some conservative booking around March 3 in PSS, that's attributing to about a 1-point RASM negative to us. And as you went through the year, I think different issues came up for the company. As you run into the second quarter and some of the stress that we put on our customers and our employees through the integration, the complication of the integration also affected our performance. And to your point, in the summer, particularly in July, our operational reliability hit its lowest level. So I think getting back to where I started, I think that we really feel that the 1 to 2 points in lost RASM points in the revenue associated with that was with a number of things last year, with the integration of the airline. And we feel comfortable we're on track in terms of regaining that, as first seen in our first quarter RASM performance. But still, we know we have a lot of work to do and really focused on getting all that back and again, building on the strength of the network.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And John, just one on cost. I know that this year is sort of a transition year with some CASM x fuel and inflation. But when we just sort of take step back and think about what a normalized CASM x fuel growth rate trend should be in a flattish capacity environment, how should we think about that?","John D. Rainey","John, probably 2\/3 of our CASM increase on a full year basis is related to the some of the mark-to-market on our new labor agreements, and that is clearly more one-time in nature. Going forward, you'll see more normal sort of standard yearly increases, and so I think this is clearly a blip for us. I think in a flat capacity environment, we ought to be trying to maintain our unit cost to something at an inflation level or below.","Operator","Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank is online with a question.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have a couple here. A couple of carriers around the world who fly the 787 have publicly indicated maybe what the impact was to them. I suspect that, that's not your style. Some of these are much more aggressive in going after the manufacturers for penalties. When we think about the March quarter, how much of an impact did the 787 grounding have? And I mean, you've already given us the capacity, a revised number which, for the year, it's a 75-basis-point hit. But is there anything else you can say about maybe additional costs incurred carrying a core of 787 pilots not being able to fly in some of these markets, maybe some revenue impact. Anything that you can give us on that front would be great.","John D. Rainey","Mike, this is John. In terms of the costs that we can specifically ascribe to the grounding of the 787, we took a special charge in the quarter, which included about $11 million related to the 787. Clearly, there's some other kind of revenue impact, if you will, which is much smaller and is not necessarily included in special charge. But we're excited to have the plane back and get it back flying next month. It is a great airplane. And Boeing has been a great partner with us, and we fully expect them to continue to be.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great, John. And then just my second question, and this is to Jim. We have the capacity plan, which is -- which has been revised lower. As we look at the business that you have tuned from Japan, you to do carry a fair share amount of Japanese leisure traffic. I know we are heading into the peak summer season. But is -- the bias, with respect to capacity, is it to the downside when we think about where the yen is, where the forecasts are for the yen later this year and as a result, what that will do to the demand from Japanese travelers to U.S. dollar-denominated destinations like Guam?","James E. Compton","Mike, Jim. The -- I think our capacity and guidance is right in line with kind of -- with where we expect the yen to be and the demand associated with it. The Japanese -- those packages, particularly the Guam, are baht- and yen-denominated, and so we think our capacity is lined fairly well in terms of the demand, in terms of the passenger traffic through there. But to your point, as always, when I make the macro assumption that we'll monitor the environment and so forth, we'll do that at a regional level also and make sure that we adjust capacity based on the demand that we're seeing.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Jim, just asking it another way. Is it -- does the fleet forward schedule actually already incorporate some drawdown in capacity in some of those markets?","James E. Compton","No, no. At this point, it's still our -- it's our plan that we've had for this year.","Operator","Hunter Keay from Wolfe Trahan is online with a question.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","John, correct me if I'm wrong, I may be looking at this table wrong, so please, first of all, tell me if I'm incorrect. But it looks like if Brent goes up by $40 per barrel, you're only saving $0.09 on your hedge book. And when I look at $110 million of hedge losses being run through the P&L, it just -- I think it begs some questions on sort of the strategy between keeping premium costs down and hedging against sort of these spikes that may be sort of exogenous-driven. So I guess the question here is, what is the hedging strategy? And when I see stuff like this, should I maybe think that it's open to changing?","John D. Rainey","First of all, Hunter, I'd say that we always look at what's going on in the oil market, and we are -- we take into account changes in the oil market with respect to our hedging strategy. What we've done, over the last year, probably is more what I would describe as hedging with a range bound mindset in terms of what happened to fuel. If you look at 2008, 2009, fuel ran up to $140 or whatever it was. Jet fuel, I think, was at the $170 level, and clearly, that created some demand distraction and you saw new sources of supply come on. And it appears now that the range that oil is trading in is much closer in. And so what we've done with our hedge book is reflect that, and so you see us taking these 3-way positions where we might buy a call at, say, for example, $110 Brent and then sell it at $125. And so we're protected in that range from $110 to $125. And so in your question, your example, yes if it goes to $140, we're not protected at that point. But I think what we've seen is that there's a certain amount of demand distraction that occurs at that point, and that's not something that can be sustained. And I think to insure for that is very expensive. Our hedge book today, we're about 34% hedged over the next 12 months, and we've spent $11 million or $12 million on the hedge premium. So I think it's a prudent use of our cash, considering that this is almost $13 billion of our cost structure, and it's something, I think, we're pretty thoughtful about. What you're seeing, in respect to the possible hedge loss, that's simply a mark-to-market swing from one month to the next, and we've seen prices come down appreciably here in the last week or so. And so as we mark-to-market that hedge position that doesn't get hedge accounting, that's going to swing the other way. We had a $50 million positive swing, a gain, this month and that could bounce back. But this is one way that we try to minimize and mute the volatility. As I said, fuel efficiency is another way. We spend a lot of capital and focus on that. And then lastly, I think we continue to believe that as an industry, we need to be able to price through our cost inputs. And that's one of the benefits, I think, that we've seen with some of the consolidation is a healthier, more structurally sound business.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, John. That's helpful. In terms of -- another question maybe for Jim or Jeff even. I'm a little surprised to hear you guys mention specifically the Newark, San Francisco route. Given that -- I kind of thought that it would be -- your network would be big enough to absorb sort of turf defenses like this without it showing up. And some of the pushback that I get a lot when I push a bull case for airlines is this whole concept of barriers to entry and airlines defending turf. With the realization that this is obviously a trunk route for you and it's of utmost strategic importance for the long term is clearly not helpful for your ROIC right now. And I guess, the question is how long are you willing to defend this turf? How willing do you think Virgin is to stay here and bleed losses for an extended period of time before something actually has to give?","James E. Compton","Hunter, Jim. So the way we think about the market is, obviously, it's -- when we've seen competitors come into a market and lower prices significantly, it generates a lot of demand. And it's unique to us because we have such a great presence in both the L.A. basin, the San Francisco Bay area, and we've talked about our great presence in New York. But prices that have been lowered as much as 20% -- starting at 20% down, when you have great presence in those markets is going to generate a lot of demand. And so the way we look at it is that we want to make sure that as we generate significant demand, that customers that want to fly United have a seat and they can get it. I will say that we don't -- we think about that in terms of also our kind of overall strategy right, our overall strategy of capacity discipline. And so as you can see, as we manage ourselves in that market, we haven't changed our guidance, our capacity, and we find ways to do it across the network that, quite frankly, every day what we're trying to do is optimize the network. and I think that's what our goal is and that's what we're trying to do, when someone stimulates that much demand is make sure that we have a seat for our passengers.","Operator","Glenn Engel from Bank of America is online with a question.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk about labor? There was a flight attendant agreement that didn't end up happening. Do you end up keeping that in your accruals anyhow even though the agreement was rejected? And where are we in terms of which groups have had their wages harmonized, which still have left? And where are we on integrating contracts?","John D. Rainey","Glenn, this is John. The agreement that there was a TA for, tentative agreement, that did not ratify was for the employees that are represented by the IAM, which is our customer contact and airport agents. That did not ratify, to your point. We're still's optimistic that we will get a deal there. I think that any time that there's -- something like that is voted down, we want to take into account the reasons why it was voted down and see if we can reshuffle the deck chairs and get something that is good for our employees and good for the company. So to the -- we still are optimistic about that and there is still some amount of costs in our guidance for the full year for that. With respect to...","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is that not reflected in the first quarter as well?","John D. Rainey","It was reflected in the first quarter because we had an expectation that it would ratify. That's one of the reasons our cost guidance came in slightly better than what we expected when it didn't.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the rest?","John D. Rainey","Yes, with respect to the other labor groups, obviously, we got -- made a significant achievement with our pilots in getting a JCBA there. We still need to get -- while we've had individual labor agreements with each of the 2 sides, on the flight attendant side as well as the mechanics side, we are working through the joint collective bargaining process there. I don't really -- I can't really give you an idea in terms of timing, but it's something that we clearly recognize our employees want and we want. I think all being part of one team and being under -- all rolling together is an important aspect of getting these 2 groups together.","Operator","Jamie Baker from JP Morgan is online with a question.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question relates to H7N9. It doesn't appear that the virus has driven any revisions in your schedules or your business plan. But in the event we have a repeat of SARS, could you remind us as to what your network options are? What level of capacity can you pull down before you start jeopardizing slot and route rights? Would capacity more likely be grounded? Or should we assume it's redeployed? Just what's -- wondering what sort of network contingency you might be thinking about.","James E. Compton","Jamie, this is Jim. Similar to H1N1 years ago, we actually have good flexibility in order to adjust our capacity. To this point, as you mentioned, the current flu, we're not seeing any significant booking away or any significant impact due to it. We, obviously, watch and monitor the CDC very closely and work with the field and so forth. But based on past experience, we've had tremendous flexibility to adjust, and I think, obviously, with the breadth of the network now, the flexibility is more enhanced in today's environment than even years ago.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, that's a good point. It was a pre-merger phenomenon. Second question for Jeff, if air travel didn't take so long, I'd do more of it, and I'd be willing to pay more for it. The most recent and best example of an initiative that actually improves the value proposition of air travel is PreCheck, and that's not even an airline idea. It's a government program. It isn't perfect, but it does make things faster. And I would argue that, that's the -- speed is the business that you're in. So programs like global services, concierge key, very lavish benefits. They make the time allocated to air travel more pleasant, but they don't decrease the time that it takes. So here's my question, do you think there's an opportunity for an airline to ever come up with a program that actually improves on the amount of time travel takes? Or do we have to rely on the government to take this out for us?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Well, there's a couple of things, Jamie. First of all, as you probably know, we've -- since 9\/11, we've been working with the government to have a more logical and layered approach to security, and you recollect the old \"trusted traveler\" idea. Well, precheck is essentially that, finally. It's taken the government a long time. As you know, we do not control the TSA and we -- all we can do is talk to them and plead with them. But I must say I commend the TSA for coming up finally with PreCheck. It's an excellent product, and I would encourage every traveler who qualifies for it to do because it's superb. It's like the good old days, and it does indeed save time. We do offer Premier Line and Premier Access to our customers, which speeds them through, our Premier Lines, through security and also boarding at the gate. So we are very conscious of our customers' time. We do -- that's why we also do our very best to run a reliable operation to minimize the delays and to get people where they want to go on time.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We'll now take calls from the media.","[Operator Instructions] Mary Jane Credeur from Bloomberg News is online with a question.","Mary Jane Credeur","[indiscernible] situation. And can you quantify how many flights you're seeing delayed on any given day, what it looks like at peak time versus nonpeak? And what's going to happen when we get a big nasty thunderstorm on a Monday morning?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Mary Jane, I'm sorry, you faded out. But I assume you're talking about the air traffic control furloughs?","Mary Jane Credeur","Yes, sir.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Yes, sure. Right now, let me -- first of all, let me tell you that I think everyone knows that this is very frustrating for everyone, for our customers, for our co-workers, and we're doing our best to help our customers. As I mentioned earlier, we've got great folks not only at our network operation but our airports, working to minimize the impacts on the customers. And so far, we've been able to limit the flight cancellations to our regional operations, not the mainline. That's affects fewer passengers because the regionals carry fewer passengers than the mainline. But the delays are indeed affecting our mainline operations. At United, we -- this is so far affecting, on average, about 20,000 passengers a day, and of course, all of our competitors are experiencing similar effects because this is a network business. We're working with A4A, Airlines for America, which is our industry association in D.C. And this is clearly a network business, and the cancellations and delays will be cumulative. The longer this goes on for us and for all of our competitors and for all of the customers nationwide, it's going to have -- if it continues on, it will have an average effect on the industry and the economy as well. And at both of those, there's got to be a better way. Look, there are very good folks in Washington who understand what's happening and they want to fix it, and we're working with them in every way we can. But one thing I just want to make clear to you is that this isn't the fault of the air traffic controllers. I mean, they're doing their very best to manage flights under really difficult circumstances, and I want them to know that we support them. And we appreciate all they're doing to minimize the impact of the furloughs.","Mary Jane Credeur","And do you think that we'll have -- there's talk just this last day or so of a legislative solution possibly percolating. Do you think that, that will come to fruition?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Well, we're certainly hopeful that -- well, we're certainly working with the good folks in Washington to make that happen. I mean, this is really important for our nation. This is something that, if it continues, it will damage our economy, it will damage jobs. This cannot continue, and I hope the good folks in Washington that we're working with will get that legislation drafted and passed and on the President's desk.","Operator","Josh Freed from the Associated Press is online with a question.","Josh Freed","Further on the air traffic control situation, do you get any kind of heads up or guidance from FAA on where they should be? I mean to what extent are you able to plan ahead? I mean, do you get 6 hours' notice, 24 hours' notice on furloughs? Maybe you can tell us a little more about that.","Jeffery A. Smisek","Well, we obviously are in contact within as much as we can be, and we have morning calls with them. But these are a bit like sort of pop-up thunderstorms, they are not predictable. The problem is there's no consistency to it, and it's very hard to plan for, Josh. The result of that is you can't effectively pull down schedules like you could in a storm system, where you can see it coming and then you can take action ahead of time. This is -- this pops up around the country fairly randomly, and that's what makes it so difficult and that's what makes it candidly so much harder on our customers.","Josh Freed","All right. And do you think it will continue that you'll be able to prevent cancellations on the mainline? Or is it doubtful that, that will -- do you think eventually this will start to hit the mainline more?","Jeffery A. Smisek","Josh, I don't know. It just depends upon how this falls out. I think we'll be a lot smarter over time. I hope that we don't have to be smarter over time. I hope that our -- the folks in Washington will realize how severe this is. I believe they are realizing it and will take action to stop it.","Sarah Murphy","Okay. With that, we're out of time, so we'll conclude. Thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today. Please call media relations if you have further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
