Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","Jim Bombassei","Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the time to join us for our December quarter earnings call. Joining me for today\u2019s discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC.","Today\u2019s remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliation for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bakish","Thanks, Jim, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. It\u2019s early days in our effort to chart a new course for Viacom, but I\u2019m happy to say, we made solid initial progress financially and operationally in the first quarter, and we made excellent progress on our go forward strategy.","Financially, we generated good momentum in the quarter including a return to revenue growth in our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. An increase in affiliate revenue and strength in our international operations drove top line growth in our Media Networks, while a stronger slate at Paramount drove greater returns at the box office. Of course, we still have work to do. Operating income declined in the quarter due largely to increased programming expenses at the networks and marketing costs at Paramount.","Operationally, we\u2019ve quickly made strides against our most-immediate priorities in my first two months on the job. First, and broadly speaking, we\u2019ve done a lot of work strengthening the management team. With important new leadership announcements across Paramount Pictures, our domestic networks Viacom International Media Networks and U.S. distribution. Second and speaking of U.S. distribution, beginning the work of strengthening our distribution partnerships has been a key area of focus. I\u2019ve been spending time with a number of these clients and the team under new leadership is already at work pursuing broader, more forward thinking partnerships that reinforce the value of the pay TV ecosystem and our brands, and the take advantage of some assets that previously were not part of the equation.","Third, MTV has been a key focus where already our new leadership is making progress. The new team is working quickly to stabilize the grid and provide a stronger foundation from which to launch new series as it continues to jump start the development pipeline. Fourth, over Paramount, our new COO is now in the lot and we completed an important agreement with Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media, giving Paramount two new strategic partners in China and a deal that we estimate could bring as much as $1 billion of slate funding to the studio. On a related note, I would like to extend a well-deserved word of congratulations to the studio for receiving 18 Oscar nominations for seven of its 2016 releases.","That said, the financial performance of the studio in that quarter was a significant disappointment. But nevertheless, we will continue to be very focused on strengthening Paramount, particularly as we evolve our strategy; more on that in a bit. Finally, we rapidly unlocked value from our Telefe acquisition, boosting rating significantly with the new Nick Jr. block, driving MTV up in the rankings with a hit new series that airs daily across MTV and Telefe, and bringing a major new consumer product to advertiser to our pay networks.","As we strengthened our team and attacked our media priorities, I also engaged dozens of our top leaders around the Company to develop an overall go forward strategy for Viacom, a strategy that captures the opportunities we see to better harness the power of our portfolio, strengthen our relationships with our partners, and enhance our ability to create great content, and one that will strengthen the Company overall and return us to growth.","We presented to and received resounding support from the Viacom Board on that strategy earlier this week, and I want to share with you the highlights today. But before I do, let\u2019s turn it over to Wade for a look at the financials.","Wade Davis","Thanks Bob, and good morning. We\u2019re pleased to report our financial results for the December quarter of fiscal 2017 which are highlighted by our progress along certain key operating metrics and initiatives. In the quarter, we returned to revenue growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment and we saw significant improvement in free cash flow generation. We also took steps to extend our near-term maturities to enhance our liquidity profile, and we entered into a multiyear slate financing deal which helps derisk Paramount\u2019s current and future slate and reduce the capital we deploy in the film business.","In addition, on slide five of our earnings presentation, we have provided a breakdown of Media Networks domestic versus international revenue. So, we hope you find the additional disclosure helpful. With that, I\u2019ll turn to our operating results.","In terms of consolidated results, Viacom generated revenue of $3.3 billion, a 5% increase over the prior year, and adjusted operating income of $748 million. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.04. Our return to top line growth was driven by growth in domestic affiliate revenues, continued strength at our international operations, and robust theatrical revenues. We also generated operating free cash flow of $113 million in the quarter, an improvement of $265 million versus the prior year.","Slide four of our web deck provides a financial overview of our Media Networks segment. Revenues for the quarter increased by 1% to $2.6 billion while adjusted operating income declined to $987 million. Worldwide advertising revenues declined 2% while affiliate revenues increased 2% and ancillary revenues increased 20%. Excluding a two-percentage-point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and a one-percentage-point positive impact from the November acquisition of Telefe, worldwide revenues increased 2%.","Slide five of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks\u2019 domestic and international revenue performance. Domestic revenues largely flat at $2.1 billion, and we had another strong quarter at our international operations as revenues increased by 5% to $534 million. On an organic basis, if we exclude a 13-percentage-point unfavorable foreign currency impact and eight-percentage-point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenue grew 10%.","At our domestic Media Networks business, we saw return to growth in affiliate revenues as well as strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth of 2% in domestic affiliate revenues reflects rate increases and the impact of SVOD and OTT agreements, partially offset by a modest decline in pay TV subscribers. The 10% increase in domestic ancillary revenues was driven by higher home video revenue.","Domestic advertising declined 3% in the quarter, consistent with our guidance of 500 basis-point sequential improvement. International advertising revenues increased 1% in the quarter. Organically, if we exclude a 15-percentage-point unfavorable impact from foreign currency and a 10-percentage-point positive impact from the acquisition of Telefe, international advertising revenues grew 6%, reflecting the continued strength in Europe.","International affiliate revenues increased 3%. Excluding a 9-percentage-point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international affiliate revenues increased 12%. The growth reflects the impact of rate increases, subscriber growth, and new channel launches as well as higher revenues from SVOD and OTT arrangements.","International ancillary revenues were up 33% due primarily to strong growth in our international consumer products business as well as program sales resulting from our acquisition of Telefe. Growth in consumer products was driven by the strength of our kids\u2019 brands, including Paw Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines.","Worldwide expenses increased 6% in the quarter; within operating expenses, programming expenses up 6% while distribution and other expense decreased 3%. SG&A expense increased 9% in the quarter. Excluding a 2-percentage-point increase attributable to Telefe, worldwide expenses increased 4%. The increase in programming expense in the quarter was principally driven by our investment in original programming. The increase in SG&A costs was principally due to the higher incentive compensation accrual.","Overall, we are pleased with the progress we\u2019re making at Media Networks. With the changes we\u2019ve made so far as well as the strategy for the brands that Bob will outline, we believe that our Media Networks are well-positioned for future growth.","Now, turning to Paramount. As I mentioned earlier, we have taken steps to derisk the 2017 slate and enhance cash flow through our slate financing. It is a three-year agreement with an option for a fourth with Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media to fund 25% of our slate. This agreement will help us to derisk the entire 2017 slate since it\u2019s retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year. The agreement also provides for the potential co-production of Chinese films.","Now, turning to our results for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment revenues increased 24%, principally driven by gains in theatrical and ancillary revenues. Slide six of the earnings presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues increased 104% or $192 million due to our current quarter releases, including Jack Reacher: Never Go Back; Ally, Arrival, Office Christmas Party and Fences. Ancillary revenues increased 86% to $78 million, driven by the impact of the film slate financing in the quarter. ","Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating of loss of $180 million in the quarter, reflecting higher print and advertising costs related to the release of our Q1 fiscal 2017 theatrical releases.","Now turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% compared to 32.8% in the prior year. This is driven by the mix of domestic and international income. Slide 10 of the earnings presentation provides the components of free cash flow. For the quarter, we generated $113 million of operating free cash flow, a $265 million improvement versus the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower working capital utilization, reflecting the timing of film and programming spend.","Now, looking at our debt on slide nine. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.5%. We had $12.3 billion of total debt and $443 million cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.1 times.","During the quarter, we took several steps to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. In October, we issued $400 million of 2.25% senior notes due 2022 and $900 million of 3.45% senior notes due 2026. The proceeds were used to redeem $400 million outstanding of our 2.5% December 2016 notes and the $500 million outstanding of our 3.5% April 2017 notes. One of our top priorities is to strengthen our balance sheet and optimize our capital structure to support our long-term strategic initiatives. Accordingly, in terms of capital allocation, we plan to use our excess free cash flow and other actions to delever in order to preserve our investment grade rating.","Now, let\u2019s turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2017. In terms of advertising, we continue to see strong demand in the scatter market, which bodes well for the upfront. Looking forward, we expect the shift of the Easter holiday into the June quarter of this year will have a negative impact of around 100 basis points on the March quarter domestic ad sales performance. Excluding this impact, we anticipate March quarter domestic ad sales performance would be similar to December quarter.","As for domestic affiliate revenues, in terms of March quarter, we expect to see revenue growth in the low single digits. For the full year, we continue to expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the mid to high single digits including factoring in the impact of the acquisition of Telefe.","For the full year, Media Networks SG&A expense, we expect the organic growth rate will be in the mid single digits. However, including the acquisition of Telefe, reported SG&A expense will grow in the high single digits primarily due to onetime integration costs. Media Networks performance in the December quarter benefitted from the growth in revenues as well as the timing of expenses as certain show launches moved out of the quarter. Accordingly, given the timing of shows coming on air as well as the onetime cost associated with the integration of Telefe, we anticipate programming and SG&A expense growth to be weighted to the March quarter.","At Filmed Entertainment, our December quarter benefitted from slate financing and the box office performance of certain of our releases. In the March quarter-to-date, some of the box office performance has been somewhat soft; so the benefits we saw in the December quarter will not flow through for the year.","In terms of taxes, for 2017, we\u2019re forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 31%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.","Looking forward, we are excited to execute on the strategic plan that Bob will be outlining for you. Changes at Media Networks are already starting to generate early returns. We are focused on returning key revenue streams to growth, improving our earnings, and driving free cash flow generation. We expect to continue to see improvement as we execute on our strategic plan.","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Bob.","Bob Bakish","Thanks, Wade. Now, let\u2019s get into the strategy. Having undertaking a comprehensive review of our business, we arrived at four underlying needs for Viacom. We need more focus. We have to align the Company against areas where we can have the greatest impact. We need to be distinct. Our brands, content and culture must truly be unique and differentiated. We need to unlock the benefits of our scale. We need to better harness the power of our portfolio and grow our competitive strength. And finally, we need to be more adaptable. We need to flex the market shifts, create new opportunities, and strengthen partnerships.","With these in mind, we\u2019ve established a new five-point strategic plan. We will, one, put the full power of Viacom behind six flagship brands; two, revitalize and elevate our approach to content and talent development; three deepen partnerships to drive traditional revenue streams; four, make big moves in the digital world and the physical world; and five, continue to optimize and energize our organization.","First, let\u2019s talk about flagship brands: A strategic shift we are making to better allocate resources and capture broader opportunities for our brands with the biggest upside. So, what constitutes a flagship brand? A flagship brand must have a compelling, valuable and distinct brand promise; it must resonate with the target audience or in a genre that is big enough to matter; it must have a rich offering comprised largely of wholly-owned content; it must be global; and it must have the ability to deliver at for points of distribution, linear television, digital, off channel, and theatrical. So, here are the flagship six: Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., MTV, BET, Comedy Central and Paramount. I am excited to say, we will bring a set of our TV brands to film and our film brand to TV in a major way.","With regards to the first part, TV brands to film. We plan for each of our flagship brands to contribute 1 to 2 cobranded films to the Paramount slate each year with the brand and the studio working collaboratively to source and develop projects for the studio to ultimately green light. As we do all this, note that a significant part of the slate will remain under the Paramount brand with the focus on franchises and tentpoles among other projects.","Let\u2019s look at this approach through the lens of Nickelodeon, a case study of what a flagship brand looks like when firing on all cylinders. The network has firmly established its dominance on TV with kids, finishing the 2016 calendar year as a number one network for kids and basic cable\u2019s top entertainment network. Nick was number one in the December quarter with every major kids demo, 2 to 11, 2 to 5, and 6 to 11 where it notched its first win in more than five years, and it shows no signs of slowing down, with the content pipeline of more than 650 episodes a year, almost entirely wholly-owned, highly exportable content across live action, animation and pre-school. All of that IP sees a multi-billion dollar consumer products business at retail and a growing stable of live tours and events. And as part of our new strategy, I am pleased to announce that Nickelodeon and Paramount are moving forward on a new slate of four films through 2020 that will leverage existing and introduce new Nickelodeon IP.","The first of these films, Amusement Park, an animated feature with Jennifer Garner and Mila Kunis will premier in theatres in summer of 2018 and it will get a TV series on Nick, the following year. And there are additional films including those associated with existing Nickelodeon franchises right behind it.","So, the strategy is not just an idea, we are already moving on it, and know that we are currently putting a structure in place to operationalize this approach across our flagship brands and the studio.","I am also excited to announce that we will be bringing the Paramount brand to TV in a big way by rebranding our U.S. Spike Network in 2018 as the Paramount Network. Adopting the Paramount name and fortifying its programming is a natural way for Spike to strengthen its position as a major general entertainment network which will enhance our adult audience delivery and enable us to grow this important sector of the ad market.","Internationally, we\u2019ve been very successful in capitalizing on the marquee Paramount brand to offer general entertainment channels that feature high-quality programming, movies and documentaries. In fact, the Paramount channel is already the largest ad supported movie channel in the world.","Now, I want to be clear that Viacom has some very important and high-performing brands beyond the flagship six, branded networks that hold strong positions in their categories and maintaining diverse and loyal followings. They will not go away, but they don\u2019t necessarily have global or theatrical potential, and they won\u2019t benefit from an increased resource commitment. We see these as reinforcing brands. And VH1, Logo, TV Land, and CMT have already been realigned within our organization to reinforce the flagship six.","Moving to our next strategic point, maximizing our approach to content and talent development. Historically, Viacom\u2019s brands were set up and operated in a very distributed siloed manner. In the past decade, we\u2019ve inched towards a more holistic approach, but have never fully committed to it in the way we must to be successful in this environment. So, we are going to change that, beginning by prioritizing investment to the flagship six, then sharpening creative filters and program and to make sure the brands remain distinct and complementary, accelerating global opportunities and implementing a more holistic approach to scheduling, marketing and digital. As we do that, we will increase the volume of originals and push more aggressively into new format and life. And we want to share ideas more aggressively across borders for our flagship brands. Nickelodeon is already very established in this model, and MTV is moving quickly with MTV U.S. now developing several MTV U.K. formats.","We also need to transform the way we work with talent. We need to do a much better job of keeping our homegrown talent in the Viacom ecosystem, creating new opportunities for our starts across networks and at Paramount with our new branded film slates. Comedy Central is launching 10 new series this year, more than it ever has, representing the biggest influx of new talent to the brand since it introduced the likes of Amy Schumer and Key & Peele.","We are acutely focused on providing divorce opportunities for this talent to create and grow their careers under our roof. Trevor Noah is a great example. The daily show lapped the year on a ratings high with its most watched and highest rated quarter ever for Trevor among total viewers and adults 18 to 49. We are collaborating across our portfolio to drive greater growth to Trevor, harnessing greater support from our domestic networks and localizing the format internationally.","Our third strategic area of focus is deepening partnerships to drive traditional revenue streams. To drive the scale, strength and flexibility we need, we need to emphasize partnership more than this Company ever has. With the traditional MVPDs, we are focused on cultivating true strategic partnerships that reposition our brands and push the industry forward, rather than the transactional relationships restricted to zero sum economic negotiation. To that end, we are focused on leveraging our data, products, ad sales, and marketing expertise to help grow their businesses. We will also reinforce the pay TV ecosystem by being highly selective in striking agreements with over the top distributors, confining those deals to largely library content. We do want to support the success of virtual MVPDs, as we have with partners like Sling and DIRECTV Now, and embrace their roles as catalyst for innovation.","In ad sales, we\u2019ll build up our leadership in data-driven products and branded entertainment, but we will also create more value through tighter alignment across the portfolio. For instance, we are heading into the upfront with the most comprehensive cross-portfolio package Viacom has ever offered, a product we call Epic. It spans 9 networks, 20 tentpoles and 60 returning series.","Moving on to the fourth point, we are going to make big moves in the digital and the physical world. In digital, short-form video has clearly emerged as a dominant medium. And because it is video, it is an area where we have inherent strength and capabilities. But like another areas, our lack of a holistic unified approach to short-form content development and distribution, has held up back. To fix this, we are creating a new business unit focused on producing short-form content, both original IP and leveraging our brands. We will aggressively grow short-form output at our flagship brands for distribution by both our owned and operated, as well as third party platforms. This will allow Viacom to better serve increasing demand from our advertisers for this kind of inventory and better support our brands.","We also want to create more and stronger expressions of our brands in the physical world. This is a necessary and valuable tool for marketing, talent development and extending our consumer connections, and it is an incremental business. Take MTV outside the U.S. for example. Last year, over 1 million people went to an MTV event. That\u2019s great for the brand, and we made money doing it, and we\u2019re working to expand and grow this business.","Comedy Central in the U.S., for example, will enter the festival space this summer in partnership with Superfly, the company behind Bonnaroo. This is a big opportunity for Comedy Central to grow its standing as a dominant comedy brand in the U.S., and it creates greater opportunities for Comedy Central\u2019s roster of emerging standup comedians, many of whom moved into our development pipeline with new series.","We also think there is a big opportunity to grow Bellator. And rebranding Spike to the Paramount Network will help us capitalize on that. Taken together, we believe these digital and physical opportunities represent important incremental revenue streams, and they reinforce our brand and IP.","And fifth and finally, we are continuing to optimize and energize our organization. We are rethinking our operations to allow for better collaboration across our portfolio as well as more holistic relationships with our partners. And as we do this, we have the opportunity to realign the organization to build future growth.","We are also very-focused on culture, and establishing a shared vision and values that elevate the very best of what Viacom has offered in its proud successful history. It\u2019s a history that I am confident we will build on. By staying focused as a portfolio but flexible in our approach to the market, we will build scale, be even more competitive, and evolve Viacom into the premier portfolio of global multi-platform entertainment brands.","As we do, we\u2019ll be focused on driving growth and earnings and free cash flow as key metrics of our progress, and on delivering value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support.","And with that, let me turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. Bob, you covered a lot of ground. I probably have 20 or 30 questions. So, why don\u2019t I just start with one high level and leave it to others. What do you see as the biggest execution hurdles in this revitalization strategy laid out?","Bob Bakish","Thanks, Doug. I think the reality is we now have a clear path forward, which we as a management team, are absolutely convinced will create value and competitive advantage for the Company. That said, there are a lot of pieces we have to execute on. And whether that\u2019s putting in place a new structure at Paramount to enable the expansion or really the development of the brand, the film slate, whether that\u2019s moving quickly with the Paramount Network rebrands, whether that\u2019s implementing a new approach in terms of our distribution strategy and relationships, it really does come down to a set of execution. But, I believe we have the team in place; and obviously, we\u2019ll continue to look to supplement that team to get the work done. And again, it is an executable plan, and it is -- we are not focused on creating some new unknown thing. We just need to execute, and I\u2019m confident we can do it.","Doug Mitchelson","If I can just follow up with how long do you think before you believe the Company will really hit to stride over this plan?","Bob Bakish","What I\u2019ve been focused on since day one is forward movement in the Company, and that will absolutely remain a focus. Now some things can happen relatively quickly, some things take a little more time. For example, a film from the day it\u2019s conceived to the day it releases, you look at it like 2, 2.5 years. So that does take some time. Thankfully, we have some Nickelodeon products already in the pipeline that we could all get behind and move on. Other things will happen more quickly. I continue to be pleased with the MTV U.S. journey for example. And if you look at what\u2019s going on there, clearly, we\u2019ll be talking about a whole new slate in the upfront; that we\u2019ll be launching in the fourth fiscal quarter. So, that is a much more nearer term opportunity. But again, overall, you can think of that as a steady march towards a revitalized Viacom, and you will see continued progress.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you, very interesting.","Wade Davis","From a financial perspective, you can expect to see strong growth in the second half of the year. So, a lot of things that Bob\u2019s talked about strategies that are underway, you\u2019ll start to see reflected in the -- or you will continue to see reflected in the financial performance.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Thank you. Bob, can you talk a little bit more about the rebrand to the Paramount, I guess network. How much of an incremental investment should we expect, and what kind of window does it provide to attract new advertisers or categories? And then, I guess more broadly, as you know, domestic Media Networks have an under margin pressure. Based on the new strategy, can you talk maybe more about the path forward in terms of margin improvement?","Bob Bakish","Sure. So, let me start by saying that the strategy overall from a financial standpoint on the cost base is about prioritization and remix. So, on a total Company basis or total Media Networks basis, we are not talking about a significant increase in aggregate spending. Now, going to the Paramount Network in particular, Paramount Network will benefit from an increased commitment of resources within Media Networks. That will enable a couple of things. One, but fundamentally, will enable a stronger program in slate including original production. However, I want to note that one of the inherent appeals of this strategy is one of benefitting from scale. In other words, scripted programming will be a significant part of the Paramount Network slate as it comes to life in 2018. It will benefit from a concentration of some of the scripted stuff we\u2019ve been doing on across the house. So, that\u2019s one of the things you will see.","Spike, soon to be rebranded the Paramount Network, already has a significant amount of film product on it, and we already as Viacom, have a significant amount of Paramount product under license, but we\u2019re going to be moving some stuff around. So that -- and the last thing I would say about the Paramount Network is, today what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re announcing our going forward strategy. We\u2019re actually -- we communicated to the Board on Monday, I am communicating it via Facebook Live to all employees later today. So, there is a small group of people that are aware of the Paramount Network strategy but really starting today is when we do the detailed work on bringing that what I believe, great general entertainment network to life. And so, there will be -- we will be building that plan; you\u2019ll be learning more; we\u2019ll be talking about it in the marketplace and obviously driving towards a rebrand as we said, in 2018, early 2018.","As for the broader Media Networks, the other part of your question, again, the strategy is about emphasizing these flagship brands where we believe there is incremental opportunity, not only within their traditional media network space but beyond that will benefit the P&L. And we will shift some resources around from the reinforcing networks. But in aggregate, again, there won\u2019t be an increase in spending.","I don\u2019t know, Wade, if you want to add anything?","Wade Davis","Yes. I think the question about margin expansion and when we\u2019ll begin to see that. We\u2019re going to be continuing to invest in effecting the strategy that Bob described. In particular, there are going to be programming investments and shifts into Q3 and Q4. So, we had set those investments to start paying off, and you\u2019ll start to see margin expansion in the fourth quarter.","Bob Bakish","And just sorry, the other thing you did ask about was the ad category impact, if you will, relationship with Paramount Network. If you look at Spike, it has a, I\u2019ll call it, a GE type ad base. So, it has relationships and spending from a range of clients. However, because the Paramount Network will up our general entertainment gain including ultimately deliver larger audiences, it\u2019s a key path forward for expanding our share of the adult market. And we believe that\u2019s an important growth driver for Media Networks and therefore Viacom.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi. Thank you, and thanks Bob for all that color, and congratulations; nice to see such a positive turn in results here. Just sort of following up on your comments on the flagship six brands and the rebranding of Spike, have you discussed sort of this new strategy with the distributors? I think you just said you\u2019re sort of early days in this announcement, but I wanted to know if that\u2019s something you guys do ahead of time or is that just something you address when the renewals come up for at a later date? And then I have a follow-up.","Bob Bakish","Sure. Alexia, the answer is yes. We started conversations with our distributors early this week. In fact, I had a conversation with a CEO of one of the largest MVPDs, last Friday, and I talked about this strategic move. It\u2019s important to note that from a contractual standpoint, there are no issues with this. It is a rebrand of Spike, the definition of Spike includes movies and the likes. There is no contractual problems, but we wanted to talk -- we wanted our key clients to hear from us first, and that\u2019s what we did. We also by the way had conversations with many agencies and some key advertising accounts over the last two days, and we have gotten very positive feedback on this strategic move.","Alexia Quadrani","And then, just a follow-up on the affiliate growth, I think you highlighted SVOD and OTT helping drive the domestic affiliate growth, I think maybe total. Can you elaborate, I guess on how significant those deals are? And in general, what is your strategy you\u2019re thinking going forward about further SVOD deals?","Wade Davis","So, from an overall affiliate standpoint, we expect low to mid single digit growth for the full year. We also expect the growth rate to -- again, consistent with some of the other trends in the business, see a slight compression from where we are in the first quarter and then really an acceleration in the second half of the year that will land us in that kind of low to mid single digit range. SVOD is not going to be a significant part of our affiliate revenue, as it has been in the past. And so, again, we feel very confident in that level of growth and those dynamics.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. Bob, have you had a chance, and maybe if not, how are you thinking about new virtual and MVPDs and your new network strategy? And I guess what I\u2019m thinking is, does it -- are you considering the idea and is it an opportunity to sort of bring six core networks to new streaming platforms in a way that you -- this changes relationship with your distribution partners and creates maybe a better opportunity for Viacom to participate in some of those platforms and at least I think the consensus, as you -- Viacom is not participating? Just curious how the rebrand may affect you thinking on new platforms, as you move forward, if it\u2019s significant?","Bob Bakish","Yes. I think it\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019ve thought about a lot in terms of the context for developing the strategy. And I think the point is actually bigger than what you suggest, which is if you think about the impact of OTT on the market, on an international basis, you can argue that given current pay TV penetration levels, OTT should be a positive catalyst for growth in penetration and reach. In the U.S., it\u2019s hard to make that argument. In fact, the more likely outcome and one outcome that I think is increasingly talked about is, it\u2019s a negative impact on price at different tiers of opportunities come to market for consumers. As that happens, there is a very compelling market opportunity in the development of an entertainment pack. And if you look at the flagship six, the flagship six is essentially the strongest entertainment pack you could get in the market, because you have preschool, kids, young adults, you have comedy, you\u2019ve got African-Americans and you\u2019re going to have a general marquee general entertainment network. And if you look at viewing shares and the like, that\u2019s a very significant cornerstone.","And so, I believe ultimately, the market will embrace that. Now, if you look at the UK as an example where big basic essentially doesn\u2019t exist, Sky runs packs. And you look at pack penetration, what you will see is that sports penetration is 52%, which actually is higher than I thought it would be. Entertainment pack penetration is 100%. And so, you look at the evolution of the market going forward, probably with MVPDs as a catalyst but with -- probably the MVPDs -- OTT plays as a catalyst, but ultimately MVPD is not far behind, it\u2019s hard to imagine that you don\u2019t see the emergence of this entertainment pack tier. And I think the flagship brands are ideally suited to ensure that Viacom greatly benefits from that development.","Ben Swinburne","Makes sense. And then, I\u2019ll just ask Wade a couple of quick follow-ups. But on your comment on the affiliate revenue, where I think you suggested that the March quarter would be slower than the December quarter. Was that a worldwide or domestic comment? I just wanted to ask if you could clarify. And then, could you just help us, what was the impact of the co-financing agreement in the quarter? I think you said ancillary revenues. Did it have any benefit to working capital in the quarter? When you talk about derisking 2017, maybe be a little more specific about what that means financially for us. Thanks.","Wade Davis","From an affiliate standpoint, my comment was really related to domestic. On a worldwide basis, we\u2019re going to be flat going into the second quarter. And so, obviously, it\u2019s going to be slightly higher growth internationally to offset the slightly lower growth domestically. I am sorry. Can you just repeat the question about working capital?","Ben Swinburne","Yes. You guys have generally talked about this co-financing deal at Paramount, derisking the slate. And I think you mentioned the ancillary revenues in the quarter benefitted from the financing. I think we\u2019re all looking for a little more specifics on how that agreement impacts the numbers, both in the quarter but just maybe generally for the year, even if it\u2019s directionally, is it helping free cash flow?","Wade Davis","It\u2019s going to significantly help free cash flow. In fact, the overall picture at Paramount with respect to free cash flow is impressive. The combination of the films -- the slate financing activities that we were able to execute, plus strong spend management, you\u2019re going to see an unwind of the cash loses from last year and a return to positive cash flow in that segment. So, that\u2019s a change of well over $1 billion in free cash flow. So, it\u2019s not just the slate financing but is driving the improvement in free cash flow at Paramount because we are very-focused on this and undertaking a number of other actions.","In terms of the impact in the quarter, it had a positive -- as we noted around ancillary revenues, it had a positive impact on ancillary revenues, as well as operating income, but not really much of an impact on cash in the quarter.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. ","Richard Greenfield","Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the last question about virtual MVPs and kind of what you call entertainment bundles. Some of your peers that I listen to, someone like Disney\u2019s Chairman, Bob Iger, they talk to with the every bundle that\u2019s going to be created, smaller bundles being focused around sports and that you can\u2019t have a bundle without sports. Do you think we\u2019re going to have a non-sports bundle at the low prices and high value that you\u2019ve mentioned during 2017? And, what do you think the catalyst is for that to actually come about? I mean, is there a leading candidate who might actually launch one of those that you\u2019re talking to? And then, just in terms of programming, I think your head of scripted programming in MTV left; you expanded your relationship with the Jersey Shore creators. It seems like there is a meaningful shift away from scripted towards reality. I would just love to better understand your thinking there and what are you trying to accomplish and why?","Bob Bakish","Sure, Rich. So, to your first question, I believe they will absolutely become an entertainment pack. Whether that will launch in 2017 or not, we\u2019ll see. There\u2019s lots of conversations going around. I\u2019m not going to name check any particular companies, but certainly there is activity in the marketplace.","On your question of MTV and its shift, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve talked about this in some other forums. But, MTV U.S. embarked on a very heavy scripted programming strategy some years back versus MTV international did not for a variety of reasons. Ultimately, the scripted strategy for MTV on a large scale basis didn\u2019t really work. And there is no question that under Chris\u2019s -- Chris McCarthy\u2019s leadership -- he is bringing back a better balance to MTV including a real push on reality, which is very attractive to the audience, has very compelling economics for us and is really right from a brand filter perspective too. At the same time, there are other elements of the MTV story. Music is another element of the MTV story, and live is going to be a third element of the MTV story. We have recently started to do some live packaging of our franchises on MTV on the weekends. And that live rollout will continue because we see a real opportunity and we are getting good early traction from a ladies and audience perspective. The last thing I would say is that as we do these three things, scripted is not going to go away, it still has a place on the grid with the brand, if you will, but it\u2019s just the balance is going to shift.","Richard Greenfield","And does it shift into things, I mean like you\u2019re seeing syndication pulling out something like Friends, which seems to skew you a bit more female than probably MTV has been in while? Do you think you end up syndicating content or using syndicated content as a way to be in the scripted business more than developing the content yourself?","Bob Bakish","So, couple of things. One is, when I talk to Chris about Friends, I was a little skeptical initially, but he showed me the research that actually the demographic is very -- has a strong connection to the show, and it\u2019s working well for us. It is also, just to be clear, a bridge strategy. We needed to reset MTV in a variety of ways and we saw an opportunity to take a lot of episodes of a show that\u2019s out there that had appealed to our target consumers from a research perspective and use it, which we are. Friends is now -- there is two other hours of Friends, I think from 6 to 8 on MTV and that\u2019s working well. But, it\u2019s also a bridge to get us time to implement a news slate of shows, which Chris and the team are actively working on and will begin coming to air in fiscal Q4.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael Morris","Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, you just mentioned Chris McCarthy\u2019s work over at MTV. He had success at VH1. And I think part of the success that I have heard you reference before is the use of data from your set-top box relationships and things like that to inform programming decisions. I was hoping you could expand on that a little bit. Is that a factor that\u2019s a new factor in your confidence in getting the right programming in front of the right people and how does that actually work? And then my second question is on the film financing partnership. If you could share anymore details. By all accounts, it looks like a great situation for the Company, as you look to move forward in that segment. But, I would assume, you have to give something up in order to strike that partnership. So, how should investors be thinking of whether you gave up upside or whether it\u2019s particular markets that perhaps you don\u2019t participate in anymore? Thanks.","Bob Bakish","Yes. So, to your first question, just to be clear, scheduling is about data and analysis, in a way always has been. And so, what we\u2019re seeing is a continued evolution of bringing facts to the table, if you will, to improve scheduling decisions. So, the comment is really about scheduling the network. It\u2019s not about program development; whether it\u2019s set-top boxes or any other kind of data, so just to be clear. And your second question, I am not sure I fully understood the question. Can you just recap it?","Michael Morris","Sure, absolutely. So, in order to strike the film partnership, you have a cash infusion or financing infusion\u2026","Bob Bakish","Okay, I get the question. So, you mean the slate financing deal?","Michael Morris","Exactly.","Bob Bakish","So, what it is, it\u2019s -- we essentially sold 25% interest in the slate; it\u2019s a multi-year deal, to these two entities. And therefore, they participate in the economic return on the film. They did not buy a set of markets or something like that which you might -- I mean, yes, there are deals like that typically in the television space and also the film space, but that\u2019s not what this is. This is selling the 25% interest in the slate.","Michael Morris","And so, it\u2019s a situation where should the films outperform, that\u2019s where your upside is limited versus not participating in let\u2019s say the Chinese market for example?","Wade Davis","No. We expect, in some instances get some operational and distribution benefit through our partnership with these entities. This is, as Bob said, this is an outright sale of the 25% interest in the entire slate with a couple of exceptions.","Bob Bakish","For example, we as Viacom still participate in the economic value created from these films in China. And actually, we believe this deal enhances that potential value, given the strategic presence of these companies in that market. But we didn\u2019t sell them the China window; we sold them essentially a global participation in the film.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. Bob, just a question on the bottom channels outside the top six. Is there an opportunity on the cost side near-term to optimize the cost base? And if you could give us some sense of what that opportunity looks like, that would be great. And secondly, just wanted to clarify a point on the Paramount cash flow turnaround; $1 billion, I may have missed this, $1 billion, is it over the period of the financing deal or is this over a shorter or longer timeframe? It would be great if you would clarify that, Wade? Thanks.","Bob Bakish","Yes. $1 billion is over a term, it\u2019s three years or so; we draw it as we need it. And Wade, I don\u2019t know\u2026","Wade Davis","I am sorry. Just to clarify, there might be some confusion, because we\u2019ve got two $1 billion numbers bouncing around. So, what Bob just was referring to is what we believe the amount of funding, financing that we\u2019ll receive out of this agreement over the three-year term. What I referenced was over a $1 billion of year-over-year improvement by the end of this fiscal year, in Paramount\u2019s free cash flow. So, the two things are somewhat related. And as much as some of the $1 billion from the slate financing is coming into this year and improving some amount of Paramount\u2019s free cash flow year-over-year, but I want to be very clear that that\u2019s not the only element that is driving the improvement of over a$1 billion in year-over-year cash flow improvement upcoming.","Bob Bakish","And then, to your first question on the reinforcing networks, I would say a couple of things. One is, again, there are strong networks that are included in this category, networks like TV Land, like CMT, VH1 that have real prospects going forward. They are not though global prospects; they are not film prospects, hence the segmentation. As we implement the flagship six strategy, we will be looking at resources, and we will do some inevitable shift in resources. But again, you should not interpret this as a light switch move of a whole bunch of networks going away, because that\u2019s not what this is about. This is about focusing resources to drive the highest possible performance of these flagship six plans, both on a consumer connection level, which benefits -- which is driven by multi-platform exposure and increased content commitment et cetera. But, it\u2019s not a light switch turning off a whole bunch of networks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet.","Anthony DiClemente","Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about, again, the flagship six, kind of a follow-up on that strategy, and the implications for that in terms of negotiations with your distributors. Bob, you said it a second ago that it\u2019s not a light switch for those to be kind of shutting down. But, over time, over a longer period of time, is the idea that as the value proposition improves for the flagship six, that affiliate fees for those networks specifically will go up? It\u2019s, I guess, hard to argue that affiliates use per network for like a VH1 will go up, if you\u2019re deemphasizing that. So, I just wanted to get the long-term economic implications of the flagship six strategy with your affiliate agreements.","Bob Bakish","Yes. So, look, it\u2019s very early days to get into a very specific financial discussion around how components of the P&L may evolve over the next X years. Suffice it to say, we believe the strategy strengthens Viacom\u2019s position across a range of considerations on a going forward basis. We believe it will, among other things, benefit our distribution clients by making these brands stronger and having their consumers serve even better. And by the way, by having these non-television attributes, it also provides us opportunities to work with our distribution clients in different ways. For example, as Nickelodeon has this increasing life in the physical world, there is an opportunity for subscribers to MVPDs, either on a Sweepstakes or some other basis to enjoy those experiences. As you get into film business, there is opportunities for consumers of pay TV to get some unique experiences. So, there is a variety of opportunities that are a function of this strategy. And again, our overall focus with respect to distribution -- and that seems to be at the core of your question, is now working to broaden and strengthen our partnership with these very important clients.","Wade Davis","Just to follow up on the economics. Historically, we\u2019ve really always gotten paid for the portfolio. And this is a move that\u2019s designed to strengthen the portfolio. These networks, as Bob said, are not going to go away; they are going to move into supporting roles, helping to strengthen the flagship six which we think again is going to strengthen the portfolio and create more opportunities. And just to reference what Bob said earlier, as we move potentially towards entertainment packs and products like that, this will be a must have element, cornerstone of the entertainment viewership in the pay TV landscape. So, again, it\u2019s really about the portfolio as a whole, portfolio management, and we\u2019re confident that that\u2019s going to be a better value proposition overall.","Bob Bakish","And just to add one other sort of element to the discussion, a number people have asked me, why did CMT and TV Land move under Spike, now the Paramount Network? And the answer is very simple which is all three of those networks have pretty balanced male, female audiences targeted adult demographics and therefore, we believe can benefit in terms of co-management. And that\u2019s another example of our assets being a way to support the flagship six. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all the other things get rebranded to flagship six. I don\u2019t want anyone to think that. But it means, working as a portfolio to reinforce an overall strategy that will strengthen our position, again, across a variety of dimensions.","Jim Bombassei","We want to thank everybody for joining us for our earnings call.","Bob Bakish","Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for our March quarter.

Redstone","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It was another successful quarter for Viacom. Our leading Media Networks and Paramount Pictures continued to attract large audiences all around the world. We have an outstanding management team [indiscernible] every single day.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to the leader of that team, my good friend, the wisest man I have ever known, Philippe Dauman.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you very much, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2014 fiscal year.","Viacom had a strong quarter. The company achieved steady growth in quarterly revenues, earnings and operating income. Our media networks delivered strong top and bottom line growth even as we grew our investment in original programming. Ratings were up for the majority of our networks and we saw the successful run of Paramount Pictures' The Wolf of Wall Street, and the #1 debut of Noah, a bona fide global hit.","Let's take a quick look at our financial performance for the quarter. Tom and Wade will go into greater detail in a moment.","Revenues increased to $3.17 billion, reflecting both higher affiliate fees of advertising revenues in our Media Networks. Operating income rose 3% to $872 million. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $482 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $1.08.","Viacom's balance sheet is strong. We remain committed to returning significant value to our shareholders while investing in great content and the growth of our business worldwide. In the March quarter, we repurchased $850 million in stock under our ongoing stock repurchase program. This quarter, we also plan to repurchase $850 million in stock, and expect our buyback for the September ending fiscal year to exceed $3.25 billion.","We are very pleased to announce this morning that we have agreed to acquire the United Kingdom's Channel 5 broadcasting for GBP 450 million to be funded by our international cash on hand. After we close, we expect the transaction will be accretive to Viacom on an operating income basis in the first year. Channel 5's diverse programming slate will complement Viacom's popular pay-TV networks. We believe that we will be able to invest in more programming for Channel 5 that will make the channel even more vibrant and utilize some of that programming on our UK pay channels and even more importantly, on our existing and future networks around the world. We look forward to welcoming Channel 5's accomplished executives and employees into the Viacom family for the very exciting future ahead.","As I mentioned, our Media Networks had a great quarter. Ratings were up on a year-over-year basis at many of our networks, including Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, VH1, CMT, SPIKE and TV Land. Our Media Networks segment grew total advertising by 3% and domestic advertising by 2% in the March quarter. In the current quarter, we expect domestic advertising to grow mid-single-digits.","On the distribution side, total affiliate revenue increased by 10% in the quarter, and we concluded with the successful completion of our deal with the NCTC, the National Cable Television Cooperative. We also continue to drive value for distributors by launching new branded apps for our channels, including the recent Comedy Central and BET NOW apps. Across Viacom, our apps were downloaded at a rate of more than 1 million times per month in the March quarter.","For the second straight quarter, Nickelodeon was the #1 network for kids 2 to 11. Ratings grew 4%, while its 2 biggest competitors saw significant declines. Nickelodeon's ratings have now increased year-on-year for 15 consecutive months. Nickelodeon can lay claim to 8 out of the top 10 shows for kids in the current broadcast season. The network's continued dominance in preschool is a big part of this success. Wallykazam! debuted in the quarter as Nick's highest-rated preschool series and strengthens a formidable lineup which includes PAW Patrol, Dora the Explorer and Bubble Guppies. Nickelodeon also had the top 5 animated series in the March quarter, including the newly launched Breadwinners and of course, SpongeBob SquarePants, which is as strong as ever approaching its 15th birthday. Live action is strong for Nick, too. Sam and Cat gave the network the top-rated show with kids 2 to 11 and The Thundermans and The Haunted Hathaways followed closely on its heels.","The content pipeline in Nickelodeon is rich. At its recent upfront presentation, the network introduced 10 new series, along with a tent-pole, the Kid's Choice Sports 2014 to be hosted and executive produced by Michael Strahan.","MTV, more than any network, has an imperative for reinvention. The network must anticipate changing tastes and trends among its young audience. A bold period of reinvention is at hand at MTV. Even as the network continues to launch unscripted hits like Catfish, it is doubling down on scripted fare with a trio of smart, complex new series coming to air this year. Each explores the universally relatable youth theme of self-discovery through a different lens.","Faking It just debuted as MTV's highest-rated new scripted premiere in 2 years. The show gives a humorous high school take on evolving social attitudes towards sexual orientation. Happyland is a mother-daughter comedy that touches on the Latino experience in America. And Finding Carter is a mystery drama with an absolutely gripping plot that we believe can connect with a very broad audience. These shows will appeal not only to our younger audience, but to their older siblings and young parents as well. Of course, this reinvention also extends to how fans interact and connect with the brand. MTV is undertaking an exciting new initiative to transform the viewer experience. The network is building a new team to focus on real-time interstitial coverage of cultural and social media events each day. Think the quick hit video pieces invented by MTV but produced on-the-fly throughout the day to reflect trending topics, extending the network's always-on dialogue with its audience. MTV is hiring top editorial and design staff, including Richard Turley, the award-winning former creative director of Bloomberg Businessweek, and investing in upgrades to its tech infrastructure to get this concept up and running. It's a fresh new approach, and from a sales perspective, it will shorten commercial pause for our advertisers and allow us to give A positions to multiple clients. It will also enable marketers to buy into trending cultural conversations at the scale that only television can offer.","Coming off 6 consecutive months of primetime ratings growth, VH1 is working to build consistent strength in Thursday primetime and establish another solid night on Wednesdays to extend the success of its powerhouse Monday night lineup. The network is seeking loud, fun shows with a high celebrity quotient. It has increased its stable of production partners, resulting in 10 new series coming to air through the beginning of 2015. Additionally, VH1 is building on its music movie franchise, successfully launched with CrazySexyCool; with Drumline 2, starring Nick Cannon. Like Being Mary Jane on BET, we think Drumline can pave the way for an ongoing series if it connects with audiences.","CMT is building on major growth. Ratings were up 26% in the March quarter, with more and more original programming, including 20 hours of programming from its new CMT docks [ph] unit and a new CMT Crossroads with Katy Perry and Kacey Musgraves.","Without a doubt, Comedy Central is the place right now for young comedic talent. Thanks to its successful investment in new original series, anchored by fresh voices like Key & Peele, Broad City and Inside Amy Schumer; and Chris Hardwick of @midnight, a rethinking of the late night talk show that is growing its audience every month and attracting double the social media traffic of The Tonight Show. Much of this talent, including Amy, came up through what Comedy Central refers to as its farm team system, a roster of young comics and nurtures through sponsored tours, records, home video and Sirius radio channel. New originals have powered Comedy Central to its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year ratings growth. That success is fueling demand on all platforms from the new Comedy Central app to the newly relaunched sites for Daily Show and Colbert.","Speaking of Colbert, Comedy Central looks forward to sending him off in style in these next 8 months, and we're excited about the opportunity to reinvent late-night television again in the 11:30 slot beginning in 2015.","SPIKE also continues to see strength from its originals, including its 2 biggest series Bar Rescue and Ink Master. Two new extensions of the Bar Rescue franchise, Hungry Investors and Frankenfoods are coming to Spike in the current quarter.","At BET Networks, the team is hard at work planning the second annual BET Experience, set for this June in Los Angeles. BET has created a number of new sponsorship opportunities around the festival, which will again serve as a strong promotional platform for the BET Awards. In the current broadcast season, BET has the top 3 sitcoms on cable among adults 18 to 49 with The Game, Real Husbands of Hollywood and Let's Stay Together.","And CENTRIC, coming off its most-watched quarter ever, recently announced plans to develop a lineup of new original programming for African-American women in partnership with Queen Latifah.","Internationally, we're reaping benefits from our decision to move MTV Brazil, Italy and Russia to owned and operated models last year. All 3 have grown ratings, revenue and reach in the interim. Overall, our international ad sales grew double digits this past quarter. In the 6 months since its relaunch, MTV Brazil has risen from the 30th to the 16th ranked network in its core demo in a very crowded marketplace. Ratings for MTV Italy grew 31% year-over-year in the March quarter. The March quarter also saw MTV launch in the Philippines, as well as the launch of the Paramount channel in Russia and Hungary. And as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, we are truly excited by the potential Channel 5 will bring to us, not just in the U.K., but in our operations around the world.","Beyond our screens, we are aggressively executing a low-risk licensing strategy for stores and recreation to extend our brand presence globally and continuing to expand our consumer products business to drive our bottom line.","Moving over to Filmed Entertainment, Paramount Pictures achieved success in the March quarter with the extended run of Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street and the #1 debut of Darren Aronofsky's Noah. Noah continues to be a big hit with international theatergoers as well. The success of these films demonstrates not only their outstanding quality, but also the continued ability of Paramount to connect broad audiences with challenging, creatively ambitious filmmaking.","Paramount also successfully launched Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, yet another very profitable film from its in-surge label. As we head into the summer tent-pole season, Paramount's exciting release slate includes Transformers: Age of Extinction, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Hercules.","There's great momentum at Paramount Television as well. The unit recently announced its new leadership team with production and development executives who've worked on a wide range of hits from Walking Dead to South Park. And just this week, Paramount Television announced its first major network production, a 3-hour live broadcast of the hit musical Grease for FOX. This gives you an idea of the kind of ambitious and diverse projects the new unit intends to pursue. It also pulled back the curtain on a number of additional projects in development. We have projects inspired by Paramount hits, including The Truman Show and Narc, as well as the Terminator franchise. We are also developing a series based on the best-selling mystery novel The Alienist with the executive producers of True Detective, and a limited run series based on A. Scott Berg's Pulitzer Prize winning biography, Lindbergh. We see a sellers' market for these types of rich, character-driven shows, and we're excited to get them into production.","To close, Viacom is in great shape. We are positioned for an era of growth for our company. We continue to invest in programming and films that resonate with audiences worldwide and drive the businesses of our marketing and distribution partners. We remain focused on mining the many growth opportunities at hand for content creators, both at home and abroad and on new devices. As a result, we see sustainable, high-single to low double-digit growth at affiliate revenues, an improving environment for ad sales in the U.S. and abroad, great potential for significant growth in our international business, consumer products revenue and new initiatives at Paramount and throughout our company. As all these initiatives bear fruit, we will continue to deliver results, create value and return substantial capital to our shareholders.","Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.","Wade C. Davis","Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter are available on our website.","Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 6% compared with the prior year, principally driven by increases in affiliate and advertising revenues. Domestic revenues were up 6%, while international revenues grew 10%. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.","In terms of advertising, domestic revenues were up 2% in the quarter and international revenues increased 14%. The growth in international advertising reflects the impact of new channels, as well as continued improvement in the European marketplace. In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 11% in the quarter, while international revenues were up 7%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high-single-digits in the quarter. Growth in the international revenues was due to increases in subscribers, new channel launches, as well as higher rates. Expenses increased 5% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 5%. SG&A expense increased 6%, reflecting advertising and promotion expense related to the marketing of original series and specials, as well as the impact of new channels in international markets.","Media Networks' adjusted operating income was up 9%, and the adjusted operating income margin was 40%, an increase of approximately 90 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin increase was driven by top line growth of 6%, partially offset by 5% growth in expenses.","Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were down 12% in the quarter, principally due to declines in home entertainment and theatrical revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.","Theatrical revenues decreased 17%, reflecting lower carryover revenues from prior quarter releases. Home entertainment revenues declined 30%, principally due to fewer releases in the quarter, as well as lower carryover revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $11 million in the quarter, as compared to $65 million last year. The decrease principally reflects the number and mix of current year releases.","In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 33%, reflecting a 150-basis-point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily driven by the mix of domestic versus international profitability.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thanks, Wade. Good morning, everyone. Let me talk about our cash flow and debt profile, as well as the return of capital to shareholders. I'll also cover the seasonal factors that impact the remainder of our 2014 fiscal year.","For the quarter, we generated $524 million in operating free cash flow compared to $700 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow for the quarter was principally due to higher cash taxes and cash interest. The increase in cash taxes was primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments during the year. As for our debt, it is principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%.","During the March quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to maintain our leverage ratio at our target level by issuing a total of $1.5 billion of senior notes and debentures in a combination of 5-, 10- and 30-year maturities. On April 3, a portion of the new issuance proceeds was used to redeem the $600 million of outstanding 4.375% senior notes that were due September of 2014. The new debt was issued at an average rate commensurate with our overall cost of debt, and taken together with the redemption, allowed us to extend our weighted average maturity.","In terms of short-term funding needs, to the extent, we have incremental borrowings. We are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 20 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end. As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.4 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x. But taking into consideration the April 3 redemption of the $600 million of senior notes, our leverage ratio was 2.9x, and of course, our cash balance decreased to $2 billion. At March 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.","Our commitment to return capital to shareholders continued in the March quarter. During the quarter, we returned a total of $850 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 432 million shares outstanding. For the June quarter, we are on a pace to purchase approximately $850 million of our stock, which means that for the first 9 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $3 billion to our shareholders.","Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of the fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, we continue to see long-term annual growth in the high-single-digit and low-double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transaction and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the June quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will be flat compared to the prior year. However, we expect that affiliate revenue will grow double-digits in the September quarter. For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the mid- to high-single-digits. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.","For 2014, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 33%, reflecting the mix of domestic versus international profitability. At Filmed Entertainment, we are very excited about our upcoming summer tent-pole releases including Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.","Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline, we are currently in production on the hybrid, live-action and CGI animated film, Monster Trucks, which is directed by Chris Wedge and is scheduled for release in May of 2014. We have started production on a Terminator reboot, which is in coproduction and partnership with Skydance and we recently wrapped production on The Gambler, which stars Mark Wahlberg in the lead role.","The studio is also currently in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises, including Mission: Impossible, Star Trek, G.I. Joe and World War Z.","In summary, we continue to invest in our brands and franchises, developing new revenue streams and diversifying existing ones.","At Media Networks, we continue to grow our global footprint, launching new channels and apps in the international marketplace. Nickelodeon continues to grow its consumer product and licensing businesses, having developed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into the #1 live-action figure in the United States. And the launch of the new animated series Dora and Friends this summer and Paramount's release of the SpongeBob Movie early next year will create new merchandise and licensing opportunities for these enduring franchises.","At Filmed Entertainment, we will release the first titles from our in-house animation division in 2015 and in conjunction with this, the studio will be developing merchandising opportunities tied to these films. Paramount's also getting back into the television production business, seeking to capitalize on increasing demand for original content from broadcast, cable and pay TV networks. These initiatives will enhance both our top and bottom line growth, and combined with our focus on managing cost and returning capital, we will drive additional value for our shareholders.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So Philippe, a couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit more about the conversations you're having with advertisers around the upfront process and what your expectations might be for price per volume this year? And I was at The Cable Show, there was a lot of discussion around putting Netflix and the other SVOD providers as a channel in the cable box. And as you approach your conversations and your modeling around -- since you guys are the arms suppliers, the likes of Amazon, the licensees that you are charging, did you consider the fact or are you worried at all about the fact that there could be increased viewership competition as those guys start to get integrated in the cable box over time?","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you, Doug. As far as our heading into the upfront, we've had some very successful presentations to advertisers. I mentioned in my remarks all the new series and events that we have planned across our networks, including our major ones, like Nickelodeon, MTV, where we had blockbuster presentations, but also some of our other networks that people generally don't think much about like CMT. So we are very well positioned based on the strength of the programming across the board. We see an improving environment as we go forward, so we anticipate very successful upfront market for us. And many of the categories that are showing strength are the categories that are squarely in our wheelhouse, like electronics, wireless, the kids' marketplace, the movies, the way they're skewed for the rest of the year and into next year, the kind of franchise that are out there. So we see a lot of opportunity as we look forward. As far as the SVOD distributors, we always face competition. We live in a world where we are suppliers of programming, as you so aptly put it. We are, to some degree, the arms merchants. We can be selective in what we provide, what we make available when, how, the content that we put on the SVOD operators serve to promote new episodes, new seasons, new shows, drive our consumer products business. There are a lot of aspects to how we distribute our programming on different windows. And as far as competition goes, we live in a competitive world. It is our core strength to build brands and great programming, and we are just continuing to step up the pace on that, and the results show. We see a lot of opportunity. You focus on the set-top box, we see opportunities beyond that in the mobile environment; not just in the U.S. but around the world. And we have geared our whole organization to play successfully in that world.","Operator","Our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. The first one is on the acceleration of domestic advertising growth that you're seeing in the fiscal third quarter. I guess, what specifically is driving that? Is it the healthier marketplace? Is it better movie slate in that quarter? Is it Easter to a certain degree? And will that continue for the rest of the year?","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you, Alexia. Well, many of the factors that you mentioned, we did see some movie releases move out of the March quarter into the next couple of quarters. So certainly, that will help us, given what a strong category that is. You're quite right that Easter is in this quarter and certainly, in particular, for the Nickelodeon business, that makes a difference as we had in this quarter. And as I mentioned in answer to Doug's question, some of our key categories are strengthening categories. When you look at the competitive environment that exists in mobile, wireless, in electronics, in quick service restaurants, the breakfast meal wars and all these competitive categories, these provide strength for us. And of course, the strength of our networks, as well as the integrated marketing capabilities that we are providing to our advertisers. We are the leaders in that, and that is exactly what advertisers are looking for. And we are going to them with those offerings. We are getting more deeply embedded with social media and providing entire packages. So that's serving us well currently and will serve us well as we look into the next broadcast year in the upfronts.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just to follow up, if I can, on the acquisition. You guys have been really very aggressive in your buybacks historically, at least the last few years. And I guess, given this acquisition, I guess, can you update us on your priorities for use of cash going forward? I know you mentioned the buybacks for this year. Do you still expect to be that aggressive going forward? And I guess, maybe any commentary if we should expect further acquisitions or how the pipeline looks.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, let me emphasize, we have a strong commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. Now as I've always said, we don't see any big, transformative transactions in our future, but we do look for targeted opportunities and intellectual property and in the international environment. This Channel 5 opportunity, in a very strong market in general, and for us, in particular, just really fit the bill. It will be accretive right away and it's done well. We think we can take Channel 5 and its family of networks to the next level, utilizing some of the programming and capabilities that we have on our pay channels in the U.K., taking advantage of the vibrant U.K. production marketplace. We are going to step up, as we are doing around the world, in our production activities, increase the mix of original programming. That will allow us to grow the U.K. business and will provide us with another bucket of programming that we can distribute across Continental Europe and around the world, including the U.S., given what a fount of creativity there is in Britain. So we're excited by the fact that this increases our potential. And as a global company, we have the ability to take what has heretofore been a local business into a much bigger place. So we're very excited. This will add to our operating income, add to our growth, and...","Wade C. Davis","Alexia, let me just add to Philippe's remark, I mean, it's a great strategic transaction, but it's also very elegantly structured from a financial point of view. And that will have -- the cash being used here is not cash that would've been available for the share buyback program. These are international proceeds that are pretty much kept offshore, and as a result, they were invested at rates that are sub-1%, very conservative investment return. So this investment will yield a very high incremental return of -- in terms of what it offers shareholders and the company. And it's kind of unique in that regard in terms of its characteristics, and it also comes with about GBP 125 million of net losses that we can apply to future income here. So it's a very attractive transaction from a financial point of view, and Philippe outlined all the strategic attractive elements of it, but it will not impact the buyback program at all.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I have a couple on Channel 5, and can I just ask one to Tom quickly? When you guys say it's accretive, are you assuming something for amortization within that accretion? Or is it accretive on cash EPS and cash earnings?","Thomas E. Dooley","Michael, we think about half of the purchase price is goodwill. We have to actually go through a valuation exercise to get exactly the right numbers. But for modeling purposes, you could take about half of the purchase price, allocate it to goodwill and the balance of the purchase price would be amortized somewhere between 10 and 15 years.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then I have 2 for Philippe on Channel 5. One is, I believe in the U.K, Viacom uses BSkyB as their sales agent versus Channel 5 sells directly to the market. How do you think you guys will integrate Channel 5 sales team into your network business, and that's one?","Philippe P. Dauman","Michael, our current intention is to continue with business as usual in the ad sales house. They have operated very successfully. Of course, we just signed the agreement yesterday. We are moving forward. Our real focus in making this acquisition was the combined programming opportunities, distribution opportunities, the cross-marketing opportunities that we see here. For example, there's a very successful children's block on Channel 5 called Milkshake! It has some Nickelodeon programming on it now. We think by marrying Milkshake! with some of the Nickelodeon capabilities and programming, there is opportunity to grow both sides of the house once we are able to close this transaction. So that's really been our focus. And again, it's a broadcasting asset that can work well with our pay channels, but it has its own characteristics.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, and then the other question would be, you mentioned the original programming, is there any history or any financial history of them selling their content overseas either to other networks or SVOD? Or is that simply untapped financial opportunity?","Philippe P. Dauman","I think to some limited degree, thus far, I think it's an untapped opportunity. So as you look forward, we will, as we do, we tell you consistently that Viacom's overall programming investment is growing at mid-single to high-single-digits every year. I think that's a good prospect in the U.K. for us to do that. And as we increase our investment across our networks in the U.K., we will also probably shift the mix toward more original programming. And that will allow us to enrich the programming experience in the U.K, but also allow for greater monetization given that this will be more programming that we own. And I believe we'll be able to use and re-purpose some of that programming in our U.S. channels. And another exciting thing to me, as you know, we are planning to launch more brands internationally, and the programming that we develop in the U.K., when added to the programming we develop in the U.S. and the local programming we produce in other geographies, will accelerate our ability to launch new brands, targeted at new demographics around the world.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Greenfield of BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First off, when you look at calendar Q1, you mentioned that the movie schedule was light or things got pushed out. But are there anything kind of uniquely when you look at calendar Q1, that seems to make it one of your slower quarters advertising-wise versus other quarters throughout the year? And then just a big picture conceptual question. Sports programming seems to be something that all of your peers seem to be focusing more of their time and attention on. You've obviously done a little bit for SPIKE. But just wondering your appetite for increasing your overall exposure to sports programming to ensure or accelerate your subscriber fees.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you. Thank you, Rich. Yes, there were some movies that did move out of calendar Q1 or fiscal Q2. But also, if you look back on last year and the year before, you do see in the general marketplace, this time of year end of first calendar quarter, beginning of second calendar quarter, you see a pattern of what the demand is in the marketplace for a variety of reasons, and then it builds as the calendar second quarter continues. And we are seeing that, particularly in categories that we have particular relative strength in. As far as sports-related programming, one, yes, as you point out, we have some participation in that. But as you look at some of the programming that we have, for example, the new event that we're going to have on Nickelodeon, hosted by Michael Strahan, The Kids' Choice Sports 2014, that takes advantage of the vibrancy of sports. If you look at MTV2, we have programming tied in with Major League Baseball that -- they are very interested in working with us. So we are looking at opportunities where we can. There may be some opportunities internationally as well, and that was one of the rationales behind our getting involved with Bellator here in the U.S. We see that as potential programming as we roll out the SPIKE brand, if we roll that out internationally, that would be a natural there. So we look at those opportunities, but we're very focused on having a broad range of programming that has that live event -- that eventized appeal like sports does. So that could be the [indiscernible], but it could also mean fresh series that animate social conversation. So it's really not so much of sports, it's really having fresh, current vibrant content of all kinds, including sports-related content, that counts.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","It seems like the last couple of years, there has been generally lower volumes of scatter budgets available if advertisers try to lock in higher [ph] budgets and share in advance. I was wondering if that's what you're seeing, that there's still just a lower volume of budget share up for grabs in scatter in general? Separately, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about TV license fees. There's growth there for the first quarter in a while and so I'd love to hear what you think is what's driving that.","Philippe P. Dauman","What was the second question? I didn't quite hear it.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I apologize for the background noise here. I was wondering about TV license fees. We saw growth there for the first quarter in a while, so I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what's driving that?","Philippe P. Dauman","The license fees in the -- in which part of our business?","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I'm sorry, in the studio.","Philippe P. Dauman","The studio. Okay, thank you. Well, as far as the scatter market, it really depends on what categories you're looking at, and there's not a constant theme there. It really depends on what categories become competitive, what the plans year-to-year are of different major advertisers. There have been some years where major advertisers have decided to make a large commitment in the upfront; in other years, they decided they were just going to play the scatter market. So there's no particular rule to follow there in the broader market, and of course, we have different areas of strength in that market. As far as the TV license fees' strength, when you look at the opportunities for content and new networks being created around the world, including our own, that presents new opportunities for Paramount. And a lot of it also depends on the cycle of existing deals.","Thomas E. Dooley","Product availability.","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes. Product availability with licenses when they get -- they're up for renewal, particularly on different packages in movies as we go ahead in the pay license cycle. So there are a number of opportunities, and this year, Paramount has, as the year progresses, a number of opportunities in play.","Operator","Our next question will come Vijay Jayant from International Strategy Investment Group.","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is David Joyce for Vijay. I was just wondering if you can provide some more color on Channel 5. What their revenue stream mix is like there compared to the other European assets? When the carriage agreements might be coming due? And then separately, in the U.S., there's been an increase in uptake of skinny packages probably capturing some of the people who may be cord cutters or cord narrowers. I'm just wondering if there's been any impact on your subscriber base there?","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, so as far as Channel 5, the very large majority of revenues there, just to size it for you, the revenues of Channel 5 is approximately, in U.S. dollar terms, about $600 million as of this past year. It's largely advertising. This is a broadcast family of channels, and it's public sector broadcasting channel in the U.K. So think of it in that way as compared to our pay networks, where we also have affiliate revenues. This is largely driven by that, as well as some other revenues relating to programming and consumer products, where by the way, we see some opportunities to enhance our consumer products business by promotion on Channel 5. As far as your question relating to the so-called cord cutters. Look, we live in an environment where we are seeing our affiliate revenues grow. We are very encouraged by the fact that distributors are providing more robust TV Everywhere capabilities, meaning that users in general, and in particular the young viewers, which support many of our networks, will be able to access programming in the way they want and we believe that will entice people who are starting out without these broader subscriptions to subscribe as they get older. We've always seen some delay in young people getting out into the workplace and signing up for subscriptions, so that's not in and of itself a new phenomenon. But we are also providing content and we will be providing more content directly on mobile devices. But I think you will see more reinforcement of the subscription model as more functionality is implemented by the distribution community.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I just wondered if you could talk about -- in your last call, you had said you expected acceleration in the quarter in domestic ad growth, and just what changed -- you mentioned some movies moving out of the quarter, maybe that was it, but if there's anything else that affected the ad growth in fiscal Q2?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, Doug, that was really the difference for us in terms of having improved ad sales growth domestically in this quarter compared to last quarter. So that was -- there were a lot of ins and outs. But if you can pinpoint one thing for us, that would be it, given how important the movie category is to us. Now the converse of that is that the date changes on these movies pushed them into the latter half of our year. So on a full year basis, we will benefit from the marketing relating to those movies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov of Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Tom, I have a 2 part question for you about consumer product licensing. In your prepared remarks, you highlighted all those opportunities coming up in the next several quarters. So looking at your ancillary revenue in the networks for the past couple of years, that -- it looks pretty flattish. So are those new opportunities, are they a result of some renewed focus on this revenue stream for you? And then after that, can you tell us what competition is like in the market, because I'm sure you know every peer of yours is hoping for growth in the consumer product license category, Frozen and the Marvel characters and Star Wars at Disney, DreamWorks Animation with Dragon 2 and so on and so on. How do you see the market? Is there -- is competition benign enough for you to count on substantial success there?","Thomas E. Dooley","That's a good question, Vasily. Thank you for it. We do see this category, both from a revenue and a bottom line contribution, increasing both throughout the rest of this year and certainly, into the future years. And it is competitive, but that's why it's important to have something -- a franchise like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles where you're #1. And I think that will continue to be our focus. And as you noted in my remarks and I noted in my remarks, we continue to focus on franchises that have very much a toyetic appeal that will put us as a very competitive player in that marketplace. Until those shows, movies get made and get up and on the air, it'll be hard to predict the outcomes, but we're in this business for the long run. We see the tremendous success others have had in it. We put in place in the organizations to take advantage of it, and we have great content and IP to drive that business into the future.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","But you don't feel like that ship has sailed and you're late to the game and the market is taken over by competitors and there's just no room for your properties there?","Thomas E. Dooley","I mean, it's not a question of room. It's a question of which properties resonate with the kids. And our goal and given our franchises and, certainly, having a very strong franchise in terms of being able to platform that product with children in general, so like Nickelodeon, that is a big opportunity for us. In the rest of ancillary revenue though, some of the growth that consumer products will drive will be offset by some of the declines in home entertainment and the ability to sell product in that marketplace as DVD sales related to the Media Networks side of the house continue to decline.","Philippe P. Dauman","I guess I would add on that is as you see some stabilization strengthening in European consumer markets and growth of retail in emerging markets, that creates a bigger pie in consumer products as we look forward in the years ahead.","Operator","We'll go next to Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess, on Channel 5, can you guys give us a sense for what the margins of that business looks like today, or how it might compare to your core international portfolio today? And I think Philippe, you've talked about a 30% OICAGR before your international portfolio pre-Channel 5 over the several years. Can you just talk about how this asset may or may not lift that growth outlook if you see sort of retransmission fee [indiscernible] trajectory we've seen in the U.S. taking place in the U.K. And then, Tom, I don't know if you'd be willing to give this to us on the advertising side, but can just remind us of the Easter shift in dollars? I'm trying to get a sense for what -- from the March to June quarter trend is if we normalize for Easter on the domestic ad front.","Philippe P. Dauman","Ben, let me pick up, and then Tom will follow-up on the Channel 5 and international in general. So what I've said on our international business is that we expect to see that grow strong double-digits looking forward. And as reflected in the Channel 5 investment, we are committed to growing our international business primarily organically, but where we see opportunities that are very additive like Channel 5, and these opportunities do not present themselves often, we will take advantage of that, and that will certainly accelerate our growth. We just signed the agreement to buy Channel 5. We have some ideas on how we can grow and invest in that business. And certainly, our good executives on both sides of the house have some good ideas, but in the months to come, as we move toward closing the transaction, we will gel a plan to see how we can grow that U.K.-based business. And let me just repeat how committed we are to growing and investing in our U.K. business and what exciting opportunities there are ahead. And we think that Channel 5 will be a very complementary part of our global content and branded distribution business. Tom?","Thomas E. Dooley","Specifically, Ben, the margin on Channel 5 is consistent with the margin of our total international business, and that's low- to mid-teen type margins. And we do believe that, as Philippe said, that we can have expansion in both the margin of our entire international business and the margin of Channel 5 as we move forward in growing international marketplaces.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then on the domestic ad question?","Thomas E. Dooley","Sorry, what was it again?","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just as you normalize Easter, can you just remind us how much dollars that usually is...","Andrew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's about 1.5 points of growth, 1.5 points of growth that shifts.","Operator","We'll go next to Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So much of the content on Channel 5 seems to be stuff that they're licensing from others. I know you've talked about the opportunity to tap more into kind of local U.K. production. I was just wondering if you could highlight for us what are kind of the key shows that they're making over there that might make sense to think about taking back to the U.S. or moving to other markets? What are the key content franchises you're getting?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, Barton, yes, as you pointed out, there are a lot of acquired programming there. I mean, for example, the Big Brother franchise is very popular there. They got CSI and other acquired U.S. programming, as well as in U.K. There is some original production taking place. It's been just a very recent investment on their part in that regard, so we're going to continue that direction. And as we look for programming and commission programming from the very diverse creative community there, we will look for shows that will work, obviously, first and foremost, on Channel 5, but we will have an eye to the kind of shows that will also live well in different windows in the U.K., but on our other networks around the world. We think there's a lot of possible cooperation between our U.S., for certain of our networks, between the U.S. and the U.K. in both directions for Channel 5. So we have the opportunity to just take -- not give up what there is there now, but evolve it. And again, with our orientation toward original programming, we'll be able to accelerate what they've already been doing there.","Thomas E. Dooley","Barton, it's also important to distinguish while some of them are acquisitions, they are format acquisitions. As in the case of Big Brother, where it's the format of the show, and then they produce that show on their own air, so it becomes their own show with the -- in the version of a Big Brother format. So that's an important distinction. It's not like they just acquire the show that's made here and put it over there.","Philippe P. Dauman","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that will come from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just not to belabor the questions on Channel 5, but I'm just trying to reconcile. So it sounds like you said that you expect margin expansion at Channel 5, but that you also expect to increase the production investment in the U.K. So am I just -- is this just the difference between maybe like year 1 step-up in production expenses, but then you'll get a revenue follow through in successive years to kind of expand margins over the CAGR? Or do you just really expect the revenue acceleration in year 1 to offset the increased production expenses you mentioned? Just trying to kind of reconcile that.","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, well, so there is -- as we go forward across all of our channels, we look to grow the revenue pie. And the way to do that is to increase our programming investment. That is the lifeblood of our company. And as we make more programming, we then have the opportunity to find ways to monetize it in various windows, whether it's SVOD, whether it's licensing in other territories and the like. So there's already a programming development taking place. We can look at it, modify, evolve it as we go forward. It's within our existing business plan as well as Channel 5's existing business plan to increase programming investment year after year. That's how you build the business. That's how they built the business to get to this point, and we're not going to interrupt that trajectory. We are going to enhance it.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.","Operator","Thank you. That does concludes today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for our March quarter.

Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.","Sumner M. Redstone","[Audio Gap]","You to Viacom's Second Quarter Conference Call. Once again, our outstanding team delivered on its proven strategy to grow our business and drive value for shareholders. Today, Viacom's brands are better than ever. Our creative operative is booming. We are making smart, sustainable use of exciting new distribution measures and technologies.","At the heart of this effort is Viacom's outstanding executive team led by its incomparable CEO, Philippe Dauman. His expertise and wisdom continue to guide Viacom's success and fuel our ability to deliver the outstanding returns our shareholders have come to expect.","Now it is my pleasure to introduce my friend, my colleague, the wisest man I have ever known, Philippe Dauman.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you very much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss the second quarter of Viacom's 2013 fiscal year.","Our results for the March quarter were highlighted by our return to positive advertising revenue growth driven by continued ratings' momentum at our Media Networks. Nickelodeon posted solid year-over-year gains, with ratings up 7% and up 11% at Nick at Nite, in their respective key demos, marking the strongest ratings growth we've seen from Nick in 2 years. We're achieving ratings growth and revenue improvement through increased investment in content. We continue to invest in new original programming, diversified creative formats and marquee and emerging talent, both on and behind our screens.","Even as we invested in on-air programming, Nickelodeon took the leading edge of a sweeping effort across Viacom to reinvent how we deliver content and connect with fans. In March, Nickelodeon launched the Nick app for the iPad, the first of several dynamic apps to come from our individual brands. Nick app will debut for the iPhone later this quarter. And a number of our other brands will launch standalone apps this summer.","In our Filmed Entertainment segment, Paramount expanded another strong film franchise with the successful launch of G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Not only did the film perform well at the global box office, it also provided another successful example of how the studio is creative, nimble and opportunistic in optimizing release timing and formats in order to maximize profits.","Tom and Wade will detail the results in a moment, but let me quickly recap Viacom's financial performance for the March quarter. Revenues declined 6% to $3.135 billion, operating income decreased 9% to $847 million and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom declined to $481 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.96 per diluted share.","We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and we again repurchased $700 million of stock in the quarter under our $10 billion share repurchase program. We expect to repurchase an additional $700 million of stock in the current quarter as well. Given our operating performance and cash flow expectations, we now expect to repurchase a total of $2.8 billion of stock this fiscal year. Since we initiated the program in October 2010, we've repurchased close to $7 billion of our stock at an average price of under $48 per share. In our board meeting later this month, we will also review our dividend rate, as we usually do around this time of the year.","Our Media Networks segment had a solid quarter, with revenue up 2%. Advertising revenue also grew 2%, thanks to ratings improvement at our networks and strong demand. Growth represents an 8-point sequential improvement from the December quarter. We expect to achieve further sequential improvement in advertising revenue growth in the current quarter.","Affiliate revenue grew 2% in the quarter. Similar to the previous quarter, our core domestic affiliate revenue grew in the low-double-digit range, but the overall affiliate line was moderated by the timing of content availability for digital distribution partners in the quarter. We expect total domestic affiliate growth of 10% for the full fiscal year. We are in constructive discussions with several parties, including Netflix, concerning digital distribution of various portions of our rich portfolio of content beyond the expiration of our Netflix agreement later this month. We continue to see such distribution to be a growing and complementary avenue for our affiliate business.","As I said earlier, our strategy is strong, sustained investment in original, wholly-owned content. We firmly believe that if we fuel the creative engines that drive our brands, we will continue to create hits that resonate with diverse audiences, keep audiences deeply engaged with our networks and increase viewership on new and emerging platforms as well as drive value for our marketing and distribution partners.","While we invest in programming, we're also investing in the future of content itself. We believe that apps are a critical piece of that future. The recently-launched Nick app is the first of several brand apps we're rolling out this year. Our guiding principle is that the app opportunity is greater than just online video. Apps give us the opportunity to deliver a total brand experience to fans. The Nick app, for example, is an interactive playground that offers not only short-form and full-episode video but also a rich offering of games, media and other features that allow fans to connect with Nick stars in the network's new Nick Studio 10 afternoon block of live programming. And advertisers are taking notice, with several studio clients on-board at launch and other marketers poised to join.","MTV is taking a similar approach with its forthcoming app which will feature its hit programming but also deep social TV integrations and original video content. And beyond the core brand apps, we continue to launch apps for individual franchises, like The Colbert Report and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, extending the engagement that many of our shows have built with fans beyond traditional TV.","Additionally, our core brand apps drive value for our distribution partnerships and reinforce the subscription model through TV Everywhere functionality. Our authenticated apps and websites are currently available to more than 50 million pay TV subscribers with distributors including DIRECTV, Time Warner Cable, Verizon FiOS, AT&T U-verse and more.","Moving into programming highlights, I'm going to focus on 3 of our networks.","Things are going very well at Nickelodeon. The network had a great quarter in which its ratings built each month, finishing March up 21% year-over-year on its way to a 7% overall ratings gain among kids 2 to 11 for the quarter. A highlight was the 2013 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, which grew ratings over last year in the U.S. and continued its expansion into a true global franchise, with ratings up double digits in markets including the U.K., Brazil and Spain. In the current quarter so far, ratings at Nick are up 9%. We are gratified by the progress the network has made and the creative and strategic execution its team has undertaken to get back on top.","Nickelodeon has now completed the process of consolidating its West Coast development hub, allowing for greater consistency of creative vision and sharing of talent and resources across its programming teams. Throughout this quarter and beyond, Nick will bring a significant amount of new programming to the air, giving it ample time to establish new hits in advance of the critical holiday season for marketers.","Nickelodeon also continues to be strategic in maintaining demographic balance in its audience. The Kids' Choice Awards are a great example. After seeing an exodus of boys among the viewership of last year's show, the network loaded the 2013 show with talent having greater appeal for young boys, including host and Transformers star Josh Duhamel. As a result, ratings were up 19% with boys 2 to 11, the key driver of the show's overall ratings growth.","Nickelodeon rebounded with preschool audiences in the March quarter, thanks in part to the successful launch of Peter Rabbit, and continues to invest in preschool content. The network is also sharpening its focus on older girls, particularly with the upcoming launch of Sam and Cat in June, starring iCarly's Jennette McCurdy and Victorious' Ariana Grande.","Finally, animation remains a key focus for Nickelodeon. We're bringing more animated programming to the screen, including the new hit Monsters vs. Aliens; our newest series Sanjay and Craig launching later this month; the upcoming Rabbids and Breadwinners; and new episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Legend of Korra and SpongeBob.","At MTV, the network continues to earn its reputation as the cultural home of the millennial generation. Connecting with millennials means staying a step ahead of them, and the network continues to accelerate its development timelines to accommodate an audience that constantly demands fresh, original content. That means shorter windows between seasons of the network's biggest hits. Season 2 of Catfish, for example, will debut in June. Awkward just successfully debuted a new season and will return with another season in the fall. And Teen Wolf will return with a summer run beginning in June before debuting another new season early in 2014.","MTV rounds out its schedule with highly-repeatable shows like Ridiculousness and True Life that generate great ratings relative to their low cost. Girl Code is a new series in that mold that is performing well and strengthening MTV's Tuesday night female block. Efficient shows like this allow us to place expanded orders of our big hits and bring more new originals to air without dramatically growing our programming spend.","In the March quarter, hits Catfish and Teen Mom 2 continued to perform very well and the network also once again showed its ability to mine great stories from vibrant subcultures. In April, the network scored a solid hit with the 2013 MTV Movie Awards, which increased ratings 22% over last year. MTV shrewdly moved the show from June to April this year to take advantage of the additional advertising dollars in the market ahead of the summer blockbuster season and to steer clear of the NBA Playoffs.","Moving forward, MTV continues to bring more and more original programming to air to create a balanced weekly schedule for audiences and advertisers. In fiscal 2013, the network is bringing 17 new series and 15 returning series to air.","Currently, we're in a pivotal time in the network's development year. Last week, MTV unveiled upcoming programming to advertisers at its annual upfront presentation in New York. In July, the network will hold its summer pilot screening, the first pilot screening that will entirely reflect projects brought to MTV by its new development team.","Turning to BET. The network is launching an exciting new initiative around the BET Awards this summer to bring its brand to life, live and in person for its audiences. BET Experience will take over Downtown Los Angeles for 3 days in late June with an ambitious lineup that includes the debut of Beyonc\u00e9's world tour at the STAPLES Center, along with a host of musical performances by acts including R. Kelly and Miguel, a festival of BET-produced films, panel discussions on issues affecting the BET audience and a massive outdoor festival. The BET Experience marks the first time that AEG has activated all of its Downtown Los Angeles facilities at once. And the events will fuel 16 hours of live on-air and online programming for the network. Ticket sales for the BET Experience are already outpacing our projections. It's a big undertaking with a solid business rationale.","BET has been consistently successful in commanding healthy spending from advertisers seeking to reach African-American audiences. But a live event like the BET Experience allows the network to access different marketing budgets and sell unique sponsorships. The BET Experience has already locked up several blue-chip advertisers.","Finally, let's move on to our Filmed Entertainment segment. Although revenues from our theatrical releases in the March quarter exceeded those of the comparable quarter in 2012, revenue declined 20% due to lower carryover revenues in the quarter, compared to the carryover revenues from Mission: Impossible last year. But the big story was the successful premiere of G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which is a great example of Paramount's flexible approach to release scheduling in order to maximize profit. G.I. Joe was initially slated for release in June 2012, but the studio made the call to move the film to March 2013 to avoid an overcrowded summer tentpole season, allow for a conversion to 3D and improve its chances for distribution in China. Additional 3D revenue helped drive the film's stellar worldwide box office of nearly $350 million to date, including nearly $50 million in China, increasing its strong international haul.","In the current quarter, Pain & Gain kicked off Paramount's summer slate at #1, to be followed by the release of Star Trek Into Darkness later this month and World War Z in June. And Paramount continues to drive value for Viacom beyond the big screen. We recently marked the 1-year anniversary of the Paramount Channel in Spain, which continues to grow ratings and set the stage for the launch of Paramount Channels in additional international markets this year. Paramount also announced plans to return to television production, with its first project to be a potential Beverly Hills Cop series, in partnership with Sony TV.","Paramount has a rich library of film franchises to mine for television, as well as the capacity to develop original television productions, and we see a great opportunity here.","To wrap up. We will seek to build on our ratings and revenue improvement by investing in more original content. We're returning hit shows to air in faster cycles and bringing new shows to our screens in greater numbers. And we'll continue to be aggressive in unlocking further value for our shows through multiplatform viewers. We are looking to the future by evolving the brand experience through apps. Our principal revenue streams are now growing in tandem at a healthy pace. As we grow our business and our content offering across screens, we remain committed to delivering value and returning capital to our shareholders.","Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our March quarter are available on our website.","Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 2% compared with the prior year, with domestic revenues up 3% and international revenues down 4%. Foreign exchange had a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. The increase in revenues in the quarter was principally driven by increases in advertising and affiliate revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.","Domestic advertising revenues were up 2% in the quarter and international advertising revenues were up 1%. The improvement in international advertising was driven by strength in the U.K., partially offset by softness in parts of continental Europe.","In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 3%, while international revenues were down 4%. Excluding the impact from the timing of a product available under digital distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew low double digits. International revenues were down due to lower digital distribution revenue related to the timing of product availability, which was partially offset by growth in revenues from new channel launches, as well as rate and subscriber increases.","Expenses increased 5% in the quarter. Within expenses, programming expense grew 8% while SG&A expense was up 1%. Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 2%. And the adjusted operating income margin was 39%, down approximately 170 basis points compared with the prior year. The margin decline was driven by a 5% increase in expenses, partially offset by the top line growth of 2%.","Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues declined 20% in the quarter principally due to lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.","Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 15% primarily due to lower carryover revenues as a result of last year's December quarter release of Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol. This was partially offset by higher revenues from the current quarter's releases of Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 38%, reflecting lower revenues from both the current quarter releases as well as from carryover titles. These declines are primarily due to fewer titles in the current year, as compared with the prior year.","Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $65 million in the quarter, as compared to $115 million last quarter. The results principally reflect lower theatrical profits, partially offset by savings from lower overhead costs.","Now touching on corporate. Expenses increased $9 million in the quarter. The increase relates to higher deferred compensation costs as a result of the appreciation in our stock price. Excluding the deferred compensation costs, corporate expenses were flat in the quarter.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thanks, Wade. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors that are impacting the remainder of our 2013 fiscal year.","In the quarter, we generated $700 million in operating free cash flow compared to $869 million last year. We continued to maximize our free cash flow efficiency, converting over 80% of operating income into cash flow in the quarter. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to an unfavorable working capital variance and lower operating income, partially offset by lower cash taxes. The unfavorable working capital variance was principally impacted by the timing and mix of theatrical and home video receipts, which last year included Mission: Impossible IV.","Now turning to our debt. For the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. During the quarter, we issued $300 million of 3.25% senior notes due in 2023 and $250 million of 4.875% senior debentures due in 2043.","Given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have been able to access the capital markets, secure long-term funding at very attractive rates. Over the past couple of years, we have issued approximately $5 billion of public debt at an average rate of 3.6% with an average maturity of approximately 16 years. Additionally, we either called or tendered for approximately $2 billion of previously-outstanding notes. These transactions, taken together, have lowered our overall average cost of debt by approximately 150 basis points.","In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at the quarter end.","As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of debt in capital leases outstanding and $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalent. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.4x. At March 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.","Our commitment to return capital to shareholders continued in the March quarter as we returned a total of $700 million of capital back to our shareholders. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the June quarter, which means that in the first 9 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders through our share buyback and dividend programs. Since starting the current share buyback and dividend program in September 2010, we have returned over $8 billion to our shareholders, and over 75% of that return was from excess cash flows from operations.","Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our 2013 fiscal year. For fiscal 2013, we anticipate affiliate revenue growth of 10%. However, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to some of our digital agreements which are tied to product availability. For the full year, we continue to expect high-single-digit growth rates for Media Networks' programming expense. Given the timing of shows coming on the air, growth is weighted to the first half of the year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.","At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about our upcoming summer tentpole releases, including Star Trek and World War Z. We expect growth in profits to be weighted to the September quarter as the studio benefits from the carryover performance of our summer tentpoles as well as the availability of titles in home entertainment marketplace.","For 2013, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic-versus-international profitability mix.","In terms of cash taxes. Due to the retroactive reenactment of provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense, we now anticipate that cash taxes will be significantly lower than book taxes for fiscal 2013. Accordingly, we will see strong growth in free cash flow for the year.","As for our stock buyback program, as Philippe mentioned, we now expect to repurchase $2.8 billion for fiscal 2013.","To wrap up, our increased investment in original programming has started to yield results in both terms of ratings and our ad sales performance. We are also investing in our organization and our infrastructure in order to engage and monetize our audiences as they increasingly embrace consumption of our content on digital platforms. And we continue to drive efficiencies throughout our company in order to enhance our margins. The current attractive capital market interest rate environment has enabled us to lower our average cost of debt while, at the same time, extend our average maturity.","In addition, our continued focus on organic investment in driving operating efficiencies throughout our organization has contributed to strong free cash flow generation. These factors have enabled us to consistently and aggressively return capital back to our shareholders, which we believe will drive value now and into the future.","Now we'll turn the call over to your questions.","James Bombassei","Operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brian Wieser.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I was wondering, what metrics are you selling marketing partnerships on when it comes to your apps? It's -- I guess you're going to bring this out before, I guess, some of the more advanced say Nielson [ph] ratings are going to be more widely being used. And separately, I guess I have a tax question. I was just wondering, which retroactive adjustments is it that are being applied? And wondering if you could dimensionalize it and whether you think it's going to be an ongoing benefit.","Philippe P. Dauman","As far as the marketing with apps, we'll -- marketers love to have multiplatform engagement with our consumers. So it just expands our offering, creates some opportunities. There's -- the apps have additional content, both video and games, and other opportunities to highlight our marketers' initiatives. So it's just continuing our deeper engagement on the consumer side and bringing up our marketing partners with us into that deeper engagement. As far as the tax question...","Thomas E. Dooley","From the tax point of view, Brian, given that it's a retroactive tax adjustment, it will have a benefit to us that we hadn't been forecasting of around $400 million. So it's a significant benefit but it's a catch-up for almost 2 years of not having that benefit in place. Once it's caught up, the benefit goes away.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A couple for Philippe, on Netflix. Philippe, I wanted to hear from you, how would you characterize the inability to not renew or extend the deal with Netflix? Was it a change of philosophy on your side? Was it simply price? And then how confident are you of your ability to find money out there to replace that hole? And could it -- might be coming from people that we haven't seen show up yet? So that's where we are.","Philippe P. Dauman","Michael, as I indicated in my remarks, we're still in discussions with Netflix. Remember, our deal does not expire until later this month. So we are in discussions. They -- with them and with others. Obviously, we don't want to announce specifics until we have new dealer deals to reveal to you. As Netflix indicated in its call last week, it has interest in different kinds of content, some exclusive. We're open to licensing content, some of it on an exclusive basis, some of it on a nonexclusive basis, and with a view to -- overall to maximizing our revenues. We continue to see the digital distribution arena as a growing opportunity and one that will be complementary to what we do. And it's just growing the pie over time. Now from a -- because of -- the kind of recognition, it appears choppy, but when we look at it overall, a full year basis, we have enough visibility to tell you that we are going to meet our 10% growth in affiliate revenue forecast that we've given to you in previous quarters.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on that a little bit, Philippe, not so much the -- whether you're going to increase SVOD revenue, but what's the right long-term strategy for selling programming, with Netflix wanting more exclusive program sales? But I imagine you have a desire to foster competition in the SVOD sector. Are you going to be open to doing exclusive program sales knowing that it could hurt other SVOD players? Or do you have a desire to only do nonexclusive sales?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, again, there -- as you point out, there is increasing competition in that distribution arena. And we are doing business with several players today. We have content up on Amazon, on Hulu. There are discussions going -- that are taking place with others. And by the way, this is a global phenomenon, and there are other players in individual countries that are emerging. We have -- we are fortunate enough that we own a lot of compelling content. We have deep libraries with many thousands of titles. So we look at what our distribution partners are looking for. Their strategies are different, their strategies evolve. And we'll work with them to help them improve their business in a way that's consistent with maximizing our relationships with all distributors, not just the SVOD but our long-term affiliates and others. So we balance our different considerations. We look at what's good for our brands. There's a lot of marketing value to some of the content that we have in the SVOD arena, particularly with shows that have more seasons to come. So there are a number of factors. And we work with all of our partners in all aspects of distribution to come up with win-win situations.","Operator","And we'll take our next questions from Richard Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. When you look at Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you launched it last year, and I think there was, I think, among investors, a little bit of skepticism in your ability to reboot this franchise. And it seems like it's done pretty well in the network. And I -- it's like you're -- on iPad, you're like the #1 paid app. And I'm just kind of curious, why do you think this franchise has resonated so well? And what do you do from here to keep building its brand and making more out of it as you look out over the next couple of years?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, Richard, thanks for bringing it up. We couldn't be happier with the way this franchise has been rebooted. And it has a long life ahead of it. The -- you have a lot of young dads who remember the old series fondly. And the execution on the new animated series on Nickelodeon is really great. It's visually beautiful, and it echoes the prior series but it's an improvement on it. And it resonates on a global basis. It's driving our consumer products business. Our -- in a difficult general environment, our ancillary revenues have grown in the past quarter, and that's really driven by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. And a lot more opportunity there. And I'm really excited about the Paramount film that is -- has just started production, with Michael Bay as the producer. And when that gets released next year, that will be yet another step forward in building that franchise again on a global basis. And it just -- it works on our -- on all of our platforms and it will just add an important new leg on the stool of our consumer products business and reinforce our other properties, by the way.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And just a follow-up with Tom on the leverage. Your leverage, I think, you said is down to 2.4x. It sounds like, from your commentary in terms of the pickup in distribution fees and accelerating ad sales, that you're going to end up with far more rapid growth in EBITDA in the back half of the fiscal year and into '13 -- and I'm sorry, into '14, and just at what point do you start to get more comfortable to move your leverage target up a little bit? Because it just seems like you're generating a good amount of cash and growth is accelerating and you're ending up kind of deleveraging.","Thomas E. Dooley","Rich, we continue to kind of target, like, 2 to 2.25 leverage ratio. We'll continue to do that for the foreseeable future. We think the strong cash flow that we generate as a company and the excess free cash flow that we talked about, over $8 billion dollar return in a little over 3 years is pretty impressive. If you go back to when we started this, it's over -- almost 25% to 30% of the market cap at that point in time. So we think that model serves us well and provides us with greater access to capital markets.","Wade Davis","Why not stick at that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just circling back on your comments about the advertising outlook and expecting ad revenue growth to accelerate in the third quarter. I guess, are the drivers behind that really just the very strong improvement you're seeing in ratings? Or are you also seeing some, I guess, pick-up or acceleration in the underlying advertising market? I guess any comments on scatter you could provide would be helpful.","Philippe P. Dauman","We have -- certainly, a driver of the improvement is correlated to improving our ratings, but we are also seeing strong demand. Particularly if you look at our mix, we're seeing a better mix of advertising demand. So we've really made great strides in categories like autos, retail, quick-service restaurants, beverages, computer, hardware and software, but we're seeing strength in important categories to add to our traditional areas of strength that's been there. Then pricing is very strong. We're seeing -- in the last quarter, we had -- upfront-to-upfront pricing was up in the mid-single-digit area. Scatter-over-upfront, on average, for our networks was up about 20%. And if you look at scatter-over-scatter, that was up in the low double digits last quarter. So there's good demand, and we're feeling very good with the combination of our better performance, particularly the Nickelodeon family; and the general environment, which is positive. And that also bodes well for the upfront that we are entering into.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just a follow-up on Nick At Nite where we've seen some improvements there. Is that just from a better lead-in from Nick? Or are you also feeling the programming there is where you want it to be?","Philippe P. Dauman","It's both. It's a good lead-in from Nickelodeon delivering a better audience. And we are seeing strength in Friends, for example, which has built up. And we're combining -- from an advertiser perspective, combining strong third-party content with our original content, it just provides an attractive mix for them. So it's a good story, and it's one that we worked hard on over the last several quarters and it's coming to fruition.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Eric Katz, on for Marci. I was just wondering if you can comment on the tone or strength of the Nickelodeon upfront that recently took place?","Philippe P. Dauman","We had wonderful reaction at our presentation. I talked to a lot of advertisers. It was exceptionally well-attended. And they're very pleased with the progress Nickelodeon has made where we've already sold about 1\/3 of our upfront inventory. And obviously, it's very early in the upfront season. So Nickelodeon should have a very healthy upfront this year.","Eric Katz - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And could you also comment on -- it seems like you're investing in originals in networks such as SPIKE now. Which networks other than Nick and MTV do you see the most upside and likely to see the most investment going forward?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we are -- you're right to point out, SPIKE went from having very little in the way of original content. We have -- we went into the reality genre, with some success with shows like Ink Master and Tattoo Nightmares -- by the way, those shows also improved the gender balance on SPIKE. They're very close to even between men and women. And Bar Rescue, a lot of these shows are, again, shows that our advertisers like. And we are going to also go into the scripted business on SPIKE. So that's a network we're going to build. COMEDY CENTRAL continues to do well. We're increasing the number of shows. We debuted another show last night, Inside Amy Schumer, and there'll be more shows to come there. CMT is starting to show signs of improvement, as we have increased our investment in original programming there with Dog and Beth, and other programming. So we think there's a big opportunity in some of those networks, particularly those like some of the ones I just mentioned, TV Land included, which capture more share in demos where we not -- we have not had traditionally a big market share. So this is an incremental opportunity for us and one that we want to invest in. BET is another example of a network where we have increased our investment in original programming, and that's improved the health of that network.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Janedis of UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A little bit more on kids, maybe more broadly. Can you give us an update on the kids market overall? Is this year's upfront healthier? And to what extent can you monetize the ratings in Nick ahead of the new upfront pricing?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, as I said in response to a couple of questions ago, the kids upfront marketplace is shaping up well for us. Our marketers need to be on our Nickelodeon networks. And so they've been working very closely with us, they're rooting for us. And they're very gratified, as I am, by the new programming that's already on air and that's coming. So the -- really important is the holiday season coming up. We're seeing -- apart from the toy category, we're also seeing a lot of new video game launches, both on platform and games themselves, as we get into that holiday season. And we are growing our non-endemic business, such as automotive. Nickelodeon is a part of the house where automotive business has been growing, and other categories. And we're able to capture more adult dollars as marketers are realizing that there are a lot of moms and dads watching our Nickelodeon networks.","Thomas E. Dooley","Our aim to monetize in the marketplace. While a large percentage of Nickelodeon's inventory is sold in the upfront, much more so than our other networks, because of the liability bank, we had the turnaround in ratings, was able to be monetized by using the liability bank that we had in place. So the upside in ratings does that come back to us through that.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, maybe one other quick one. You've talked about owning more of your content at your networks. I assume that means you'll be buying less content in syndication. Has there been any change in pricing for syndicated content?","Philippe P. Dauman","So we're certainly being selective. We are -- we continue to buy third-party content. It's really a shift in emphasis. And so in terms of what we're buying, we're seeing some improvement in pricing, but again...","Thomas E. Dooley","Pricing and terms.","Philippe P. Dauman","What's that?","Thomas E. Dooley","Pricing and terms, overall terms.","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, pricing and, as Tom points out, overall terms are improving. But look, the important trend is shifting dollars from acquired programming to original programming, not taking away all acquired programming -- we do rely on that, including some of the great film libraries out there, like Paramount. Those continue to play well across all networks, which bodes well for Paramount. But original programming just works better for our brands generally.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I was curious a little bit about the equity in JV, which I know in this quarter was relatively small, but it's interesting. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what are the trends at EPIX and in the India JV? And do you know much we should make as kind of the year-over-year improvement there?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, EPIX continues to perform very solidly. Well, I think you can expect EPIX's bottom line to grow over time as existing distribution revenues grow with lot of stability in -- on the programming cost side, generally speaking, with more distribution coming onstream over the years. So EPIX will -- should be a growing story for us and our partners. India continues to be a great building opportunity, long-term opportunity. We think it's a really strong market. We have a strong position. Along with our partner in India, we will continue to invest to launch new channels and to take advantage of the opportunity to build scale as the revenues improve there. So again, in terms of value, India will improve. We are adding to the growing portfolio of national networks within India. We're looking at regional networks to serve different communities within India. And the bottom line over time should increase once we've established our scale position in India.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could follow up on the premium network market. There has been something of a change there in the environment, with Starz being spun out as a separate company, a lot of discussion now about the possibility for merger and acquisition activity in that area. I was wondering if you could comment kind of generally what you see as the competitive dynamics there and the need or lack thereof of more consolidation.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we certainly don't see any need for consolidation on our part. We created -- we have a service owned directly by -- by 3 studios. And it's a very good, strong partnership. We -- it's a -- EPIX is, of course, associated with our basic cable networks, which give us some ballast and strength in the distribution arena. So yes, we're going to keep growing EPIX, the profitability will increase. And we can do that in the existing competitive environment. So I can't speak for what is going to happen with Starz, but our focus is on organically growing EPIX.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions are ad-related. The first one is just a follow-up on the very first question. As you roll out the apps, how do you view the optimal monetization of the premium video advertising within those apps? Do you think that OCR and a demo-based measurement is the kind of the optimal path to monetization? Or do you think, over time, you'll seek to take more advantage of traditional sort of ad targeting? And how do you see that developing over the next couple of years? The second question is, if you look at MTV ratings kind of \"post the conclusion of season 5 of the Jersey Shore\" comps, on March 15, can you talk about how ratings have behaved at MTV since the middle of March through the end of April versus the rest of the first quarter? And lastly, the sequential acceleration in the current quarter versus the prior one, would we still be seeing that or still have that expectation if it wasn't for the movement of the BET Awards from the end of June versus the beginning of July?","Philippe P. Dauman","David, as far as the apps go, which obviously are just being launched, right now, we are using them to provide incremental marketing opportunities to some of our key advertisers, studios notably, like the ability to broaden their marketing offering with us. You mentioned OCR: There are a lot of issues right now with the -- Nielsen's OCR measure that they're testing. Again, there are some sample issues, a lot of things to be worked out there. So right now, we're -- we -- there are other ways to measure that kind of viewership and monetizing that and, over the longer term, targeting, and particularly with our networks, our ability to see where the content is delivered. Our own information is a valuable tool for advertising partners. And we are engaged in a lot of good conversation, particularly with our major advertisers. And that will be a growing trend over time. As far as MTV's ratings, we -- we're again -- as I mentioned in the last earnings call, we have a better balance across the week than we did when we were so reliant on the Jersey Shore ratings. So that's giving us a better lineup for our advertisers. And we've seen good year-over-year stability at MTV's ratings over the last several weeks, and we expect to have a good ratings performance and better balance for -- as we go forward. And then I think your last point was on the acceleration and the BET Awards. There are a number of -- that's -- overall, that's not really the factor. We also had -- at the beginning of the quarter, there was actually unfavorable comparison in terms of the Easter timing. So when you balance all that out, it's -- there's really not much of an impact, and really the acceleration is more a reflection of both ratings performance and market strength and, thirdly, a better mix as it relates to our own networks. I think I covered all your questions, right?","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I think you did.","Operator","And we'll take our next questions from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just following on, on digital advertising, I'm wondering if you could comment on trends within your domestic advertising numbers on digital as a percentage of the total? Is it accelerating? And then just to follow up on the last question, which I thought that was a good one, about audience targeting. I mean, Philippe, you talked about your conversations with marketers. Do you think it's likely, and are they starting to embrace audience data in the way that you described? And as the online TV market, I guess, becomes more data driven, as opposed to, as we know historically, it's been reach-driven, it's been content-driven. Do you think that, that audience data, the multivariable data about viewers, is becoming more valuable? Or do you think it's maybe just not as valuable outside of content adjacency? I know you have the data, you see the data, so wondering if -- to what degree you'll be able to use that as a competitive advantage in your conversations with customers?","Philippe P. Dauman","The most important aspect is that we -- yes, we've been under-measured. We -- Our audiences are watching our content in different arenas. The existing third-party measurements data is currently not capturing the viewership that's out there. As we go more into a TV Everywhere environment where people will be -- will have the ability to watch our content on their different devices, both inside and outside the home, that will become increasingly important. And I think the marketing community and the content community are working increasingly directly together to figure out how to work to better measure and target the audiences. Remember that our networks are very targeted to begin with. So it's -- they know who they're reaching, but we can start getting into more data, to more granular data to help that. As far as digital advertising, again, it's becoming more and more a part of the multiplatform package. Clearly, video advertising is a stronger category than the industry broadly. And display advertising, which -- where the trend is down overall, and you're seeing that across many of the technology companies, as well as the media companies. So that's definitely a trend.","Thomas E. Dooley","Well, Anthony, as you know, the digital inventory is very valuable, especially if it's associated with high-value brands and you can never get enough of that. This week the new fronts are going on, and a majority of the new fronts are being conducted with very -- under very different currencies. The currencies that Google uses, the currencies that Facebook uses, the currency that Hulu uses is a very different currency than the rest of the advertising marketplace. And it's a very fast-growing aspect of our business and one we're paying a lot of attention to and hope to participate in with our inventory because we believe we'll have valuable and good quantities of that inventory in the not-too-distant future.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Creutz with Cowen.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","To kind of follow on this theme, as we have sort of this convergence of better ability to deliver content to audiences on multiple devices, better ability to measure the audiences and then better ability to deliver ads that are relevant for advertisers, is there a point where your willingness to sell content to OTT providers where you don't have the ability to advertise gets less so that your reservation weights for your content goes up because you're better and better able to monetize advertising through your on-demand content?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, again, they're not mutually exclusive. Hulu Plus, obviously, does carry advertising. There are different models out there. There are future-emerging distributors that similarly have models that have advertising associated with it, and we're exploring those. We'll have the ability to evaluate the best way for us to maximize our -- both our brand and our economic situation. And as the world evolves, we will evolve our own strategy, as is happening on the distribution side. Today, we find the deals that we have done to be incremental for us. We've been able to monetize previously-not-monetizeable deep library in a way that's incremental net-net. And we will only do business if we think it will short-term and long-term improve our business. So yes, each situation needs to be evaluated on its own.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tony Wible with Janney.","Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about programming cost, both in film and TV. As you see more of these over-the-top players getting into originals and, as you alluded to, moving more towards originals, and a lot of the other traditional TV networks moving to originals, how do you expect that playing out in programming cost inflation longer term?","Philippe P. Dauman","I actually don't think it's -- creating great content is one of the hardest things to do in the overall marketplace. We have a long history of doing it, and we'll continue to do so. So it's not about the cost, it's about finding the right creative talent, putting it together. And we produce a variety of content on television, some of it low cost, some of it high cost. Scripted is generally more expensive than reality. I talked about some of our content being very efficient and repeatable. So it's getting the right mix to support the brand. On the movie side, the big movies such as Star Trek and World War Z coming out, they obviously have a big budget, as those films tend to have, but very often, they're lower risk than some of the lower budget. I'm not too worried about the performance of our strong franchises. It's just a question of how well they will do. And then you -- again, you balance that with less-expensive releases like Paranormal Activity, which is a very profitable franchise for us. So the way we manage on the film side is to -- we have not been increasing our net spend on the studio side. The studio has been a capital provider to us, and it's more about finding the quality than it is to throw a lot of dollars at it.","James Bombassei","Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Jim Bombassei.","Jim Bombassei","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our June quarter earnings call.","Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. We also have an accompanying slide presentation that you can follow, along with our remarks. I want to refer you to the slide number one in the presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail on our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","Before we begin, I want to note that the purpose of today\u2019s call is to discuss our third quarter results and performance. And we will not be responding to questions or comments regarding potential M&A. now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bakish","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you again for joining us. During the quarter, Viacom delivered strong execution and made progress on our evolution as investments helped drive our transformation and top-line growth. We have a lot to be proud of this quarter.","I'm particularly pleased with the return to growth we reported in domestic ad sales as well as our strong upfront results which sell us sub-well for next year. We also continue to see great traction from the rapid integration and scale in the Pluto TV and are pleased to see International Media Networks return to growth on a constant currency basis.","I\u2019ll update you on these areas in detail in a moment. But first, a brief overview of the financials and some key operating highlights from the quarter.","From a financial perspective, the main point here is that we have been promising a return to growth for Viacom and this quarter we have accomplished just that.","On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 6%. Domestic ad revenue grew 6%. Total International Media Networks revenue grew 7% and while adjusted OI was flat, adjusted diluted EPS grew 3% marking a sixth consecutive quarter of growth and year-to-date free cash flow up $984 million is up 10% compared to prior year period.","Moving to operating highlights, I'm going to start with Paramount. We are thrilled with what\u2019s going on at Paramount, which just delivered its 10th straight quarter of year-over-year adjusted OI improvement and on-track full year profitability in 2019.","At the box office, Elton John\u2019s musical biopic Rocketman was a global success generating over $185 million and counting. Currently in theaters is Crawl, a summary thriller that received great reviews and will be a profitable film for the studio creating a very substantial return on $16 million cost.","And tomorrow, Dora and the Lost City of Gold premiers which is a live action film from Nickelodeon's Dora the Explorer franchise. This co-branded film is a great example of how we're using our iconic IP to rekindle interest in beloved franchises and drive engagement at the theater, the network and at retail through consumer products.","Looking ahead, we're very excited about Paramount's 2020 slate. We have a wild new sci-fi action film starring Will Smith called Gemini Man coming in October. Then we have first of three Terminator movies coming with Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger back in action. And next summer, we have a Top Gun sequel that looks incredible, one that audiences are clearly excited about.","When the trailer dropped in July, it had nearly 10 million views on YouTube within the first 24 hours and these are just three of the 16 films we have scheduled. So, the fiscal 20 slate is a big step forward and one we are extremely excited about.","On the on the TV side, Paramount also continue to fire on all cylinders. Paramount television picked up seven Emmy nominations and continues to deliver hits like Catch-22, which premiered on Hulu in the quarter and 13 Reasons Why which comes out with its third season on Netflix later this year.","In all, Paramount TV now has 26 shows order two or in production including the sequel series to TMT's The Alienist, the adaption of the international bestseller Chate Rom [ph] for Apple and two series for Warner Media's upcoming streaming service, among others.","And production continues to ramp up at our other studios to. For example, Awesomeness had a busy quarter with the releases of the Perfect Date and Trinkets on Netflix and the season two debut of Hulu's Light as A Feather in July.","We also announced that Viacom International studios and Paramount television are developing an adaption of the Telefe hit series 100 Days to Fall in Love for Showtime. This is another great example of how are leveraging our IP and illustrates Telefe's growing global influence in making Viacom an even larger production force.","So, there is a ton of great stuff happening on the studio side and we're excited for more to come. Continuing in international, against the challenging macroeconomic environment, I'm proud to say that on a constant currency basis, we delivered strong quarterly results and return to growth.","Rating share of Telefe and Channel 5 were up nicely and as were Comedy Central and Paramount Network International. And we continue to launch new premium and international products.","During the quarter, we launched seven premium VOD offerings including Paramount Plus with Net Brazil and two launches Noggin in Latin America bringing the live total to 46. So, we're getting some scale there. And in mobile we closed six deals including two Noggin deals bring us to a total of 32 international mobile subscription partnerships.","Turning to domestic audience performance, in the quarter, Viacom maintained the number one share of U.S. basic cable viewing among key demos, including kids, teens, 18 to 34, 2 to 49 and African Americans. And we had more top 20 original cable series than any other cable family.","Overall, our portfolio of networks grew share 1% year-over-year with strong results of Comedy Central and Paramount Network, in particular. In fact, Comedy Central notched its ninth consecutive quarter of share growth, while Paramount network enjoys third straight quarter of growth.","Our networks are performing because even in an increasingly crowded content landscape we're producing hits. His like Yellow Stone who season two debuts on Paramount Network makes it the most-watched series on cable this summer. Hits like The Hills on MTV which is the number one new reality series for persons 18 to 49 and has already been renewed for a second season.","And hits like Ryan's Mystery Play Date on Nickelodeon, which after three months on air is already the number one show on TV for preschoolers. Importantly, Nickelodeon continues to execute on its turnaround. We're encouraged by the performance of new series like Are You Smarter Than 5th Grader and all that.","These shows are attracting new audiences and helping drive share gains at Nick for the first few weeks in the fourth quarter.","In addition, we saw enormous success with SpongeBob's 20th birthday live special in July and come fall, love the largest slate of new content ever across the Nickelodeon portfolio.","Also, this week, we announced plans to acquire Garfield, which marks another step and reinforcing Nickelodeon status as kids first stop for the best content and characters. We're incredibly happy to have Garfield join our growing roster of globally loved franchises, and look forward to the unique content, consumer products and experiences our teams will create, which brings me to domestic distribution.","Domestic affiliate revenue declined 1% for the quarter. Note that the quarter had some timing impacts which Wade we'll discuss in a moment.","Importantly, as we announced last week, Viacom signed a new carriage distribution deal with NCTC, which represents more than 750 member companies. With that, this management team has now renewed or extended almost all Viacom's traditional sub base.","In short, our partnership first strategy continues to resonate with distributors, as evidenced by our deals over the past three years. We have secured meaningful distribution wins, broaden industry relationships through collaborative partnerships, and extended the reach of our services.","Another key component of our distribution strategy has been the launch of targeted niche products where we think we have a unique competitive advantage in the marketplace. That's why we're so excited to announce the launch of BET plus, a joint venture with Tyler Perry, which will be a premier subscription video on demand surface focused on the African American audience when it launches later this fall.","BET plus will feature more than 1000 hours of premium content, including exclusive new original programming, and fan favorite series, movies and specials from Tyler Perry and a host of other leading African American content creators, like Will Packer, Tracy Oliver and more. It's shaping up to be a fantastic product.","Now to domestic ad sales, an area I want to spend a bit more time on and highlight how the transformation of Viacom is clearly evident in the delivery of compelling financial performance.","As I mentioned at the outset of the call, the biggest headline of the quarter is that domestic ad sales returned to growth for the first time in 20 quarters, as revenue grew 6% year over year. This represents a significant milestone for Viacom.","In fact, this quarterly performance allows us to reiterate our guidance for full year growth, and ushers in a new era of advertising growth at Viacom. I think it's fair to say that there was some skepticism in the market when we said we return to add sales growth. But we were committed to it, putting in place a differentiated strategy and working hard on execution.","And we are now beginning to see that payoff. Two years ago, we recognized that across the industry, when your inventory was declining, necessitating a meaningful shift in strategy to return ad sales to sustainable growth. This required an entirely new approach in both what solution we offered marketers and how we partnered with them.","That's why we built a sophisticated set of advanced marketing solutions. For our advertising partners to reach the demographics that are most valuable to them in new and compelling ways.","Organically, we launched Vantage, one of the most sophisticated ads targeting platforms in the industry. At the same time, we pursued key advanced marketing partnerships with MVPD providers, and helped launch open AP for better industry collaboration.","Along the way, we also made several strategic acquisitions, including Awesomeness TV, WHOSAY and Pluto TV. As a result, our AMS offerings now engage customers across linear and digital video, influencer and shopper marketing, branded content and now Pluto TV's advanced sales capabilities, and they are powerful solutions for today's marketplace.","Underscoring the efficacy of this strategy, our AMS revenue increased 84% year-over-year, and it's now a business contributing hundreds of millions of dollars. The AMS business will nearly double in fiscal 2019 representing nearly 20% of domestic ad revenue as we continue to bring new and more advanced inventory online across our growing portfolio, especially from Pluto TV.","Related to this, we're very excited about our upfront results, and how they set Viacom up for continued ad sales momentum. In the upfront we drove strong pricing with high single to double-digit growth across all our cable networks. Reflecting the improved strength of our brands and demand for the AMS portfolio, including Pluto TV.","We went in with a carefully crafted strategy to take full advantage of both the market dynamics and our unique assets, which resulted in our ability to drive price increases and capture meaningful overall volume, while preserving significant linear inventory to continue to capitalize on an extremely strong scatter market. Pluto TV was a big contributor to add sales growth from the quarter and the upfront discussions, in part, because its leadership and free streaming TV continues to grow.","When we announced the acquisition of Pluto TV in late January, it had 12 million monthly active users. As of the end of July, Pluto has 18 million monthly active users a 50% increase. We expect user growth to continue as we further expand the content offering and broaden distribution, which will also further benefit ad sales and our partners.","In fact, during the quarter, we increased Pluto TVs content offering by adding 28 new channels to the service. We also launched Pluto TV Latino, a suite of 11 free linear channels stock with 2,000 plus hours of TV programming in Spanish and Portuguese. And we are delivering on our vision of using Pluto TV as a platform to work with distributors to create incremental value in broadband, mobile and video sub basis, both through advertising and by up-sell and additional video products, including video bundles and targeted SVOD products.","In fact, Pluto TV is now integrated on Comcast flex service, and X1 set top boxes and gain new distribution on Cox Communications' Contour video and broadband platforms. These distribution relationships will also be a valuable asset when we launch BET plus this fall.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.","Wade Davis","Thanks. As Bob just discussed several quarters ago, we described the path for returning back onto long-term sustainable growth.","The third quarter results delivered on that promise with growth across all of our businesses on a constant currency basis. And we expect this momentum to continue in the September quarter.","Looking forward, I want to reiterate our prior guidance the domestic ad sales and domestic affiliate revenue will grow for the full year and Paramount will deliver solid full year profitability for the first time in 4 years.","We are also reaffirming our adjusted OI guidance of low to mid-single digit decline on a total company basis. The investments we are making an AMS and Pluto and Noggin and in BET plus as well as in our studio production business are driving the evolution of the company. These initiatives are achieving scale and are offsetting headwinds in the linear business returning Viacom to overall top-line growth for the full year.","On slide eight of our web deck we have a summary of our consolidated financial performance. For the June quarter, on a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 6% and adjusted diluted EPS grew 3% marketing our six-consecutive quarter of adjusted diluted EPS growth. In addition to the P&L strengths year-to-date free cash flow of $984 million is up 10% versus a year ago.","Moving on to the segment results on slide 9 I'll start with filmed entertainment. Paramount continues to deliver on its turnaround with strong top and bottom-line growth. Fiscal third quarter revenue grew double-digits and adjusted OI of $85 million was almost double that of the prior year. Total revenue for Paramount increased 14% driven by strong double-digit growth in licensing and home entertainment revenue, partially offset by a modest decline in theatrical revenue.","Licensing revenue is up 29% in the quarter driven by monetization of our library and growth in TV production. Home entertainment revenue increased 35% benefiting from carryover revenue associated with Bumblebee. Theatrical revenue reflected the strong performance of Rocket Man and Pet Sematary, which was more than offset by comparisons to the release of A Quiet Place in the prior year quarter.","The improvement in film entertainment profitability was largely driven by increased monetization of the library and disciplined cost management. With the strong adjusted OI performance in the quarter, Paramount is now profitable through the first nine months of the fiscal year.","Turning to Media Networks, which is on slide 10. Comments on Media Networks will be in constant currency terms. For detail on a reported result, please see our earnings release.","Worldwide Media Networks revenue returned to growth in the quarter up 3% year-over-year, driven by 7% worldwide advertising growth and 8% international affiliate growth. This is partially offset by a decrease in CPE rec and live revenue.","Adjusted operating income was down 5% in the quarter largely due to an increase in marketing current and upcoming original programming launches as well as our investments in Pluto, other D2C products and the scaling of our AMS infrastructure.","Moving to domestic ad sales, this was an impressive quarter with growth of 6% representing 800 basis points of sequential improvement versus our second quarter. This performance was driven by a combination of sequential improvement in linear business and accelerating growth in AMS which increased 84% in the quarter.","The sequential improvement in the linear business was driven by a strong scatter market improved pricing in key categories and contribution from a number of 10 programs including The BTE Awards, The MTV Movie Awards and The CMT Music Awards.","We also benefited from the timing of Easter by about a 100 basis points. In our AMS business, we continue to add addressable advertising capacity lighting up incremental inventory on both DIRECTV Now and AT&T Watch in the quarter.","Given the scale on accelerating growth of AMS, we expect it will continue to more than offset minimal headwinds driving full year domestic ad sales growth.","I want to take a moment to add some more context around Bob\u2019s earlier comments on the upfront. As he noted, we had a very successful upfront which sets us up well for continued domestic advertising growth going forward.","We went into the upfront with a differentiated strategy built around the combined power of our linear brands and our rapidly growing AMS portfolio. And the strategy worked. We achieved the highest price increases across all of our cable networks in over a decade while simultaneously capturing meaningful volume.","Our strategy positioned the breadth of our solution set including targeted TV, digital video, Pluto TV, influencer marketing, branded content, experiential and shopper marketing to complement our powerful linear brands which reached allusive younger demos.","By leveraging the rapidly growing inventory in our AMS business, we are able to reduce the amount of linear inventory we sold, focus on price and absorb overall volume and demand in AMS where we\u2019re not inventory constraint.","Having done this, we preserve significant linear inventory which will allow us to take full advantage of a historically strong scatter market as the year unfolds.","Now moving to domestic affiliate revenue, revenue declined 1% in the quarter. quarterly performance was impacted by subscriber declines including comping against the return of full distribution on charter partially offset by higher contractual rate increases, OTT, and studio production revenues.","From a timing perspective certain anticipated content licensing revenue shifted out of Q3 and into Q4 which will benefit our September quarter.","On slide 11 of the deck, we have an overview of international media networks, where revenue returned to strong top-line growth, up 7% in quarter. International ad sales grew 9% driven by viewership gains in our major markets.","In Argentina, we also benefited from the political advertising cycle and in UK, our growth was further supported by contractual ad sales partnerships and are not marketplace dependent.","Looking at ratings, Channel 5 achieved its fourth consecutive quarter from growth in viewership share. And Telefe remained the number one network in ratings for 19 straight months.","International markets outside of Argentina and the UK also saw ad growth in the quarter. International affiliate revenue increased 8% in the quarter benefiting from growth in the linear business as well as from SVOD and OTT deliveries.","Now turning back to the consolidated results and looking at items below the line. Net interest expense was lower by $19 million due to our deleveraging actions.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.1% for the full year, we now expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24%. On slide 12 is a summary of our cash flow and debt, we continue to deliver extremely strong free cash flows up 10% year-to-date, the $984 million.","The growth in free cash flow was due to an improvement in working capital management partially offset by an increase in cash taxes. Moving to the balance sheet, the quarter end we have $9 billion of gross debt outstanding, reduction of 11% versus the prior year. Our adjusted gross debt reflects in the equity credit we received from S&P and Fitch on our hybrid securities with $8.3 billion.","We plan to pay down the $220 million maturity that comes due in September as we continue to delever.","Looking at the outlook for the remainder of the year, the benefits from our strategic initiatives will continue to deliver results. We're reaffirming our outlook for full year total company revenue growth and low to mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. With growth at Media Networks and filmed entertainment, we will deliver meaningful domestic ad sales growth in the fourth quarter and consequently, see full year growth.","For fiscal 2019, AMS will represent nearly 20% of our domestic ad sales business. The scale of RMS business now compares to the advanced advertising businesses of the market leaders Hulu and Roku, which are doing incredibly well.","We're proud to say that we're right there with them. Terms of domestic affiliate revenue, we continue to expect full year growth in the low single digits as we benefit from rate escalators, virtual MVPD growth, content licensing and the scaling of our solution products.","For international media networks, we expect continued momentum in September quarter with growth and total revenue, benefiting from continued strength in Argentina, as well as significant SVOD, and OTT deliveries.","Lastly, we're also reaffirming our adjusted OI guidance of down low to mid-single digits, which is driven by the incremental investments we're making and our growth initiatives. Filmed entertainment will return to profitability for the full year for the first time since 2015. cementing the turnaround, we promised.","In wrapping up, we continue to be focused and relentless and the execution of our strategies to deliver growth. The third quarter is a great example of the progress we've made. We're excited about the opportunity going forward. These growth initiatives continue to deliver at a scale that has created an inflection point in Viacom's growth.","And now, I'd like to open it up for question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much. I just have one on Paramount and one on Media Networks, please. First on Paramount, we've seen some really impressive improvement at Paramount. It sounds like the films that were -- the new leadership that really just started in earnest about a year ago, I guess I would assume also most of the restructuring and cost cutting as well behind you.","So, I guess given all that, I guess, where are we in terms of the stages of Paramount's turnaround. Just trying to get a sense of how we can sort of assess the growth prospects ahead.","And then my second question just on the network side, how disruptive if at all, do you think the launch of Disney Plus is to your Nickelodeon platform? You know, if it makes the kids content maybe a bit more ubiquitous? Does it further the competition for your viewership?","Bob Bakish","Sure, thanks, Alexia. So, on Paramount, there is no question that the turnaround phase is behind us. And we're entering into a new phase of growth and vitality. And you really only need to look at the 2020 film slate, including titles like Gemini Man, Terminator, Dark Fate. Quiet Place 2, The SpongeBob movie, the long-awaited sequel to Top Gun among others, as well as the TV slave with 26 shows order to or in production, including 13 Reasons Why, Jack Ryan, Haunting of Hills House 2 and more to see that very clearly.","And, you know, Paramount has incredible value to Viacom, and really to the market at large. It's a home for talent. It's a global premium content producer. It's a massive library owner. It's a marketing and distribution machine.","And it's really a platform for the creation and growth of franchises, which makes it an irreplaceable partner to the creative community to the theater circuits to the networks and really all forms of distribution platforms. And that, of course, makes it a material asset to Viacom. So, these are exciting days at Paramount and really provide calm and we're feeling great about it.","On your second question on Disney plus certainly a lot of discussion on this and their pricing does look very competitive. Our view continues to be that the consumer market is segmenting by price points, from big basic to skinny bundles to SVOD to free and there will be movement across those segments both up and down. And there will be bundling benefits in some of those segments, particularly with broadband and video bundles.","Now within the segments, we think there will be choice and competition will be intense and certainly Disney will be a factor in that SVOD segment. Our strategy is to play in all the segments from big bundle to free and our evolving product lines allowing to do just that and look Nickelodeon has incredible traction in the marketplace very important to distributors, what they are seeing in terms of where it's going. So, we feel good about that in the shifting landscape.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jessica-Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America.","Jessica-Reif Ehrlich","Maybe one other one on Paramount, can you and then advertising. Has there been any impact or any expected impacts from what's going on with China at the moment and then on advertising you've made such progress with your digital initiatives is any of the scalable into the international markets, and I guess on the upfront you were great in giving us the pricing increase but you said volumes up. Can you give us a sense of how much it up? Thank you.","Bob Bakish","Yes, Jessica. Thanks. So, on Paramount and China certainly no impact to-date, we don\u2019t have any big titles well into the fall. So clearly sometime for this to get sorted out and so we'll just have to wait and see ultimately this is a high-stakes game these two countries are playing, there is lots of reason to believe it will get sorted out. But again, for now, no impact.","Wade Davis","In terms of being able to take the things that we build in the U.S. around AMS and in particular Pluto as part of AMS internationally absolutely a huge opportunity, we're just getting started with respect to that.","The Pluto integration internationally just started to touch the places that it was operating before we acquired it from Germany, Switzerland and the UK. We did integrating Pluto into the My 5, AVOD in the UK where we're seeing significant consumption of Pluto content on the My 5 platform and we have very ambitious set of international rollout plans going forward we're investing in the infrastructure necessary for smooth aggressive roll out in traditional territory in, you will see us roll out across of Latin America and between 20 and 23. We're going to rolling out in 19 territories around the world. So big opportunity for us internationally.","Bob Bakish","Volume in the upfront.","Wade Davis","Terms of volume in the upfront sorry. So, volume in the upfront we were able to capture significant volume in the upfront as we said. A key part of the strategy was to pull back the amount of linear inventory that we sold in the upfront having the breath as portfolio that we had was really what enabled us to absorb the demand while still holding out linear volume.","So, in terms of what that actually was we really something that were going to disclose because it is not helpful to us from a competitive standpoint, but we did hold back significant linear inventory just this of balance really well as we head into our market, unfolding going forward we think is probably stronger than we've seen no long time.","Bob Bakish","We will take our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Marci Ryvicker","I have two questions. Bob did you see that all traditional distributors have been renewed at this point.","Bob Bakish","Marci, we said virtually all there's a little bit to go in 25, but the vast, vast majority of the sub base is complete and we're feeling really good about that, it's clear evidence that our strategy which we embarked on in 2017, where we look to partner and broaden the set of activities we're doing with folks putting advanced advertising, co-productions in some cases and now broadband, mobile and Pluto TV is clearly working and that's really taken a big risk of the stock we feel great about it.","Marci Ryvicker","Okay. And then is there anything you can tell us about Pluto users, their demographic, what they are watching, how they are watching, where they are coming from, how you are getting them et cetera.","Wade Davis","So, we are super proud of the progress we're making on Pluto. As we said in our prepared remarks, but at the end of July, we had 18 million monthly average uniques, significant growth over what we announced in the in the previous quarter, this growth is coming from all the right places. These are 18 million U.S. uniques, there are overwhelmingly consuming content on connected TV. We've seen the connected TV cohort grow over 400% on a year-over-year basis.","In terms of what they're watching -- the biggest categories and genres in terms of the consumption, movies, news, entertainment, and now that we have Viacom content on their kids is one of the fastest growing categories we have, drama. And we're also incredibly excited about the launch of Pluto Latino.","This is a very important rapidly growing demographic, this underserved from an OTT standpoint, in the offering that we put up on Pluto, we think is an incredibly compelling offering. And we're very excited about what that's going to deliver us, you know, in the coming quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Doug Mitchelson","Do you know, Bob, you've got a clear focus on investing for growth and margins been down a bit this year reflects that I believe, and we look for is there a point at which you would suggest margins, you know, flattened out or grow?","And I guess, sort of backing into how much more you know, growth investment is there to do? And, and when did the returns on that actually start to sort of offset new investment. And then Wade, if you could help us on affiliate revenue within a contribution, this quarter, promote OTT spot and a studio production revenue? Sort of what was the impact of that category of revenue. Thanks.","Wade Davis","Yes, why don't we actually flip it, do you want me to take the margins and you take affiliate?","Bob Bakish","Sure.","Wade Davis","Okay. So, in terms of in terms of the ongoing growth investments, it's fairly modest. And it's important to note that we're actually stepping on the gas where we're seeing delivered, where we're seeing the ability to deliver results, right. So, as we've seen Pluto traction, begin to take hold, we've started incrementally investing to support and help accelerate that growth.","You know, we are starting to invest incrementally in our niche B2C products, as Bob described. And obviously, we're investing in supporting the AMS infrastructure. When you take all of that together, these are very modest incremental investments in the scheme of Viacom, we are going to continue to invest in things like Pluto, obviously, it's in a hyper growth mode, it's going to require investment in order to continue to support that.","But one of the great things about Pluto is that the majority of its cost structure is variable. So, unlike a lot of the lot of other people's forays into this area, we don't have to invest significantly ahead of the curve in terms of big fixed costs, licenses and content distribution. So, we're able to grow the cost structure as the business as the business grows.","In terms of overall margins, you know, we've talked a lot previously about our cost transformation activities, we are able to, we continue to be able to drop significant savings to the bottom line. So, you know, in this quarter, if you look at SG&A improvements, we were able to improve SG&A by a couple percent net of add and promo expense. And so those savings are really allowing us to invest in these growth initiatives without really impacting by accounts bottom line.","Bob Bakish","Yes, and in terms of your question on over the top in the like, in the affiliate number, the reality is, I'm not going to unpack that because we have a multifaceted distribution business, which is reflected of the significantly broader landscape that we now operate in Viacom IP is in demand, you know, across this landscape. In many sectors, we're working to satisfy that demand. And that's driving growth overall in distribution. And that's really how you need to think about it.","Doug Mitchelson","If I could just follow up, Bob, if you sort of carry forward with waves comments on the growth question, have you sort of checked the box on a lot of the things that you wanted to do regarding driving growth initiatives? Or should we expect that there's, you know, you know, plenty more to come?","Bob Bakish","Well, I think we're just getting to an inflection point. Obviously, if you go back, you know, two, three years, we had a bunch of near-term revitalization work we had to do, and I won't recover that. But we said simultaneously, we'd evolve the company for the future. And when we entered fiscal 2019, we said we were really leaning into that side. And that's exactly what we've been doing.","And then you look at our third fiscal quarter and the returns growth, so many metrics. You're seeing it actually start to play through the P&L. And our focus now is on continuing to ramp that. And that might be, well, that includes ramping things like our Pluto platform, ensuring that broadband only and for that matter, video bundled consumers first in the U.S., but really all around the world have a premium content experience that leads the industry that includes our advanced marketing solution business, which as Wade discussed, really differentiated us in the quarter in the upfront and sustained and sets us up and actually already has returned us to sustainable growth. So, you know, you should expect us to keep doing that.","And you should also expect us to continue to look for ways to evolve our business and take advantages in a glass half full way of the many opportunities, the shifting landscape presents.","Doug Mitchelson","All right, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield, please proceed with your question.","Bob Bakish","Rich, you might be on mute?","Rich Greenfield","Sorry about that. Viacom and Discovery appear to be leading the industry in ad sales, which is my guess is probably pretty counterintuitive to most people listening to this morning's call. It is unscripted, outperforming scripted. And is that what's driving the improvement that you're seeing relative to the rest of the industry?","And just from a housekeeping standpoint, how much was the you know, I think you close Pluto towards the end of last quarter, how much was the first time Pluto impact on ad sales just so we can kind of get a sense of what the underlying organic growth was. And I realized there's probably a point in there for Easter as well.","And then just a follow-up for Bob, you would talk to earlier in the year pretty excitedly about mobile MVPD deals, I think you would point to T-Mobile being kind of first of its kind. We haven't really seen much materialize there. Will it a timing issue? How soon? How should we think about kind of the mobile MVPD opportunity? Thanks.","Bob Bakish","Sure. So, a lot there. So, I'm all about I'm not going to comment on Discovery. I can tell you from the Viacom perspective, we saw our networks grow audience share in fiscal Q3, certainly unscripted\/reality, is a programming genre that works for us. You know, with it, that's a big part of the MTV resurgence, for sure shows like Ex on the Beach, The Hill, Jersey Shore, et cetera. They all are actually pretty monetizable as well.","So that's working for us. But obviously, that's not the only thing, you know, as we said, the real driver of and sales growth is our ability to access incremental inventory and sophisticated ways, i.e. advanced marketing solutions. And Wade, I'm sure will comment on that.","Before he does, let me just take your mobile question. You know, you're right. I've talked about mobile for a while now and it's because we continue to think that it is a really substantial opportunity to unlock in terms of consumers having these devices, they're kind of the remote controls for their life. They're with them all the time and plant are now at a place where they are super video enabled. And the business is very commoditized, and carriers are looking for ways to drive data ARPU and differentiation.","We've done a bunch of mobile deals in both the U.S. and around the world, certainly the US, AT&T Watch where we added three additional services as part of our last deal. T-Mobile and their forthcoming service. And then really X-US after the six mobile deals we did in the last quarter. We're now up to 34 operating and I think we're at the very early days of this. So, very exciting development for our industry and Viacom, certainly in particular.","Wade Davis","So, in terms of the impact of Pluto in the quarter, this was the first full quarter that we benefited from Pluto. Pluto, as we've said before, is part of AMS, it's not something that we break out separately, it's part of AMS because it's integral to how we operate the AMS business.","We're already using Pluto inventory to fulfill Vantage campaigns. We're using Pluto inventory to satisfy certain areas of bundled delivery. So, it's an integral part of not only AMS, but the overall ad solutions business.","But, probably the most important thing or at least the most direct answer to your questions like the U.S. and I can tell you that without Pluto, we still would have grown domestic ad sales in the quarter and Pluto, it really wasn't the only bright spot in AMS.","Vantage grew over 80%, social and digital grew over 50% as we added new source of inventory, like I said in the remarks DIRECTV Now, AT&T Watch. So, I mean AMS is hundreds of millions of dollars through 80% from the quarter is an incredibly differentiated and strategic asset for Viacom leading the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Hodulik","Great. Maybe a couple quick follow ups on Pluto. Bob, you mentioned when you acquired the company that one of the big sources of upside was going to be this sell that sort of 50% of the inventory that was going on sold? Just any progress you make there in terms of plugging that inventory into AMS and into sort of your own sort of sales infrastructure?","And then maybe Wade, you talked about the engagement, but any metrics, you can provide, I mean you put a lot of new content on Pluto is there -- that you got 18 million monthly users. But anything you can tell specifically on what's happening in terms of engagement. Is that growing as we're seeing this more content on the platform? Thanks.","Wade Davis","Yes, for sure. So, let me just start with the content part. We continue to make great progress with -- from a content standpoint. We have over 65,000 hours of content on the Pluto platform cross, what's now, we're now over 200 channels on the platform. And it comes from about 165 content partners. So, it's an incredibly robust, probably unlike anything else in the marketplace in terms of premium content and that content really is working.","So, it is driving significant, really month-over-month, per user watch times. It's not something that we're specifically disclosing. But the growth in watch time coupled with the very rapid growth and overall usage. The growth of 18 million monthly average unique is driving inventory of volume and obviously the massive that the inventory volume is growing at a pace that exceeds what the absolute audience volume growth is.","And I guess that's a good segment into your question about fill rate, right? So, in terms of fill rate when we bought the business, it was significantly under 50%. And I guess we have a little bit of a kind of rich [ph]problem here and the sense that we're making great progress on fill rate, both from a direct sales and indirect sales standpoint.","But the absolute volume of inventory on Pluto is scaling so rapidly, that we're actually still under 50% sold. And so, as volume continues to scale rapidly, we have an incredible amount of room to run from a monetization standpoint.","Bob Bakish","Yes. And just to add to that, I mean, I think that's just raising the feeling. The reality is, we said, we plugged Pluto into our infrastructure in a whole bunch of ways, content, distribution and ad sales. And the ad sales point, what you're asking about. We definitely did it. It's helping us in scatter market, we made a very material upfront based on a standalone basis for Pluto and part of AMS and therefore part of solutions.","So, that's got great traction in the marketplace. And we just keep having more and more premium inventory to sell, which just means the thing continues to have the potential to get even bigger. So, we're thrilled that we did this. It's working even faster than we planned. And it's a really great road ahead.","John Hodulik","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Swinburne","Hi. Good morning, guys. Bob, if you gave this earlier, Wade, I apologize. But I wanted to ask you if you could size the sort of TV production business now at Viacom kind of across Paramount and the media networks and what that looks like as you head into next year, and whether you think they'll start being sort of profitable or meaningfully profitable in that business?","And then secondly, sort of sticking on the Paramount side. I think your TV licensing deal in the U.S. with FX is up in a couple years. Just wondering if you how you think about the opportunity around licensing on in the pay one window, whether that whole marketplace is change. Do you think there's that you may take that content in a different direction or sort of how you think the market shifts around in the context of that opportunity for Paramount?","Bob Bakish","Yes. Sure, Ben. So, look, as we said, our studio production business continues to scale very rapidly. That's true. It's Paramount where, as I indicated, we have 26 series now order to production I think in the last call we were up to 22. We have productions in place at our domestic media networks and I also mentioned that we continue to see that scaling at this. So, we feel great about that. We\u2019re definitely on track to what we said which is an exit velocity in 2020 of $1 billion and that would include profitability.","On the second part of your question, which goes to the Paramount, let's call it Pay One window that\u2019s still -- we\u2019re not going to anticipate that\u2019s still a little way off, but that's a place where time is our friend.","The value of that window that product probably increases every day, we regularly get inbound interest in that product from a range of players sort of a cross platforms, we\u2019re not doing anything in the near future because again we think time is our friend and as time plays out, we\u2019ll determine the highest and best use of it.","And by the way as time plays out, you\u2019ll see what a powerhouse Paramount will become on a slate basis because we just talked about the 20-slate book. We\u2019ve also looked along and into the pipeline looks phenomenal and these guys really know what they\u2019re doing. So that window will have incredible value to us once we make the decision on that.","Ben Swinburne","Got it.","Wade Davis","Operator we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay our next question comes from Tim Nolan of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Nolan","Thanks so much. Really appreciate the comments on AMS I wonder if I could dig into just a little bit more in relation to the upfront. I mean AMS is a very different piece from your traditional upfront negotiations. Are you selling this is like a package with your linear upfront deals, is it a separate sale?","I just wonder if you can give us a bit more color on how you\u2019re using AMS in the upfront and perhaps relatedly, I believe there\u2019s an open AP 2.0 I guess you would call it supposedly due to launch this fall, any updates on consortium partners or anything new to say on open AP? Thanks.","Wade Davis","Sure. So, AMS really allowed us to go into the upfront with the right strategy at the right time. Right, the overall market context for this upfront was linear inventory scarcity that everybody only expected to increase overtime and so having this portfolio of products to be able to take to the marketplace as a package was really-really differentiated but most importantly was the place we\u2019re able to absorb volume while still driving credit on the linear side of equation. So, the answer to your question about is the package is resoundingly yes.","And I think it\u2019s important to note that the way in which we brought it to market with a construct that every major holding company participated in. So, the strategy not only delivered results for us, but it was also embraced by the industry as a way to deliver results for their clients.","So, we couldn't be happier with both how AMS is performing in general but also the way in which it allowed us to have a differentiated offering going into the upfront.","In terms of open AP 2.0 that represents a very significant and interesting step forward for that consortium as we think about moving our open AP functionality from being really a tool for creation and posting the advance TV segments to starting to become a broader plan and then ultimately planning tool and ultimately buying process.","But in terms of the more specific announcements on consortium partners and the actual roll out of the product I think it\u2019s best to leave that the consortium itself.","Bob Bakish","So, look, in closing I trust you can also we had a great quarter and I'm really pleased with the performance we continue to demonstrate as we invested in all of Viacom for the future.","We\u2019re building off of our existing linear TV and film base, we\u2019re expanding on a global basis. We\u2019re rapidly growing our premium content reach beyond our traditional networks including in D2C and we\u2019re creating innovative solutions for our growing roster of partners.","Our brands are strong and they\u2019re resonating with audiences of all ages and you see that in our hits. We built a sophisticated advanced marketing solutions portfolio that ideally suited to evolving marketplace and you see that in our return advertising growth.","And we've achieved a strong presence across the diversity of ecosystem, ranging from traditional MVPDs to VMVPDs, niche S5 mobile and now free streaming, which means we're entertaining more consumers than ever.","In short, our strategy to evolve Viacom for the future is working. And our business model allows us to thrive and grow in what is rapidly changing media landscape. We're excited by the opportunity and growth ahead and we thank all of you for your support and time.","We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for our June quarter. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.","Now I want to refer you to Page #2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Sumner.","Sumner M. Redstone","Good morning. It is truly a great pleasure to welcome you to VIAB's conference call today.","As you know, this morning, we reported solid growth, due once again to VIAB's powerful entertainment brands and the work of our truly extraordinary executive team. The winds of change are all around us, but even as the distribution landscape evolves, the value of content and the creativity that drives its success has never, never been greater.","VIAB's content is in strong demand, with key audiences in both new and established pathways. Our management team is leading a creative resurgence at Viacom, while continuing [ph] execution, drive efficiency, and as evidenced by our expanded buyback program, return value to shareholders.","Now, I would like to turn this call over to VIAB's outstanding leader, my friend, my colleague, the wisest man I have ever known, Philippe Dauman.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you very much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss the third quarter of our fiscal year.","The June quarter was a strong one for Viacom. The results we announced this morning attest to that. And as I will discuss in a moment, the significance of our performance goes beyond financial results. We saw great creative and operational success throughout the quarter and positive signs that our momentum will continue.","Thanks to our sustained investment in original content, we continued to see sequential ratings improvement at a number of our key networks. Nickelodeon is clearly on the way back, with new live-action and animated hits that fueled robust ratings. We completed our upfront negotiations early and very successfully, achieving significant volume increases in a difficult market. We also struck a distribution deal with Amazon in which we received great value for our content and gained a strong promotional platform for our consumer products. And Paramount Pictures launched 2 commercially successful and critically lauded tentpoles with Star Trek Into Darkness and World War Z.","Tom and Wade will go into greater detail in a moment, but let me briefly recap Viacom's financial performance for the quarter. Revenues increased 14% to $3.69 billion and operating income grew 20% to $1.09 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased 24% to $635 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 33% to $1.29.","We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share from $0.275 per share, effective with the dividend paid July 1. We also repurchased $700 million of stock in the quarter, under what was our $10 billion share repurchase program. We are today announcing an increase in the size of our buyback program from $10 billion to $20 billion.","Given our improving operational and ad sales performance, improving U.S. macroeconomic environment and the attractive interest rate environment, we are comfortable returning to our target leverage ratio prior to the recession. As a result, we are increasing our target ratio to the 2.75 to 3.0 range.","Viacom's stock is a very good value. Our share buyback remains very accretive. And we will continue to aggressively return capital to our shareholders. Accordingly, given the added balance sheet capacity from our new leverage target, we will augment our current buyback pace with the purchase of an additional $2 billion of our stock over the next several months. The pace of our open-market purchases, which are part of the $20 billion program, will be subject to regulatory limits on trading volume. After December 31, we anticipate that our buybacks will return to a pace comparable to our most recent quarters.","Moving on to our Media Networks. Revenue in the segment grew 13% to $2.57 billion, thanks to growth in both advertising and affiliate revenues. Domestic advertising revenue increased 6% on the strength of continued ratings improvement among our networks. For the September quarter, we expect to see continued sequential improvement in ad revenue growth.","For the adult upfront market, we secured mid-single-digit volume growth by moving early while also improving our mix of advertisers. We saw a great outcome on the kids side, too, where we maintained volume and increased our share in a market that was down overall.","Domestic affiliate revenue grew 28% in the quarter, thanks to the benefit of our digital distribution agreements and rate increases. Core domestic affiliate growth, which excludes digital distribution, increased in the high-single-digit range. We expect total domestic affiliate growth of 10% for the full fiscal year.","In June, we completed a landmark multiyear agreement with Amazon for distribution of a broad selection of library programming from across our brands. The deal not only reinforces the value of our content, it also validates our view that the digital distribution market remains strong and growing and will enhance the overall economic environment for must-have brands and programs. It is also noteworthy that our programming on Amazon Prime Instant Video will live in a network-branded environment, one that connects audiences with our many consumer products available through the world's leading online retailer.","We continue to mine digital distribution opportunities abroad as well, where we recently renewed our agreement with Netflix in Latin America. And as part of our broader Amazon agreement, we struck a deal with LoveFilm in the U.K. and Germany.","Our ratings resurgence is a big part of the story, so let me take a moment to touch on highlights at a few of our networks. At Nickelodeon, our sustained investment in new original content, driven by a reinvigorated programming and development team, led to significant ratings gains. Nickelodeon was up 11% in its core demo for the quarter. Nickelodeon also drove viewing among kids 2 to 5 in the quarter, as the network strategy to move preschool programming from Nick Jr. to Nick in key dayparts continued to pay off.","Several new Nick shows emerged as hits right out of the gate. The live-action comedy, Sam & Cat, from Nick's marquee hit maker, Dan Schneider, is performing very well in its debut season, as is the animated series Sanjay and Craig, which has the offbeat sensibility of many of the network's most iconic hits. Haunted Hathaways, another live-action series, premiered in the current quarter to more than 3 million viewers. These new hits are significant, not only for their big viewership, but also for their strategic timing. Each will be well established with audiences in advance of the holiday season, Nick's most critical quarter from an ad sale standpoint. We'll have new episodes of these new shows; new series, Rabbids and The Thundermans; and new seasons of Fairly Odd Parents, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Legend of Korra in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, as well as several preschool premieres and holiday specials.","July marked Nickelodeon's sixth straight month of year-over-year ratings growth. With ratings stable and growing, Nickelodeon is striving to raise the bar. We will continue to fuel the pipeline, investing in promising original content, new producers and new talent to increasingly diversify the programming mix. We are very optimistic that Nickelodeon's upward trajectory will continue.","We are optimistic that Nick at Nite will continue its recent growth streak as well. In the June quarter, Nick at Nite ratings were up 29% in its core demo. And nearly every show in the Nick at Nite lineup increased ratings over last year. Full House, in particular, has brought the network significant strength in prime that is carrying throughout the schedule.","MTV saw the successful return of several hits in the third quarter, including Awkward, Catfish and Teen Wolf, which is attracting series-high ratings in its third season. We increased the marketing push behind the new season, responding to ratings trends, which show that highly serialized shows can often capture significant new viewership in season 3.","MTV continues to build out a balanced schedule of hits in its critical 10 Spot time period. Most recently, we established a strong position on Thursday nights with Ridiculousness, which continues to build viewership and repeat well across dayparts. MTV also expanded the Guy Code franchise in the third quarter with the premiere of Girl Code, another cost-efficient series that strengthens our Tuesday night female programming block and repeats well.","MTV held its summer pilot screenings at the end of July, featuring a significantly higher volume of potential series, reflecting not only our stepped-up investment in more original content, but also the healthy output of our new development team. MTV is currently reviewing these pilots, and you will start to see some of those series on the network in early 2014.","CMT delivered a stellar performance in the third quarter. The network increased ratings by 29% in its core 18 to 49 demo, making it 1 of the 5 fastest-growing entertainment networks in cable for the quarter. This success is the culmination of our ongoing efforts to transform CMT's programming. The network completely revamped its development team, creating a tri-coastal group in Nashville, Los Angeles and New York with increased expertise in areas including brand development, field production and talent casting. The new team has doubled CMT's programming output while only incrementally increasing costs, with a focus on bold, highly repeatable shows that harken back to the network's country music core and echo its themes.","Dog and Beth: On the Hunt is a great example and has emerged in its first season as the network's top series. It's brought a lot of new viewers to CMT, helping lift ratings across the schedule. There's a lot of room to grow at CMT, and we see great things ahead.","At BET, the first-ever BET Experience in June was a creative and commercial success. The 3-day festival in Los Angeles attracted more than 100,000 visitors and featured many unique sponsorships that connected marketers with the BET audience in new ways. The event gave the BET Awards a big lift, airing the show to 7.8 million viewers, its second-highest viewership total ever. The BET Awards also provided a strong promotional platform for a new season of The Game; and TV movie Being Mary Jane, starring Gabrielle Union, which BET has picked up as an ongoing series. I'm happy to share that we will present the BET Experience again next year.","Our brands continue to drive the conversation on social platforms. The BET Awards generated nearly 10 million tweets, for example. In June, we entered an ad partnership with Twitter through its Amplify product that will launch during MTV's Video Music Awards, another social powerhouse, and roll out across our brands to further monetize our enormous Twitter footprint.","We are doing equally well in the branded app space. The Nickelodeon app has reached 3 million installs in less than 6 months, remarkably quick, and is seeing strong user engagement. The app was well received by our marketing partners at the kids upfront. The MTV app has already been downloaded more than 0.5 million times since its launch in mid-June and is attracting significant advertiser interest, not only in MTV's full-length programming but also for its MTV Other content studio, which struck a marketing partnership with Starcom.","COMEDY CENTRAL and VH1 will launch branded apps by year's end. And COMEDY CENTRAL's newly launched Stand-Up app has drawn significant downloads and user time spent. Speaking of COMEDY CENTRAL, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the network for earning 18 Emmy nominations. It's a new record for comedy, which is always well represented at the Emmys.","Finally, Viacom International Media Networks continues to be flexible in its market-to-market approach across the world. We are moving to full ownership models for MTV in Brazil, Russia and Italy, acquiring full operational and editorial control of the brand in these key markets. We see solid long-term opportunities for an owned and operated MTV in these markets, bringing them closer into our centralized global structure to ensure that the network is programmed with the best possible mix of international and local content, resulting in the strongest possible representation of the iconic MTV brand.","Moving on to our Filmed Entertainment segment. Revenues increased 15% to $1.16 billion in the third quarter. Paramount Pictures launched 2 strong tentpoles in Star Trek Into Darkness and World War Z, which are on their way to nearly $1 billion combined at the worldwide box office. Operating results in this segment were negatively impacted by the timing of distribution costs associated with World War Z and Star Trek Into Darkness.","The next quarter will show significant profitability for Paramount, including from these 2 films. They will likely be moderately less than we anticipated, due to the crowded tentpole schedule this summer and the delay of certain film licensing deals into next fiscal year. For 2014 fiscal year, Paramount will bring several hit franchises back to the big screen with Anchorman 2, a new Paranormal Activity, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, and Transformers 4; and launch high-potential new tentpoles with Jack Ryan and Ninja Turtles.","Next fiscal year, we'll also see several projects enter the pipeline at Paramount Television. Last week, we named Amy Powell as President of the new television studio, adding to her duties as Paramount's head of Digital and its Insurge Pictures unit. And this week, Paramount Animation made news on 2 upcoming projects for 2015: First, the release date for the SpongeBob SquarePants movie has been set for February 13, 2015. And in late May 2015, Paramount will bring another exciting animated feature to theaters with Monster Trucks, which will be directed by Chris Wedge, the Oscar-winning director of Ice Age and Epic.","In closing, it was a pivotal quarter for Viacom in which our consistent investment in great content ultimately fueled strong top and bottom line growth. In fiscal 2013, we are investing more than ever in new content, more than $3 billion for our networks in total. Our networks are bringing more and more original content to their screens, resulting in ratings momentum and healthy growth in our principal revenue stream. Paramount Pictures presented 2 successful summer tentpoles and looks to fiscal 2014 with a promising slate.","We remain steadfastly committed to delivering value and are very pleased to be returning even more capital to our shareholders.","Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.","Now, let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 13% compared with the prior year, with domestic revenues up 15% and international revenues up 4%. Foreign exchange had a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues. The increase in revenues in the quarter was principally driven by increases in affiliate and advertising revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.","Domestic advertising revenues were up 6% in the quarter, and international revenues were down 6%. The decrease in international advertising was largely driven by softness in Europe.","In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 28% in the quarter, while international revenues were up 16%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under digital distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits. Growth in international revenues was due to rate and subscriber increases, new channel launches, as well as growth in digital distribution revenue related to the timing of product availability.","Expenses increased 6% in the quarter. Within expenses, programming expense grew 5%, distribution and other expenses increased 47% and SG&A expense was up 2%. The increase in distribution and other expenses was largely driven by participation associated with a digital distribution deal. Excluding the impact from the deal, distribution and other expenses were up 5% in the quarter.","Media Networks adjusted operating income was up 24%, and the adjusted operating income margin was 45%, up approximately 390 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin increase was driven by top line growth of 13%, partially offset by 6% growth in expenses.","Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were up 15% in the quarter, principally driven to higher theatrical -- principally due to higher theatrical revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.","Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 64%, primarily due to higher carryover revenues from the March quarter release of G.I. Joe: Retaliation, as well as higher revenues from the current quarter's releases including Star Trek Into Darkness and World War Z.","Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 10%, reflecting lower revenues from carryover titles. Worldwide ancillary revenues increased 6%, primarily due to the sale to Disney of the distribution rights to the 4 Marvel films that we previously released theatrically.","Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $17 million in the quarter, as compared to $46 million last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects distribution costs associated with the release of World War Z at the end of the quarter, partially offset by the benefit from the Marvel distribution rights sale.","Now touching on corporate. Expenses increased $11 million in the quarter. The increase relates to higher deferred compensation cost driven by the appreciation in our stock price. Excluding deferred compensation costs, corporate expenses were substantially flat in the quarter.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thanks, Wade, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. And I'll also cover the seasonal factors impacting our September quarter.","For the quarter, we generated $728 million in operating free cash flow, compared to $197 million of operating free cash flow last year. Page 5 of the web deck provides components of the free cash flow.","The increase in operating free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to lower cash taxes and higher operating income, partially offset by higher working capital utilization. Cash taxes benefited from the retroactive reenactment of provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense. The unfavorable working capital variance in the quarter was principally due to the timing of collections associated with product made available under a digital distribution deal.","Now turning to our debt. For the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 25 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.","As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x. At June 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.","Our commitment to return capital to shareholders continued in the June quarter, as we returned a total of $834 million of capital back to our shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs. Philippe has already addressed our increased buyback authorization and our continued aggressive capital return going forward.","Now, let's turn to some of the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of the fiscal year. For fiscal 2013, we anticipate domestic affiliate revenue growth of 10%. Accordingly, in the September quarter, affiliate revenue growth will be in the high single digits. For the full year, we continue to expect high-single-digit growth rates for Media Networks programming expense. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.","Moving on to taxes. Given the strong performance of our films overseas, we now forecast a book tax rate of 34% for 2013. As for cash taxes, due primarily to the retroactive reenactment of provisions related to film and TV product that I mentioned earlier, cash taxes will be significantly lower than book taxes for fiscal 2013. Accordingly, we see strong free cash flow growth for the year.","In summary, we are encouraged as we continue to make progress in improving our ratings and our ad sales performance. We are investing in original content, with a focus on improving those demos and dayparts that have the greatest impact on ad sales. We are also investing in our organization and our infrastructure in order to engage and monetize our audiences as they increasingly embrace consumption of our content on digital platforms. As we do this, we are gaining additional insight into our viewers, enabling us to provide unique opportunities and additional value for our advertising partners. With the increase in the size of our buyback program and our target leverage ratio, given the low capital intensity of our business and our focus on driving margins and free cash flow, Viacom continues to demonstrate a strong capital allocation discipline and a commitment to driving shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn it over to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Philippe, with the U.S. outlook gaining visibility, can you refresh the outlook for international growth? I think, over the last few years, you've emphasized an international margin opportunity. And there's a wide variety of growth rates among the various media companies in terms of international cable networks. Where should Viacom shake out looking forward? And how do you drive that business?","Philippe P. Dauman","Doug, the -- our international networks have been hurt this year by the slow environment in Europe. We had negative ad sales growth in the quarter that just ended, although we expect that we'll turn back to positive ad sales growth in this quarter. And as we are launching new networks, which we have been doing, and turning certain networks into wholly-owned networks, we expect the performance to improve as we go forward. In the meantime, we're using this opportunity to expand our footprint and really build value for the future. There's a lot of value there, and we're building very valuable assets, really, across all continents right now.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you see a point where...","Thomas E. Dooley","And as the foreign markets recover, especially in Southern Europe, I think the group is very well poised to really take advantage of that and put up some very significant growth statistics.","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes. And meanwhile, we'll continue to drive affiliate revenue growth in our international footprint.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you see a point where international growth is actually accretive to the overall growth rate for the division?","Thomas E. Dooley","Absolutely.","Philippe P. Dauman","Absolutely.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then, just a clarification. The July repurchases pace was a little bit slower. And I -- you gave a lot of details around increasing the buyback. But just timing-wise, does that mean that $700 million pace isn't the right number for the September quarter in terms of the -- in other words, we're trying to figure out is it $700 million a quarter, plus $2 billion? Or is it a little less than $700 million this quarter because July was less?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we have a blackout period ahead of the earnings, so that accounts for the what appears to be a slower pace at the beginning of the quarter. But we -- as we discussed the last earnings call, we had budgeted for $700 million of buyback in this quarter. Obviously, today, with the announcement of the augmented buyback program, we will add $2 billion over the next several months to our normal $700 million pace for this quarter and next quarter.","Operator","And next we'll go to Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You've got some very favorable sort of industry trends in the back half of the calendar year now through December with a pickup in kids-oriented films and then the 2 competing video game console launches. How should that -- I mean, should that impact have an incremental sort of boost to how we should think about advertising revenues for sort of the next sort of 5 months or so?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, certainly, we do have a favorable environment generally and a favorable environment as it relates specifically to Nickelodeon ratings. As you recall, in last year's December quarter, we had -- we were having ratings issue, so we were unable to meet demand in that we didn't have enough inventory to meet the holiday season advertising demand. So as you point out, we have more inventory to sell, as our ratings have improved. And as you correctly pointed out, particularly in the games area, there are a lot of new consoles and big games interesting kids.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then when you're looking at the ratings at MTV, could you give us some color? Is there a more meaningful pickup between the sort of the standard day ratings we typically see and either the C3 or maybe even the C7 kind of data that you may get that would potentially be a benefit if we do see a change now from sort of a C3 to a sort of C7 system down the road?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we certainly get -- I mean, right now, we monetize C3. We certainly see, across many of our networks, a lift when you go to C3. And we've been investing in our programming in our key networks, where there are revenues to be had. So our ratings performance has improved, and MTV included. If you look at the beginning of this fourth quarter, our ratings are up year-on-year across -- pretty much across-the-board, with the exception of Nick Jr., where we strategically moved some programming off, onto Nickelodeon.","Thomas E. Dooley","Alexia, we've also had good strength, very good growth in ratings in primetime demos across certain key monetizable networks, which really helps us drive advertising sales, as the value of ratings in those times period is critical for us.","Operator","Next we'll go to Rich Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","I'm wondering -- you made this big change in where you sell your digital rights in the U.S. And I think, Philippe, you took a lot of heat for selling to Netflix originally. There was a lot of skeptics saying that, that's why Nickelodeon ratings were down. And clearly, Nickelodeon's rebounding, regardless of your digital deal. But wondering, as you look at the early data that you're seeing from Amazon, what is the actual utilization of your content look like during the current few months of this contract versus what you were seeing? I mean, Amazon appears to have far fewer streaming users than Netflix. Do you look at that kind of exposure of your content being positive, negative for -- in terms of what happens to your ratings? Just, how do you think about that dynamic? Because you obviously made the choice to sell to Amazon versus Netflix.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, yes, we were in discussions with all players in the digital distribution universe. And we ended up with Amazon in this particular case for the content that we licensed to them because of the great dynamics of the overall deal. And to your specific question, yes, Amazon Prime today has significantly less reach than Netflix. Obviously, our content will help drive their sub numbers up, which is why they were very interested in our content. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we also like the Amazon environment in that our brands are brought out more clearly in the Amazon Prime environment than they are in the Netflix environment. But we continue to do business with Netflix around the world and expect to do so in the future. We said previously that it's hard to measure the impact on ratings, but we did look at a number of our streams, and even if you assume that it was all cannibalistic, it had a -- it would have a very modest impact on ratings. So we never thought that was a major factor. But overall, the -- we're extremely satisfied with the Amazon deal, both for monetary and nonmonetary reasons.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And you can still sell content to Netflix from Nickelodeon and your other networks. You just have certain exclusivities, but we could still expect a deal from you in the U.S. for some of the Dora content and other Nickelodeon titles?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we have -- we do have some degrees of exclusivity. We have a lot of content available to license to all distributors concerned.","Thomas E. Dooley","Of course, as you know with your kids, kids are going to consume -- certain kids are going to consume content on tablets. And you have -- if you want your content to have a shot at being consumed, you have to have it on a tablet. So we're aggressively putting our content up on tablets through distribution partnerships and also using now the Nick app, which has been phenomenally successful, because we want kids to be able to consume our content wherever they want to consume it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next we'll go to David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions on the digital side. The first is, could you break out on the domestic advertising base generally, how much of your advertising revenue comes from the digital side versus the traditional -- what we call the traditional side? And then can you talk about the sequential trends in the growth of those areas? And I guess, lastly, can you talk about, are you doing anything -- or have you been doing anything over the last kind of 6 to 9 months that's been particularly different about how you monetize your digital inventory?","Philippe P. Dauman","David, yes, we don't break it out because the way we sell now, we sell multi-platform packages to our major advertisers. So when we have a campaign, that campaign, for many of our advertisers, will live across multiple platforms. And as we roll out, as Tom mentioned, apps across our different brands, that is a part of what we offer. So the distinction that used to be made between digital and so-called traditional revenues is just blurring. The same goes for the creation of content. Those lines are blurring as well organizationally within our company. We have really folded in the organization such that we talk less about the manner of distribution and focus more on how we reach consumers, both from a creative standpoint and from an engagement standpoint. So it all works together. Clearly, in terms of the sequential trend, we have been increasing our resources in presenting content, creating content and providing richer opportunities for our advertising partners to engage consumers.","Thomas E. Dooley","David, also, from a trend point of view, display in terms of its importance is going down, and video inventory is going up in value and up in volume. So that plays to our strong suit as we continue to emphasize that across our house.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And I guess, just one quick follow-up. If you think about the measurement, because as Philippe said, you're -- these are really integrated products now, are you selling the digital portion on an OCR basis? Or are these -- are there still sort of different currencies for those impressions? That's my last question.","Philippe P. Dauman","We're not participating in the OCR system, which we believe has a number of flaws, but what we are able to do, we have first-party data on our digital distribution. So we provide -- we can marry the first-party data that we have with, for example, traditional Nielsen ratings on our television screens. And increasingly, you will see the importance of first-party data growing, and as well as other third-party data sources growing. So the -- that all works to our benefit, because we have a lot of viewing that is not measured by traditional sources.","Thomas E. Dooley","David, there is an emergent currency that is growing fast in alternative currency to the industry standard.","Operator","Next we'll go to Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","First, one follow-up on your comments around working capital and just to get a sense of, are the digital distribution deals generally featuring payment terms that are somewhat more pushed out than, I guess, your affiliate fees with conventional distributors? Semi-relatedly, have you been seeing any pushback from marketers in terms of their payment terms? Certainly have heard a lot of the noise around that with the global ad agencies. And then I'll just ask my other unrelated question to that. You mentioned the BET event. I was curious, what percentage -- or can you characterize, how much of your ad sales are in any way attached to or bundled with or otherwise assigned to traditional ad sales are paired with nontraditional marketing sales?","Philippe P. Dauman","As far as the lag between recognition of revenue from the digital deals and the payment, it's really a function of the fact that accounting...","Wade Davis","Syndication accounting takes place.","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes. So those, the accounting rules require you to record revenues associated with content when it's available and payment terms are normal. They normalize over the course of the deal, as are traditional deals. So there's no difference from a collection-of-fee standpoint as far as that goes. As far as the payments from advertisers, Wade? [indiscernible] we're doing -- we don't see an issue there from our standpoint, or in terms of collections.","Wade Davis","None whatsoever.","Philippe P. Dauman","And as far as BET Experience. BET Experience was an unusual and very successful effort on our part to have -- to turn what was the BET Awards into a multi-day experience where we had a number of concerts, stand-up comedy, panels, promotional opportunities for advertisers. So in that particular case that you cited, we had a lot of nontraditional marketing opportunities that were tied to our event. At the same time, the excitement surrounding the whole weekend experience really was a part of driving our ratings. So it just -- it provided a lot of marketing value for our television show, which made it very successful from an advertising sales standpoint.","Thomas E. Dooley","And Brian, to the extent of the classification of the revenues, the revenues that were advertising revenues or advertisers buying time in, around that event were classified as advertising. And our participation in other revenue streams were classified, for the most part, as ancillary.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I get it. What I was trying to get at, I guess, is it's -- certainly as I look forward a few years, post all the changes with the agencies, it seems that one of the more important things that media owners are doing, I guess, is events like this. So just trying to get a sense of to what degree that offering more, let's use the word native, sort of marketing activities are playing out in your universe?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, in general, integrated marketing is a huge selling point for our company. We have a lot of events. We have a lot of shows that lend themselves to in-show marketing and related marketing on social media and elsewhere. So that's been a part of what we do. And that -- and the importance of that keeps growing.","Thomas E. Dooley","A great example of that would be a car company who is at the event with their automobiles. This gives them an ability to have a physical presence tied to an advertising buy around the event. To Philippe's point, this integrated marketing concept is becoming more and more and more important and a major area of emphasis for us and other large media companies.","Philippe P. Dauman","Not to mention the fact that the marketers, our clients, love to come to these events. They really get to see our brands live with their fans. So it just creates a great sales opportunity as well.","Operator","Next we'll go to Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on the longer-term financial model. I think you guys have said in the past that you expect, over the longer term, high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth in affiliate fees. I'm just wondering if you could affirm that, if you still see that, and do you think next year has a chance of achieving that level of growth, even incorporating the Amazon comp? And then I actually have a couple of quick follow-ups.","Philippe P. Dauman","Anthony, yes, we continue to see high-single-digit to low-double-digit affiliate revenue growth next year and for the foreseeable future.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And on programming expense growth, I think, Tom, you said in your prepared comments, high-single-digit growth for fiscal '13. With all the content that you're investing in going into next year, how do you think that programming expense growth in '14 will compare to '13? Is it -- is there anything you could tell us directionally on that?","Thomas E. Dooley","Yes, we'll still be in the mid- to high-single-digit range. We're actually in the midst of budgets right now. We have good visibility on that. So we think that'll be the case.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then last one, Philippe, I mean, I feel like with each successive acceleration in the buyback program, we're sort of getting the message, this is a creeping LBO. And I just wonder, do you ever foresee a situation in the future where you took in all the public float and Viacom were not a public company? Wondering what you think about that potential at any time down the line.","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, I'm not a long-term prognosticator in that way. I just focus on the here and now. And here and now, we believe our stock is a great value, the dynamics of our business are strong and we have a lot of financial capacity. So we are just focusing on building value and returning capital to our shareholders. So this is an opportune time, particularly given current interest rate conditions, to return even more capital to our shareholders.","Operator","Next we'll take a question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2. Obviously, the increase in your target leverage ratio and the buyback is clearly a sign of your and the board's confidence in improving trends. So just, what is giving you this confidence now? Is it due to personnel changes? Is there anything else? So that's the first question. And then the second thing is, how should we think about the mix of reality versus scripted programming at MTV? Any color on what the mix is now and how this might look over time?","Philippe P. Dauman","Marci, yes, we -- our confidence is informed by the fact that, yes, we have added a lot of programming talent in our ranks. And as we look at the lineup today and going forward, we have real programming momentum across, really, all of our networks. That gives us confidence. We've just been through a very successful upfront season, and that gives us, certainly gives us confidence as we look forward into next year. And we see good underlying dynamics. Even though many would like the growth to accelerate in the U.S. economy, we do see good dynamics there. So that gave us confidence in going back to our traditional leverage ratio. As far as MTV goes, we will continue to have a mix of reality and scripted programming. We've had really good success with the scripted programming which we introduced just a few years ago, with shows like Teen Wolf and Awkward. And as you look into next year, you will see additional scripted and reality. And as you know, at MTV, we also have a revamped programming and development team. And from what I've seen so far, there's just a lot of exciting development ahead in both genres.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi Investment Research.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You guys have clearly taken market share in terms of ratings, but if I went back, if -- I don't remember how many quarters ago it was, 6 or something, there were some discussion about sampling anomalies or whatever with Nielsen. And so I guess my question is, as we think about the ratings improvement that you guys are showing, is it really one-dimensional and is it -- it's just better shows taking market share? Or is there another dimension that's helping you as well, with the tailwind maybe coming from sampling changes that occurred at Nielsen?","Philippe P. Dauman","We have no visibility on the -- on what Nielsen does, so we -- the only thing we have visibility on is the quality of our programming. We know that we have stepped it up in that area. And we're just at the beginning. We changed our programming team over the course of the last year, 1.5 years. And they have been working assiduously on working with new producers, new creators. And there's just an awful lot in the pipeline. So we tend to -- we try to focus on what we can control and what we have knowledge of. And whatever the measurement system, that will drive our future.","Operator","Next we'll go to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just -- I have a couple of questions going back to sort of figuring out the financial firepower of the balance sheet here. Tom, can you just remind me -- remind us specifically the leverage calculation? Are you talking gross debt? And what are the sort of contingent liabilities that the agencies include that we need to be mindful of as we think about that new leverage level going forward?","Thomas E. Dooley","Yes, the different rating agencies have different leverage calculations, what they include. We include our commitments that are visible on our -- in our disclosure, in our 10-K and 10-Q. We use gross debt, not net debt. And we feel that's somewhere in between some of the more traditional textbook definitions of leverage and some of the rating agencies'. So each rating agency has a different one, and you will have to go to them. We've been working and chatting with the rating agencies on this construct. And they will be issuing their commentary on it after this call.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then I think, post the $2 billion add-on, you'll be within that 2.7 to 3. So maybe you can just verify that, or if you agree or not. And going forward, beyond that, as you said you'd return to the $700 million a quarter run rate, do you plan to sort of stay within that new range, sort of at fairly strictly? And if so, should we be thinking about using any additional capacity for more buybacks as you grow the business? Or should we also be thinking about leaving some room for things like M&A and stuff?","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, Ben, let me take that. The -- our target is the leverage ratio, so that as our -- so we are managing to that leverage ratio, which we will stick with. And as we do that, we continue to invest in our business. We -- our M&A is, continues to be very limited and very targeted, it tends to be small-bore and very additive and still gives us a lot of capacity. We expect, as we said, to continue at a comparable pace as we look forward, but what we will continue to do is to evaluate it each quarter and we -- and then we announce, as we always have, what we intend to do in the following quarter when we have these earnings calls. But our current expectation is continuing at a comparable pace, which is -- which could be at the $700 million range or it could be a different number, it could be more as our business expands, or less. It really depends on what -- it's really matching to our investment-grade leverage ratio.","Thomas E. Dooley","Ben, it's critical to note that we continue to manage this with a very keen eye on the cash flow-generation capability of Viacom. As we've demonstrated in the past in the last downturn, we dramatically de-levered the company within 12 months by applying -- by tapping into the share buyback program and diverting those resources to de-lever the company. So it's -- we understand very much how we can use the accordion of the free cash flow of the company, which is very strong, to mitigate any financial uncertainty that we see coming down the road.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And maybe just one business question. You've talked over the years about moving away from acquired programming a bit. I think you guys bought Scandal from ABC. And I also know, or I've been reading, that The Simpsons maybe come available for cable syndication. Can you just talk about your appetite for acquired and maybe the rationale behind the Scandal acquisition?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, the Scandal was a very well-constructed deal. We continue -- we will continue to have a mix, particularly depending on the networks, between original programming and acquired programming. In general, across our network portfolio, the mix toward original programming will increase. In the case of Scandal, it was a unique opportunity where we have the prior seasons, which will start to air actually later this month, and building up to the new season on ABC, where we will get the right to show the episodes 8 days after it's aired on the broadcast network. So it works well for them, for their marketing purposes and is just a great acquired programming buy, it really fits into the BET brand. But we'll -- we continue to look at shows that work for our networks that have been created before. But overall, when we look at our entire portfolio, we're gradually increasing the original part of the mix.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","So for Philippe, I was very curious by your comment that the Q4 profit on the film side, much as you're expecting the 2 tentpoles to obviously be major contributors, but you alluded to the crowded tentpole summer, which we've heard more than a few times, so I was wondering how that might -- what's your philosophical thinking on that and how that kind of might affect your future release strategy around the summer? Obviously, last year, you guys were -- had a not-so-wonderful summer, and you've rebounded strongly. So I'm just kind of wondering how you'll kind of position your future films in that context? And I have a follow-up.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we always look at the proper dating of our films and so the dating changes as we see what our competitors do. This summer just had a particularly high volume of tentpole pictures from all the studios combined, and that's not going to recur every year. So that was -- some other studios' films were really shaken up by that, where they didn't succeed. We were fortunate that we had 2 strong tentpoles in Star Trek and World War Z that did really well, one a previous franchise, one a new franchise. So we have -- we hoped to drive the viewing of those 2 tentpoles for a longer period of time, to drive the profitability even higher. And the crowded schedule limited the run of a lot of pictures this summer, ours included.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Okay, that's fair enough. And separately, on the Media Network margins, how should we think about that? Obviously, you had a very major margin expansion in the quarter and I -- granted, some of that is coming from the digital distribution. But you also talked about a $3 billion in content spend, which I'm trying to connect the dots in terms of the potential impart -- impact on margins. And I guess the first thing is, in terms of that $3 billion, how much of that is kind of your kind of run rate or natural spend, as opposed to kind of an evolution of some of the factors you talked about, the blurring of the lines in content investments across your networks? So if you can all kind of put it all together to understand the context of your margins, that would be very helpful.","Thomas E. Dooley","Tuna, the $3 billion is consistent with the guidance we have given in terms of increasing the rate of change of content spend, so there's nothing new about that number. That's a number that we've had all along and the number that we've been talking about when we tell people we're going to increase in the mid-to-high single digits. So that's what's included there, that has afforded us the opportunity to dramatically expand our original content. That has been very, very successful across all the networks that we're doing it on and gives us the confidence that our ratings will continue to improve and continue to improve in timeframes, so like primetime, when we can sell that at higher revenue levels than previously. So all that is driving what I believe is a great strategy on how we invest in content, invest in programming, to drive the top line growth, which results in better margins.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Does the SVOD market dynamics affect your thinking in that regard, in terms of the investment, in terms of amount and type of programming?","Thomas E. Dooley","SVOD is another marketplace, that once again shows up, for the most part, on the affiliate line. And to a great extent, we believe if you make great programming, that great programming translates across all marketplaces.","Operator","We'll take that question from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the potential for consolidation among cable and satellite companies domestically. And I realize you don't want to comment on your specific contracts, but I was wondering if you'd be willing to share some general thoughts about what happens to the affiliate contracts in the event of consolidation among 2 cable or 2 satellite companies. Would the contracts get folded together? Or do the 2 contracts kind of run in parallel until expiration?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, look, as you correctly point out, it's hard to get into specifics. We have to see what the deals are, and every contract is different. So we -- what we focus on is just continuing to create great content, have great brands and provide great value to our viewers and to the distributors. And whatever the size of the distributor, we have -- we always have additional functionality and content to work with them on.","Andrew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and maybe one quick follow-up, if I might. Again, sorry, back on margins within the Media Networks group. I think, when you back out the digital deal, it looks like you guys are, expanded margins nicely in the quarter year-on-year. And it occurs to me, it sounds like the international margins are probably still a drag. I was wondering if you could confirm that they are kind of holding you guys back a little bit, but as things maybe pick up from a macro standpoint into next year, that, that could be a real source of opportunity?","Philippe P. Dauman","Clearly, international margins in our Media Networks business are lower than our domestic margins, but they will -- those margins, over time, will continue to grow.","Andrew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I just meant, Philippe, if they were compressing sort of year-on-year in the international margins because of the top line weakness.","Thomas E. Dooley","Drew, they are a drag mathematically on the overall margin. And when we get resumption of growth in the international space, they will become accretive to our margin growth.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everybody for joining us on our earnings call.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our CFO.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page #2 on the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.","Sumner M. Redstone","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, and welcome to Viacom's fourth quarter conference call. Once again, we have reported outstanding results, with growth across the board in the quarter. Making great content is the heart of our business, and today, we are producing more creative and exciting entertainment than ever before in our history. Our creative leadership team, led by Philippe, is ensuring that our creative success results in solid returns and growing value for our shareholders.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to my good friend, one of the wisest men I have ever met, Philippe.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you so much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by briefly covering the company's financial performance for the quarter and the full fiscal year, and then Tom and Wade will go into greater detail.","In the fourth quarter, revenues increased 9% to $3.65 billion, and adjusted operating income rose 16% to set an all-time quarterly record of $1.21 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased 18% to $739 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 28% to $1.55, also an all-time record quarterly result.","For fiscal 2013, revenues were $13.79 billion, down 1% from the previous year, and adjusted operating income rose 1% to $3.94 billion. Full year adjusted net earnings from continuing operations rose 2% to $2.32 billion, while full year adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 11% to $4.68.","Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong, and we remain steadfastly committed to our dual objectives, investing in everything we need to grow our content business and returning capital to our shareholders. In fiscal 2013, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. That includes the repurchase of nearly 70 million shares or approximately 14% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year and more than $550 million in dividends paid.","On our last earnings call, we announced an increase in the size of our share repurchase program from $10 billion to $20 billion. As we noted at the time, we augmented the pace of our buyback with the purchase of an additional $2 billion of our stock completed in the September quarter, which resulted in an aggregate repurchase of $2.7 billion in stock for the quarter. In the current quarter, we plan to return to a normalized buyback pace and purchase $850 million in stock. For the current fiscal year, we plan to purchase at least $3 billion of our stock.","Our results for the quarter are the capstone to a remarkable fiscal 2013 for Viacom with steady improvement as the year progressed. As always, Viacom's unwavering strategic focus is on content. We invest consistently in bringing more and more original programming to more and more screens to connect with audiences and fuel growth.","A year ago, we pledged to redouble efforts to return ratings momentum, and we delivered on that promise, particularly at our flagship networks, Nickelodeon and MTV. We invested more than ever in programming to fuel new hits, but we also conducted a thoughtful evaluation and evolution of our development, installing new programming leadership, honing our brand filters, diversifying our producers and creative partners, refining our scheduling and leveraging our audience connections across platforms in innovative ways.","In the September quarter, ratings were up year-over-year at nearly every network in our portfolio, including Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, SPIKE, CMT and Nick at Nite, among others. We made particular progress in growing range in those demos and dayparts where the opportunity for monetization is the greatest. On a revenue-weighted basis, ratings on our networks were up double digits. SPIKE notched its highest quarterly rating in nearly 3 years. MTV2 had its highest-rated quarter ever as it continues to evolve into much more than a flanker brand for MTV with successful originals including Guy Code and Wild 'N Out.","Nickelodeon achieved its greatest year-over-year ratings improvement in 16 years. In fact, October marked Nick's ninth straight month of year-over-year ratings growth. Nickelodeon's success is due to its balance of new original hits, including Sam and Cat, The Haunted Hathaways, Sanjay and Craig, Rabbids Invasion and the continued strength of established hits including SpongeBob and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A new Nickelodeon programming team has increased its output while maintaining a solid hit ratio.","Importantly, while we're seeing great ratings improvement, we've yet to see the full impact of this new generation of hits. As we launch more and more original episodes of these shows, we'll see even greater impact on our ratings across the schedule. And yet, Nickelodeon is keeping its foot on the programming pedal, aggressively green lighting a diverse new slate of series, increasing the volume in its content pipeline and building for the future.","At MTV, the network made a bold statement on the enduring power and cultural impact of its brand with the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, which attracted 10.1 million viewers and created a Miley Cyrus moment that is still reverberating across the pop culture landscape. MTV continues to build out a balanced schedule of originals including scripted fare like Teen Wolf and Awkward, reality hits including Catfish and Teen Mom and cost-effective utility series such as Ridiculousness and Girl Code that comprise the kind of diverse offerings that the millennial audience demands and advertisers love.","In fiscal 2014, MTV is ramping up to introduce a new wave of original content developed by its new programming team, including Generation Cryo, House of Food, Virgin Territory, Jerks with Cameras, and new scripted series Faking It and Happyland, and look for a special Miley weekend this quarter.","In fiscal 2013, across our networks, we executed against strategic priorities with great results, whether it was continuing to implement new brand filters and increase programming investments at CMT and SPIKE to drive ratings growth, reinvesting the BET Awards through the usually successful BET Experience, building a great bench of new young talent at Comedy Central with Amy Schumer, Nick Kroll, Key & Peele and more, or even establishing a strong new format at VH1 in rock biographical films with CrazySexyCool. We deployed our $3 billion investment in content in more new episodes, formats and genres, and the result is portfolio-wide strengths in programming and development that gives us a great foundation as we enter a new fiscal year.","Of course, we are aggressively monetizing this strength. For the September quarter, we grew domestic advertising by 10%. This is not only attributable to our ratings improvement but also to the efforts of our ad sales organization to build one of the most client-centric, solutions-oriented teams in the business. And networks are leaders not only in creating connected content across screens for audiences but also for advertisers. And we continue to enhance our best-in-class integrated marketing capabilities to meet ever-growing advertiser demand for custom marketing solutions that leverage our creative capabilities. While we are only halfway through this quarter, we currently anticipate mid-single-digit growth in ad sales for the quarter. This will lay the foundation for significant improvement in full year ad sales growth built in our programming rollout across our networks, our upfront calendarization and a steadily improving economy.","On the distribution side, the highlight of fiscal 2013 was our landmark multiyear agreement with Amazon to stream library content through Prime Instant Video. The agreement demonstrated our ability to collect significant value for our content through a new growing distributor but also to smartly orchestrate our content windowing so that we can do additional deals as new entrants come to market. At the same time, our biggest priority is to work with our cable, satellite and telco distributors as they innovate and bring new products to market.","Creating hits and driving ratings remains a priority. We continue to build on the current success of our channels, but we're also actively preparing for the future. Our audiences are driving the changes in content consumption that are reshaping the media landscape. We're positioning ourselves to capitalize on these changes across multiple platforms and devices.","This year, we've successfully launched branded channel apps for Nickelodeon, MTV, and very recently, VH1 and CMT. And we're launching apps for Comedy Central and Logo in the coming months. The Nickelodeon app has attracted more than 5 million installs alone, and each of the apps is garnering significant time spent and commanding premium CPMs. We're also experimenting in how we deliver content on these apps. For example, MTV recently released the complete season of its new series, Wait Till Next Year, on its app in advance of its on-air premiere. Much of the video we're delivering via app is thanks to our TV Everywhere agreements. 10 distributors currently support our authenticated apps and websites, and we expect to reach additional agreements soon.","Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions in Europe, we made several strategic moves in fiscal 2013 to position ourselves well for the international growth. We aligned our cost structure while launching a number of new channels, including the Paramount Channel in France and Comedy Central Asia, and taking full operational ownership of our MTV channels in Brazil, Russia and Italy. More recently, the 2013 MTV European Music Awards in Amsterdam on Sunday grew ratings in its key demo by over 40%, including big growth in the U.K., Italy and the host country of the Netherlands. The show also rated highly on MTV in the U.S. We will continue to expand our channel presence into 2014. The stabilization we are seeing in the European economy, coupled with our strategic development, should return us to a path for substantial growth in our international results.","In Filmed Entertainment, Paramount began its fiscal year with a very successful run of our branded film, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, which is well on its way to reaching $100 million in domestic box office. In fiscal 2013, the studio delivered strong performing new installments of its Star Trek, Paranormal Activity and G.I. Joe franchises and launched a new franchise in World War Z. We are very excited about Paramount's 2014 slate. It includes a diverse mix of films that underscores Paramount's commitment to serving all audiences. This includes established tent poles such as the upcoming Anchorman 2 and Transformers 4 next summer, as well as films this award season from Oscar-winning filmmakers including Alexander Payne's Nebraska and Marty Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, and after that, our proprietary franchise films such as Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones and Michael Bay's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Paramount has also established a lean television production organization that, together with its existing digital unit, will intelligently take advantage of growing opportunities for quality original content on a wide range of platforms.","To close, a great fourth quarter of substantial top and bottom line growth concluded a strong fiscal 2013 for Viacom. A year marked by reinvention and renewed ratings and operating momentum. We also continue to restructure our operations to find operating efficiencies. Savings achieved will fund our investment in people and technologies to drive us to an even brighter future as we control the growth of our overall expenses.","As we enter a new fiscal year, we will maintain our laser-like focus on investing in content, the lifeblood of our company. We will continue to innovate in developing new content, new marketing initiatives and new ways to reach consumers in more places on more devices. As we transform our company to take advantage of all the new opportunities for our content and our brands, we will steadfastly continue to make good on our pledge to return substantial capital and value to our shareholders.","Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentations summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results.","At our Media Networks segment, revenue in the quarter were up 7% compared with the prior year with domestic revenues up 8% and international revenues up 2%. Foreign exchange had a 1-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues. The increase in revenues in the quarter was principally driven by increases in advertising and affiliate revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.","Domestic advertising revenues were up 10% in the quarter, and international revenues were up 3%. As Philippe mentioned, Europe is starting to show signs of stabilization. In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 6% in the quarter while international revenues were up 4%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under digital distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits. Growth in international revenues was due to rate and subscriber increases.","Expenses increased 5% in the quarter. Within expenses, programming expense grew 6% while SG&A expense increased 4%. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation.","Media Networks adjusted operating income was up 11%, and the adjusted operating income margin was 42%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin increase was driven by top line growth of 7%, partially offset by 5% growth in expenses.","Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were up 11% in the quarter, principally due to higher home entertainment and ancillary revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.","Theatrical revenues increased 31%, primarily due to higher carryover revenues from the June quarter release of World War Z. Home entertainment revenues were up 24%, reflecting the strong mix of titles released in the quarter, including Star Trek Into Darkness, G.I. Joe: Retaliation and World War Z. TV license fees were down 17%, driven by the number and mix of titles available. Ancillary revenues increased 54%, primarily reflecting the Marvel distribution rights sales, as well as growth in the proportion of digital distribution revenues for key entertainment titles released in the quarter.","Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $291 million in the quarter as compared to $195 million last year. The increase principally reflects the profitability of home entertainment titles, as well as profits from ancillary revenues.","Now touching on corporate. Expenses increased $32 million in the quarter. The increase relates to higher deferred compensation costs related to the appreciation in our stock price, as well as higher incentive-based compensation cost. For fiscal year 2013, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.9%, reflecting a 110-basis-point improvement over the prior fiscal year's adjusted rate. The reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the mix of international versus domestic income.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thanks, Wade, and good morning, everyone. Let me talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover the seasonal factors impacting our 2014 fiscal year.","For the quarter, we generated approximately $1.1 billion in operating free cash flow and exceeded $3 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in operating free cash flow for the quarter was principally due to lower cash taxes and higher operating income. Cash taxes benefited from provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expenses, as well as from the timing of cash tax payments.","Now turning to our debt. For the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. On our last call, we indicated that we were comfortable returning to our target leverage ratio to the pre-recession range of 2.75 to 3.0x. Accordingly, during the September quarter, we issued a total of $3 billion in senior notes and debentures in a combination of 5-, 10- and 30-year maturities. We were able to issue the new debt at a rate commensurate with our overall cost of debt while at the same time extending our weighted average maturity.","In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 25 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.","As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $11.9 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, some of which will be deployed towards our buyback program. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8x. At September 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.","Our return of capital to shareholders continued in the September quarter. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $2.8 billion of capital back to our shareholders. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $850 million of our stock in the December quarter. Our capital return has been consistent. If you look back 3 years to when we started our current share repurchase program, our stock was trading at approximately $36. Since then, between buybacks and dividends, we have returned a total of $12 billion to our shareholders or approximately $20 for each share outstanding at the start of the current program.","If you go back to 2006, when the 2 companies split, we have bought back an aggregate of 336 million shares in the open market at an average share price of $47. At the end of September, we had 449 million shares outstanding. At our current buyback rate, we will purchase more than 10 million shares in the December quarter based on our current stock price. If you exclude the shares owned by National Amusements, we will have less than 400 million shares outstanding at the end of December.","Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting our 2014 fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, we continue to see growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to some digital agreements which are tied to product availability.","For the full year, we expect the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense to be in the high single digits. In terms of programming expense -- in terms of nonprogramming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.","For 2014, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refinance as we go through the year and get a better sense of domestic versus international profitability mix.","Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, we are currently in production in partnership with Warner Bros. on Interstellar, which is directed by Chris Nolan. Paramount has a number of animation projects in the pipeline with SpongeBob and Monster Trucks scheduled as the first films to be released under their animation label. And we are in development on a number of sequels including Mission: Impossible, Star Trek, G.I. Joe, as well as World War Z.","In summary, 2013 marked a year of accomplishments on several fronts. As we reinvigorated a number of our programming and development teams and increased our investment in original programming, we saw a turnaround in ratings at many of our networks. Our ad sales performance rebounded, and we achieved double-digit growth in our domestic affiliate revenue for the seventh year in a row. We leveraged this improved operational performance to return a record amount of capital to our shareholders.","As we look forward, our focus continues to be on creating content and experiences that engage our audiences on every screen. We are investing in our organization and our infrastructure in order to monetize our audiences as they embrace new platforms and new technologies. These investments are enabling us to create unique opportunities and additional value for our advertising and distribution partners.","With that, I will turn the call over to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I just have quick one for Tom and one for Philippe. Tom, just going back to what you said on affiliates for your guidance, what are you assuming for SVOD in this fiscal year? So you expect it to grow, stay the same or come on down?","Philippe P. Dauman","I'll take that question, Michael. The way we -- we don't break it out in a way we discuss our affiliate revenues. We have -- in order to get to our high single digit, low double digit, we have a lot of business in the house. So we have run rate of existing deals, both traditional -- so-called traditional and SVOD and other. And we obviously have renewals along the way. We make certain reasonable assumptions and new business that we are in discussions on. So we're very comfortable with the continuation of our high single-digit, low double-digit growth rate this year and actually in the years to come.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then I will go to you, Philippe, on international. This quarter was pretty good for international advertising growth. You talked about Europe improving. Was that one of the factors -- how important was Europe in driving this quarter's improvement and sustainability? We've heard a lot about easy Olympic [ph] compares on the continent. So when you look at the year ahead and kind of the trends you've seen in this current quarter, sustainability of advertising growth internationally, how do you feel about that?","Philippe P. Dauman","I feel that with the stabilization of the European economy and particularly in Continental Europe, the U.K. has actually held up reasonably well for us. We're seeing improvement. So we expect to see high single-digit growth in this quarter and international ad sales, and we expect to have a solid year for the full year and especially as a result of our continuing to expand our footprint in different parts of the world. So that will drive our growth not just this year but in the years to come.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I was wondering if you could talk through the role of digital advertising in the current quarter and just how traction is on apps, to what degree you see incremental revenues from that. Maybe relatedly, I'd love to hear your current thoughts on the state of measurement given the recent Nielsen and Google deal on OCR. And what do you think that advertisers are willing to accept in terms of the data you can provide in terms of first-party metrics?","Philippe P. Dauman","Let me take the question, and Tom can add to it as he wishes. We are -- as we launch apps, obviously, they serve 2 purposes. One, we are creating a lot of new content for the apps and as well as putting on some of our existing content. And we have the ability to sell advertising directly on that. So as we roll them out, as they expand, as usage increases, that will drive new ad sales. The second purpose of these apps is to support our business with all of our affiliates. And we are looking forward to more widespread rolling out of so-called TV Everywhere capability such that we will have more reach to our consumers. We'll be able to have linear viewing. We'll be able to secure better ratings. We'll be able to secure more engagements because of all the other functionalities that we'll have on the apps. We also look forward to our distributors inserting capabilities like digital ad insertion and the like. So there's a lot of opportunity ahead. On the measurement front, which will also drive the penetration of TV Everywhere capability, we are encouraged by a lot of the initiatives that are on place. And as we go forward and as we roll out this app capability, we will have the opportunity to combine sample type ratings with first-party data that we already utilize on our dot-coms, on our apps and mobile application as we go forward.","Thomas E. Dooley","Yes. Brian, there's a great deal of demand for digital video inventory that's based upon or delivered within professional -- professionally produced content, and we are enjoying the benefit of that demand as we continue to fill that pipeline with our great content. Also, as Philippe said, I think measurement is just beginning in terms of its evolutionary process. And as you get measurement down, you will evolve currencies behind that, and I'd say we're in the first or second inning of a 9-inning game on that.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Do you see that many advertisers are right now buying integrated packages right now? Or to what degree -- how common is that at this point in time? Or is it really standalone?","Thomas E. Dooley","The point that we see is that most of all -- almost all of our advertising is an integrated package because we have great demand from our largest advertisers to buy across the ecosystem.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions. I guess we'll jump balls. First, can you talk about the puts and takes driving December quarter domestic ad growth?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we have -- for this quarter, we have new programming rolling out as the quarter progresses, a lot of new series that are premiering, great lineup for Nickelodeon. It\u2019s going to have a huge Thanksgiving weekend with a lot of original premieres and movies. We see good volume in the scatter market to build on a good foundation that we obtained in the upfront market. By the way, as the year progresses, the calendarization of the upfront gets better for us. So we see optimism ahead for the year as we go on, and a lot of our new programming on some of our other networks such as MTV and BET and others are really kicking in as the year progresses. So we expect this quarter to be solid and the year to be solid.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Does that mean that there's a potential that advertising accelerates during the year?","Philippe P. Dauman","There's that potential.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then the second question is the 4Q '13 pulse noted domestic subscriber levels for your channels, including your mature channels, improved over the last year. So by our math, pay-TV video subs in the U.S. is essentially flat year-over-year. So first, did your internal results match what you're seeing from the Nielsen data reported in the 4Q '13 pulse? And is the high single-digit to low double-digit domestic affiliate fee revenue growth guidance reliant on subscriber growth at all?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, obviously some variability depending on subscriber growth. That's how we always state our range to be in the high single digit to low double digit. The number of subscribers is holding up reasonably well. We have some lag in our data based on the way we get paid. But it's holding up reasonably well. The mix of distributors is -- improves as our market share shifts, from our point of view, both in terms of the distribution scope of our networks with some of the distributors that are gaining market share, as well as terms. So yes, within that range, obviously, one of the components of improvement would be some growth in subscribers, but we're not dependent on that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted to probe a little bit more on the ad growth. You spoke to mid-single digits that you're seeing here in the December quarter from the 10% that you just put up. I was wondering if you can be more granular on why you see a slower trend in the December quarter than the quarter we just passed. Does it have something to do with the Olympics comps or something to do with categories? I mean, I think kid's movies were good in the September quarter, maybe not as good in the December quarter, so more color there will be helpful.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we -- yes, we think mid-single-digit range is good for this quarter. The last quarter really came on strong as the quarter ended. It's a combination of our having really strong ratings across the board and a few categories such as retail pulled up at the -- pulled into the September months, some of the advertising that they originally scheduled for the beginning of the fourth quarter. So retail would probably be a category I would highlight as want to get ahead of the game in their advertising spend. So overall, we see a healthy marketplace, and we're very optimistic. Obviously, we are counting on the economy, the general economy, to continue its recovery. If the recovery accelerates, that will also be good.","Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And you had very good ratings performance in the quarter. As part of your -- what you're seeing here, just an assumption maybe that these ratings performance doesn't necessarily continue or was there really anything that applies to that in the outlook?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we feel good about how our ratings will be over the year, particularly on a revenue-weighted basis, as we indicated in our remarks. We're very focused on where the revenues are across our networks, and we have, with the higher volume of programming that we're producing, more flexibility on how we schedule our programming. So we have enough in the pipeline that we can move things around and yes, really look for the opportunities where the monetization is best.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just staying on the strong growth that you saw in the September quarter, were there -- was it really driven by any, I guess, one network? Did one network start to stand out as sort of a bigger driver of that growth? And then second question is sort of the improvement at Nick at Nite, did that sort of broaden your advertiser base a bit? I mean, with the demographics being a bit older, are you finding yourself pulling in maybe some advertisers more traditional for broadcast?","Philippe P. Dauman","Really, the strength in the quarter was pretty much across the board in our networks. And obviously, when you compare the fact that Nickelodeon, all the Nickelodeon dial, Nick and Nick at Nite as you point out, the improved ratings clearly helped. But across the board, we had strength. And yes, Nick at Nite, along with TV Land and CMT, give us the -- and other dayparts in other networks give us the opportunity to capture some of the older demos to build on our strength in the younger demos. And we can pick up some off-broadcast ad dollars through that. So as our ratings grow or continue strong in those demos, it gives us the opportunity to gain market share there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vasily Karasyov of Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","My question is about Paramount. If we look at the full year results and compare it to the last few years, we do see that this year was below what we came to believe is the run rate profitability there. So I was wondering if you could talk about what made this fiscal year '13 different in the film studio and what kind of results should we be expecting going forward.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, Vasily, first, we're pleased with Paramount's performance during the year. And this was an unusually crowded tent pole summer where all the studios released a lot of tent poles. And so it's very competitive. And given that, our tent poles, Star Trek and World War Z, did quite well. And I think Paramount was probably unique in not having a tent pole that failed during the summer. So it was a very competitive year, particularly in the summer. In terms of availabilities, yes, we had lower television licensing revenues than we experienced in prior years, and some of that has to do with what our own availabilities are. Some of it has to do, again, with some softness in certain markets, particularly in Continental Europe. And we hope to see improvement in that area in this year. As I indicated in my remarks, we also have a particularly strong lineup this year, as cited in our releases. So we feel we're going to have a solid year at Paramount.","Thomas E. Dooley","And Vasily, as you know, Paramount has done a great job around the world in terms of JVs on its distribution infrastructure and to further really enhance the core structure of the Paramount group to be able to continue to grow profitability in the future.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant of ISI Group.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You guys talked about controlling costs apart from your programming costs increasing in the high single digit, can you sort of talk about some of the things that you've been doing to sort of reduce cost across both the film and the network side, automating the advertising process and showing distribution internationally? Where are we on that process? How much is left to be done there? And second, just quickly on cash in hand, given you're returning a lot of capital, what's the optimal amount of cash you should have on your balance sheet?","Philippe P. Dauman","I'll take the first question and leave it to Tom and Wade on the second one. Yes, we continue, throughout our organization, to look for opportunities to operate our company better. And operating it better involves both saving money by putting in software systems and other systems that make us more efficient, looking for opportunities to work with other partners. For example, we have, just very recently, in the Netherlands, entered into an ad sales joint venture with both Discovery and FOX, which will enhance the ad sales organization there both from a revenue side and a cost effectiveness side. So we always look for operational capabilities throughout the organization. In film, Tom touched on the distribution opportunity around the world. And we, together with other studios, look for more opportunities in more countries to do that as the overall output of these studios has diminished over the year, so it makes a lot of sense to combine infrastructure. And the other part of that, in operating the company better, is as we are doing that, we continue to invest in what we need to grow our business so that we can launch more apps, so that we can take advantage of the strong emerging opportunities in mobile video, and so we can take advantage of international development opportunities, taking control of Brazil and Italy and Russia and really expanding our footprint and our scale in those countries. So yes, that's a dynamic process, and we are -- we never stop on that. So we accomplished a lot, and we continue to look for opportunities. On the cash on hand?","Wade Davis","Yes. Cash on hand, Vijay, is in the area of $750 million to $1 billion would be sort of what I would call our optimal or average that we'll have at the end of any given quarter. That will vary, though, as of the end of this quarter with the borrowings that we've done and our net investment. Also, I mean, just to supplement what Philippe said, if you look at our capital expenditures, which is very modest and the majority of our capital expenditure goes into investing in information technologies that really are, on a global basis, driving down the cost of doing business at the company in terms of operating in business hubs on a global basis that support our diverse operations around the world that used to be supported by our operational facility that were diverse and dispersed in different markets. That is driving a lot of efficiencies and allows us, as Philippe said, as we expand into new markets, allows us to enter those markets with little incremental cost. So we think those investments have turned out extraordinary well, and the teams that have put those in place over the last several years have done a great job. And I think in terms of your runway to the future, I think there's significant additional opportunities both as we expand and continue to put more operations through those regional operational centers.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Janedis of UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Philippe, you talked about some of the new programming. Are your original hours increasing this year across the platform? And as you move to more originals versus licensed, how has cost per hour changed?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, yes, so the answer is we are increasing the number of original hours across the board. That's how we're applying incremental spending. We still are acquiring third-party programming, particularly for networks like TV Land and Nick at Nite. But original programming gives us the ability to build our brands better. It gives us programming that we can exploit through different platforms and new distributors. So it creates a lot of value for us. We look at a mix of original programming. So we have some low-cost, efficient programming that repeats really well. For example, Ridiculousness on MTV. We have -- we launched a new format on Comedy Central, @midnight, which has performed very well so far. And then we'll have, obviously, more expensive scripted series. So if you look at it on a blended basis and impact, we see that it is improving our overall results and we continue to look to drive our margins as we continue to invest in programming. And of course, original programming, the more original programming we have, the more distribution and ancillary revenues we have the opportunity to generate.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe somewhat related to that, as you know, there's been some concern in having some Nick programming available online is creating some ratings issues. You referenced the growth there. Are you at a point now where it's pretty clear that any shift in viewing is minimal? And are there any metrics you can share on that?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, in terms of the Nickelodeon programming, as you know, during the course of the summer, we shifted the Nickelodeon programming from Netflix to Amazon Prime. The impact was minimal when it was on Netflix. Given the narrower reach of Amazon Prime, while it's a very successful driver for Amazon Prime and it's a great partnership, there is significantly lower distribution than Netflix had. And for Nickelodeon content on Amazon Prime, it works really well for us because it's a great branded environment. We believe that we get discovery of our programming by new kids. And it helps consumer product sales on Amazon. So we manage that distribution to make sure we maximize our overall revenue and margin.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alan Gould of Evercore.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I've got a couple of questions. First, can you tell us what percent of your subs come up with new affiliate deals this year? And secondly, I believe we're coming up to the Hard Eight or the Hard Ten [ph], the big Nickelodeon selling season. I mean you probably have a pretty good idea of that. How is the kids advertising versus your overall advertising?","Philippe P. Dauman","Look, the way I would characterize our affiliate deals, the way we have our renewals lined up now, in any given year, we have under 20% of our revenues up for renewal. That's just the way we have staggered our deals over the last several years. And you can understand that we don't want to get more precise than that. And the overall ad market is shaping up well for us. Nickelodeon has great vitality. The programming is working. Our advertisers are really pleased with what Nickelodeon has done. And Nickelodeon will grab the overwhelming majority of the advertising money available in the Hard Eight and otherwise.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I wonder if you could just review where you're progress has been on your international margins and how you see that developing in 2014?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, Doug, 2013 was really a year which was difficult for us in Continental Europe. And we used that time to extend our footprint, as I mentioned before. And with the stabilization in Europe, we look to go back to growing our margins. Our objective is to get to the 20%-plus margins over time. We had hoped to get there by now, but with that setback it'll be a little delayed, but we will get there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","My question was mostly about international profitability as well, so I'll just ask maybe for a little bit more color by country, any ones that are maybe a little better than expected, a little worse and that we could maybe see pickup from?","Philippe P. Dauman","Again, U.K. has been a pretty solid market. We see great opportunities in Latin America, particularly now that we were able recently to take control of MTV in Brazil. And with that, we are already getting good distribution. We have more opportunities to expand with other networks. We are expanding the Paramount Channel across new territories. We recently launched it in France. France is doing better. Southern Europe, we see stabilization in Spain and Italy, again, with our taking control of the network. We see opportunity there. Russia, again, we were able to launch MTV. We have Nickelodeon distribution. So we see good growth ahead in the years to come. And the India joint venture that we're in continues to get stronger. We will add scale in India with our joint venture partners, and that continues to be a growing media market. And we are already creating significant value for Viacom today in India and will in the future. So really, I go across the world and I see a lot of opportunity over many years to grow our business, and we are committed to making our international networks business a very significant part of Viacom.","Operator","And we'll take our final question today from James Dix of Wedbush Securities.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions for you. First, any color you could give on the pricing you're seeing in your online video offerings. Or is it a little hard to tell because of your integrated packages? Any color you can give as to what growth you're getting from volume increases in online as distinct from other sources. And then secondly, just curious as to where you stand in terms of leveraging the data and analysis that you can get on your younger and more digitally savvy audiences in terms of programming development and marketing strategies. It seems to me that's a lot of opportunity for you over time to maybe improve your hit rate or lower your variability. But curious as to anything you're doing there that we should know about.","Wade Davis","Yes. James, the pricing in online, especially, as I mentioned before, in the digital video world, is at a premium to what we get in the linear world. It's a significant premium. And it's highly desired, especially when wrapped around the kind of content that we have. As far as data goes, data has become an increasingly important element in our toolset that we use, both in-house to identify targets and develop product, address our audiences. We have almost 140 million people in our database, IP addresses in our database, and we learn more and more about their preferences for shows and the kind of shows that they want to see on our air. And that has become an invaluable tool for us as we build out both the service functionalities we provide our advertisers and also the kind of content that we develop in-house for all of the core audiences that we serve. So that's really an exciting new area for us and many of the other media companies out there, and I think it's going to be a big change maker in the future that will drive both incremental opportunities on the cost side and also drive, I think, revenue opportunities for us to better serve our core constituencies.","Philippe P. Dauman","And James, to your point about programming development, we already see, for example, where we have -- apps are widely distributed like the Nick app where we have a number of short-form features on there. We obviously get to see what kids are picking, what they're interested in, really getting us to think about what kind of programming they might be interested in seeing. And it's a good way to experiment with fairly broad reach on what we're doing. And the same goes with some of the other creative initiatives that we have in our music networks where we're also trying inexpensive short-form content, some of which we will see develop into long-form programming on our television networks.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us in our earnings call.","Operator","And this concludes today's presentation.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our December quarter earnings call. Listening from Los Angeles is our Chairman Emeritus, Sumner Redstone, and joining us in New York are Philippe Dauman, our Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Philippe.","Philippe Dauman","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's first quarter results.","First, I want to thank my colleague, mentor and friend Sumner who is listing on the phone for his vision, his guidance and his inspiration all of which will continue to energize us with Sumner as our Chairman Emeritus. I am honored to be the new Executive Chairman of Viacom and I will do my at most to continue to drive Viacom\u2019s operations forward and restore stock to its proper valuation. But more on that later in my remarks, now let\u2019s take a quick look at the numbers.","In the first quarter revenues declined 6% to $3.15 million. Adjusted operating income was $839 million and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $470 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 9% with $1.18 per diluted share.","2015 was a challenging year for Viacom as it was for many in the industry. However, it was a watershed year in which we took many important steps to position Viacom for the future. We reorganized and refocused our organization increasing both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment production pipelines. We also stepped up our investment in data measurement and marketing expertise and fuels our growth in the most attractive overseas markets. And we did all of this while delivering record earnings per share in 2015 and the highest Media Networks revenue in our history.","As we turn the corner into 2016, the hard work and investment is bearing fruit. Let me give you few of the highlights. We have dynamic new leadership in our business units and several of our major networks including MTV and VH1.","Viacom\u2019s creative culture is stronger than ever. Our focus on original programming and rapid deployment is paying off. Existing hits such as Lip Sync Battle, Paw Patrol, Love & Hip Hop and exciting new programming like Game Shakers, Younger, Teaches and I love Kellie Pickler are continuing to attract valuable and devoted audiences.","In fact Viacom had seven of the top 20 cable series in the quarter. Most major networks have seen year-over-year rains improvement and that raining strength is driving advertising improvement. There will be more to come as the changes underway with Comedy Central and MTV kick in and the ad market continues to strengthen.","An enhance distribution ecosystem is coming together with strong upside for content providers. We are experimenting and reaping the benefits of increased consumer choice.","Our international business is a strong performer with great upside but remains underappreciated. We are expanding distribution, creating differentiated and popular content building on Channel 5 substantial success, launching the high margin Paramount channel its ever more territories and building our success in India\u2019s high growth market.","And Paramount is into its rebuilding process with the movie pipeline improving and TV operations off to a strong start. Already, we\u2019ve seen solid critical response in Box Office performance in the first releases and there is much more to come throughout the year.","Turing to the Media Networks, revenues declined 3% to $2.57 billion in the quarter including a 1% adverse impact of foreign exchange. Before we move on to discuss our advertising results in detail, I\u2019d like to spend a moment to discuss the wide ranging and innovation agreement with Snapchat that we announced this morning.","The deal is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it is indicative of the flexible of innovative approach we are taking to grow our digital and mobile expertise rapidly and at a global scale.","Despite of the deal, we will bring two new high profile channels to Snapchat discover, a Comedy Central international channel and an MTV channel in the U.S. These on top of our other successful discover channels make us one of the largest publishers on Snapchat discover. Importantly Viacom will also become the external ad sales representative for Snapchat\u2019s advertising inventory giving us the chance to offer even more value to our client.","In addition, validating the continuing cultural influence of our programming, Snapchat will increase the number of the life stories it publishes tied to Viacom\u2019s tent-pole events such as the VMAs, the EMAs, the BET awards and others.","Snapchat\u2019s immersive and extremely popular short for video platform aligns perfectly with our leadership in both premium long and short form story telling for these same audiences. This deal between Viacom and Snapchat is a major step forward in the evolution of the marketplace made possible by our shared focus on young audiences and Viacom\u2019s content expertise, proprietary targeting, custom marketing solutions, industry leading sales force and our global strength. It\u2019s a great partnership for both companies and it\u2019s indicative of motivation to come.","Looking back on the quarter, domestic ad sales declined 4% in the quarter, a substantial sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Continued ratings games based on the content investment we made over the last few years across our channel groups are driving us positive momentum. Most of our networks are performing well and are making meaningful contributions as audience is build.","Excluding the performance of Comedy Central and MTV, our domestic television ad sales growth was solidly positive. Once ratings in MTV and Comedy Central turnaround and that work is well underway, the rebound will be even more clear. And the rebound will be fueled by Viacom\u2019s continuing leadership in delivery of the most progressive and innovative solutions in the marketplace. We recently announced an update to our proprietary Echo platform which measures the effectiveness of custom creative social marketing campaigns will go to the upfront with expanding offerings in Vantage and clients are already embracing the new Velocity content network hardest saying Velocity\u2019s creative and production resources to create data driven branded content program distributed across social platform for advertising partners.","Domestic affiliate revenues were substantially flat in the quarter with positive organic growth offset by the timing of content available to certain digital distributors. Absent that impact domestic affiliate revenues grew in the low mid-single digits.","With the majority of our distribution agreements locked into long term deals, we had no large renewals in the quarter. However, we continue to work closely with these partners to develop new avenues for viewers to enjoy Viacom programming.","To date, our syndicated site synapse which 75% of the subscriber universe and in the quarter, we launched robust Apple TV ads for Nickelodeon, Nick Jr, Comedy Central and MTV and apps on Roku for MTV and Nick Jr.","Viacom is currently in negotiations to extend our distribution agreement with Dish with whom we have a long and productive relationship. We have entered into a short term extension with them as we hammer out the details of our long term renewal. There may be short term hiccups along the way, but we firmly believe that we will ultimately reach an agreement that will be productive for both sides.","It has a strong quarter for many of our individual networks, each of which has become more flexible, more aggressive and more entrepreneurial. It was greater sharing of strategies and best practices across the house which enhances our ability to make the most of the unprecedented amount of high quality original programming really out of app [ph].","Original programming is a key to reducing view fatigue, provides greater opportunities for advertiser integration brings value in secondary markets and reinforces our network\u2019s cultural impact at the virtual and the real work water cooler.","There is no better example of this in Nickelodeon our biggest brand. In the first quarter, Nick\u2019s ratings improved over the prior year and in the current quarter, we are looking greater games. Nickelodeon is the 2 to 11 leader in total day ratings and has been its nearest competitor for 26 week straight in this demo. In fact, Nick\u2019s lead over the competition continued to widen the quarter with Nickelodeon\u2019s 30% ahead of Disney and 78% ahead of Cartoon Network.","We had the number one and number two kids series in the quarter.

And next month, Blake Shelton will be hosting the Kids Choice Awards, Nickelodeon\u2019s most important tent-pole.","VH1 is another turnaround story that we\u2019re extremely excited about. Under new leadership, the network has reversed earlier ratings declines and that positive momentum is accelerating faster than any other Viacom brand.

BET remains a number one cable TV network amount African Americans.","We\u2019re proud of what the BET team has done and how quickly they are reaping the rewards of the targeted investments in programming if may. The best is yet to come at BET and we are looking forward to continue growth as the network continues its evolution.","Spike has a solid first quarter with premiers of Ink Master drawing higher ratings and the Bar Rescue franchise showing continued strength and growth.

The story of the daily show is strong with three consecutive months of growth with total views and video consumption including a robust three million full episodes starts each week across digital platforms.","Trevor Noah has proven to be a star and he will continue to build on a strong start especially with valuable young audiences across multiple platforms. Historically, the daily show sees double digit increases in a presidential election year, so we believe even better results are ahead.","On the soft spot in the schedule and ongoing consumption shifts to under measured platforms resulted in channeling radiance overall, but I have great confidence Comedy Central will overcome these issues. The recent renewals of Inside Amy Schumer and Broad City are continuing evidence of the network is on solid creative fitting and remains the first choice for today\u2019s hottest comedy talent.","We are already seeing a rebound, ratings in the second half of the quarter began to improve led by a new season of Workaholics and the series premier of Idiotsitter.

The network\u2019s new management is deep in a turnaround plan and has already green led several new series with fore slated for fiscal 2016. I have complete confidence that MTV is heading in the right direction.","Outside the U.S., our footprint continues to grow with launches of TeenNick in Italy, BET in France and Comedy Central is the Chez Republic and Norway. In addition, Viacom International Media Networks will be launching the Paramount channel in Italy at the end of the month.","Paramount channel continues to be a good, strategic business for us. It is already profitable and allows us to further monetize owned content and minimal incremental cost.","As you know, India has been an area of great focus and thoughtful investment for Viacom. It is the world\u2019s leading growth market and a country where we are growing our revenues and growing our share.

The telecast was a hit with critics and audiences and delivered more than 14 million life plus three viewers in the U.S.","Paramount is a very valuable and significantly undervalued part of Viacom. Its library of hit films, generate significant recurring income year after year. It has been from a historical standpoint and a brief income slump due impart to a recent low number of theatrical releases, which reduces the positive waterfall impact of prior year film releases. This will change, no that we are back on track to release approximately 15 high quality releases a year including numerous tent-poles.","At the same time, what is now a low cost startup television production operation will ramp up the profitability over the next few years. Once we get through this rebuilding process and related investment, we expect Paramount to pump out significant operating income and free cash flow in the years to come. At the same time, its content will provide the fuel for epics in the U.S. a growing number of Paramount channels outside of the U.S. and will serve as an important source of television content our media networks including Nickelodeon, Spike and MTV.","In conclusion, I want to address the speculation about Viacom and our future. Our outlook and the facts have been distorted and obscured by the naysayers, self-interested critics and publicity. We will not be distracted or deterred as we built for the bright future ahead of us. As Executive Chairman and CEO, I will continue to work tirelessly to secure that future and will leave no stone unturned at a tactically or strategically. Sumner and I have a more than 30 year history side by side building his media empire. He and the Board of Viacom believing in my abilities and my character have been trusted me with weighty responsibilities none of which are inconstant or incomparable.","My singular objective is to protect and build value for all of Viacom shareholders and in doing so for all the beneficiaries of Sumer\u2019s trust not only include that the sadness of this daughter but also those of her brother.","And finally let me be absolutely clear, I could not be more focused on getting Viacom stock price back to the much higher level and enjoy my leadership toward short time ago. No one should doubt my resolve or the resolve of our entire management team to making that happen.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Wade.","Wade Davis","Thanks Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website.","Now let\u2019s take a look at our segment results. At our Media Network segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 3% and international revenues declined 4%. Excluding a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 3% reflecting growth in advertising and affiliate revenues.","Page nine of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.

The decreases in programming and SG&A costs were principally due to the savings from our strategic realignment last year.","Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 4% for the quarter and the adjusted operating income margin was 41%. The decline in operating income was driven by the revenue decline of 3% partially offset by the 3% decline in expenses.","Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were down 15% in the quarter principally due to decreases in the theatrical and home entertainment revenues partially offset by an increase in license fees. Foreign exchange had a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth.","Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues declined 44%. The decline in revenues was due to lower carry of the revenues give the difficult comparison to the strong performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the December quarter of last year, as well as lower revenues from our current quarter releases.","Of our more significant releases, the Big Short and Daddy's Home were both released in December of this year compared to Interstellar which was released earlier in last year\u2019s December quarter.","Home entertainment revenues declined 24% reflecting lower carryover revenues due to comparisons to Transformers Age of Extinction in the December quarter of last year.","Revenue from license fees increased 25% primarily driven by the licensing of certain titles and subscription video-on-demand and television.","Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $146 million in the quarter, as compared to a loss of $60 million last year. The decrease in operating results reflects the timing in mix of the current quarter releases as well as lower contributions from prior period releases.","And moving beyond the segment results, the other items line reflects a gain of $2 million versus $18 million loss in the December quarter of last year. Last year\u2019s loss was principally due to foreign exchange.","In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8% reflecting a 50 basis point increase as compared to the prior year.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Dooley","Thanks Wade. I\u2019m going to our cash flow, our debt, as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2016 fiscal year that I\u2019ve already been discussed. In the quarter, we had a cash use of a $152 million which compares to $57 million of free cash flow in the December quarter of last year.","Page five of the web presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to higher working capital utilization and lower operating income. Working capital was negatively impacted by the timing of film receivables from home entertainment and television.","Moving on to our debt, it remains principally excrete with an average cost at the end of the quarter of 4.6%. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of total debt and $327 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.2 times. We have $368 million remaining outstanding of our 6.25% senior notes which mature on April 30th. We plan on paying these notes off.","Now let\u2019s turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenues, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuation according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements which are tied to product availability. With the fiscal year 2016, we expect growth in affiliate revenues to be in the low mid-single digit range.","For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits.","In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic international profitability mix.","At Paramount, we are excited about the upcoming slate including our summer tent-pole\u2019s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profits to be weighted to the back half of the year as the studio benefits from their summer releases.","Looking ahead of the studio\u2019s production and development pipeline, Paramount has just wrapped production on Jack Reacher 2. This month, this studio is commencing production on four major films. Scarlett Johansson's will star in Ghost in the Shell which is in partnership with DreamWorks. Baywatch starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron a new chapter in Vin Diesel\u2019s action franchise XXX 3 the Return of Xander Cage and the romantic thriller setting World War II which is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.","In the spring, the studio starts production on Academy Award winning film maker Alexander Payne\u2019s next movie called downsizing starring Matt Damon.","In summary, while last year, we experiences broad ratings weaknesses which have organizational and creative steps to address those challenges. The progress we began to see at the end of fiscal 2015 is continuing.","In the December quarter, six of our top ten networks are growth in ratings. In March quarter to date, we are seeing ratings growth for our overall portfolio of Media Networks. At Paramount, they have started the fiscal year with several successes at the Box Office. And we look forward to the summer tent-pole releases.","In terms of our international media networks, we are benefiting from our investment over the past several years and anticipate strong double digit growth in profit this year. The acquisition of Channel 5 has been an unqualified success and the continued launch of new networks in Europe, Latin America and Africa has enabled us to build and grow our scale in the most important developing and developed markets.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson","I was wondering if Tom following-up and then I want Philippe. Tom, I think in the last earnings call, Philippe stated that you guys expected high single-digit affiliate fee growth this year domestically, now you are moving to mid-single-digit, what factors drove that change in outlook and how impactful is S5 your change and thinking?","Thomas Dooley","Philippe is going to take that one Mike.","Philippe Dauman","Michael, good morning.","Michael Nathanson","Good morning.","Philippe Dauman","There is several different facts, there is availability of product for S5, we have a one off item this year which without going into it\u2019s a terms which I can\u2019t do, which involves harmonization of the AT&T rates to DirecTV as part of our end of last fiscal year or early this fiscal year renewal of the AT&T agreement. As I said that\u2019s a one off item and that\u2019s a factor in there. So as we turn into next year, I think we\u2019ll get to a more normal growth rate in affiliate revenue.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, and then Philippe, follow-up on the news of your appointment as Executive Chairman, we wonder if there will any change to strategies now that you\u2019ve combined CEO and Chairman, any change of strategies or leadership of the company or any asset mixes that may change with the change to you as Chairman?","Philippe Dauman","Look, yeah Sumner and I have been in harmony and how we pursue our strategy going forward, obviously as we all kwon, the world is changing, our specific industry is changing. We have taken a significant number of steps which I outlined in my remarks, I won\u2019t repeat it, to move into the future, to build the existing ecosystem, we finalize our brands grow internationally, grow on multiple platforms the Snapchat deal that we announced this morning is an indication. You will see more deals to come. As I said in my remarks, I will leave no stone unturned, I never have and I never will.","And our objective is to build value. We are building value for the long term. We are building value with a few to getting our - a better valuation of our stock in the short term. But we will not take actions that undermine that value and we believe there was consistency in leadership, consistency in purpose, driving our content around the world, across multiple platforms, finding new source of revenues in licensing, consumer products and other areas. We will get by come back to the growth that we all want to stay.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question, sir, from John Janedis of Jefferies.","John Janedis","Thank you. Philippe, in the past you\u2019ve talked about the line of site to flat ad growth, I just wanted to ask, based on what you are seeing today, has your confidence level changed and have you see a change in the matter of tone in the marketplace given the recent macro headlines?","Philippe Dauman","We\u2019re seeing strong demand in the scatter market and strong pricing. We are seeing pricing in the scatter market over the last upfront in the neighborhood of 20%. So that builds very well for the upcoming upfront with builds particularly well for us as the great progress that we\u2019re making across most of our networks which I believe will turn into virtually all of our networks in short order. We are seeing a great appetite for our leading Viacom Vantage, Viacom Echo and Viacom Velocity products. We are determined to get back to ad growth. We\u2019ve also looked at having a healthy environment for our marketing partners. As you know, we have taken down our ad load in several key time periods across several of our networks and that to some extend might have suppressed some of the short term advertising growth but it is healthy for us and will lead to very healthy return to ad growth as we improve over the back half of the year and into next year.","John Janedis","You talked about this on your prepared remarks, I mean in the under measured platforms, where is the industry in capturing rating in this platforms and are you still on target for the non-Neilson based advertising at 50%?","Philippe Dauman","Well that will be a particular driver on getting shall we say supplemental or differentiated currency for us. We\u2019ll be as we go into the upfront, we have a lot of as I said before, we have a lot of advertiser clambering to get involved with these products and we\u2019ll be able to engage with them more deeply. As you know in this year, we had ramped up to an 11 major advertisers, I said in the last earnings call, we expect that number to triple thereby representing a large portion of our advertising revenues as we go into next year as a result of the upfront discussions we\u2019re having. We\u2019re able to offer reach into other platform like Snapchat which we announced this morning. And we\u2019re also seeing some moves by Neilson to improve its measurements. We are seeing some competition coming up with the comScore and track combination, so all of these together will move toward better capturing the actual reach that our networks have.","John Janedis","Thank you very much.","Philippe Dauman","You\u2019re welcome John.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll go to our next question from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi thank you. Just my first question just following-up on your comments just now on the advertising market given the strength of the scatter you just stated in the fact that I believe you have more inventory available in the March quarter versus the December quarter I guess, any color of how we should think about sequential, further sequential improvement in domestic ad revenues in March?","And then my follow-up question is just on any update on the buyback given upcoming maturities, how should we think about use of cash?","Philippe Dauman","Thank you, Alexia. Yeah as far as the ad market again we\u2019re looking at the general health of our networks. You\u2019re quite right, we\u2019re seeing improvement. We do have some work to do in our Comedy Central and MTV networks, MTV in particular will take a little more time because the new managements programming will be kicking in later and that\u2019s going to be significant. It\u2019s still early in the quarter, we expect this quarter to be in the vicinity of where we are going to see some meaningful progress in the back half of the year with our objective by the end of there to be poised for growth and sustainable which is what we are looking for sustainable growth in advertising revenues.","As far as the buyback is concerned, you\u2019re right, now we\u2019re focused on strengthening our operations, we\u2019re paying down debt as Tom mentioned, we are not refinancing where we\u2019re paying off an upcoming maturity. We are committed to our investment grade rating. And in due course, as we have availability within that framework, we will move forward at the appropriate time in the future to utilize the capacity that we have in our buyback program.","Wade Davis","Like, just from that point of view, it\u2019s important to note that as we\u2019ve reduced unit loads at certain networks, the full benefit of the ratings up with that we\u2019ve realized gets offset by some of that unit load reduction. As soon as we get to a more comparable period, the benefit of the ratings increasing will start to flow through. And I think as we said, bring into positive ad sales growth.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Philippe Dauman","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Doug Mitchelson of UBS.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. I think one for Philippe, one for Tom. And Philippe, you mentioned a short term extension with this, so maybe short term hiccups and I wasn\u2019t sure to how to take that comment, so whether in Viacom or close or far part in perception of value of the networks, any further commentary there would be appreciated.","And Tom, just sort of following-up on the comments of the balance sheet and maybe would Philippe would jump on this. But give sort of the back and forth with some of the debt ratings, the environment the debt markets right now and the trends for the business, you start to rethink you know what a good target leverage for the company should be, as we thought to figure out when the company can go back on often, so share purchases, do we use sort of the prior guidance for balance sheet goals or should we think about it more conservative in the future sort of given the events for the couple of years? Thanks.","Philippe Dauman","Doug, if you could appreciate, I want to address in remarks that this issues given that\u2019s been so much in the public domain and I wanted to bring all of your up to date where we are. But beyond that I don\u2019t want to go beyond that because what\u2019s important is for us to negotiate constructively and productively and price it until we get to a deal. And there is always give and take and the negotiations and so I wouldn\u2019t take anything more than that for what I said in my prepared remarks.","Doug Mitchelson","When we think about you know trying to figure out what our own affiliate revenue estimates should be, should we look at your updated guidance for affiliate revenue as including something you sort of different for this or if you know once the Dish deal happens then maybe it will be feel sort of a further update on affiliate revenue?","Philippe Dauman","We are comfortable with the update that we - that Tom mentioned.","Doug Mitchelson","Okay.","Thomas Dooley","Doug, on our leverage target you know look, we want to be solidly investment grade as a company. As you remember back in 2008, 2009, we delivered the balance sheet relatively quickly that\u2019s due to the company\u2019s very strong free cash flow generation capability. We think we can get down into the ranges that leverage some of the rating agencies are looking for companies like ours operate within. And we\u2019ve had a stated target of 2.75 to 3.0 and we\u2019re going to operate within that metric and perhaps at the lower end of that metric and then we\u2019ll look from there where the operations are and the opportunities to buy back shares at that point.","Doug Mitchelson","Alright, thank you both very much.","Philippe Dauman","You\u2019re welcome Doug.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Greenfield of BTIG.","Richard Greenfield","Hi thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ve got two. The first one for Philippe, I just wanted to follow-up on what you said at the end of your prepared remarks, you know given the exceedingly poor performance of Viacom over the past several years on an absolute basis and even looking relative to your peers and what appears to be some significant management turnover. Just wondering if you could give us color on why that you are the Board\u2019s choice to be both Chairman and CEO, like what was it trade wise that the Board looked in you and said that was why, that was the right decision for Viacom?","And then two, looking at Comcast, they shifted several of your channels to a tier. You said I think publically that that was a violation of the contracts they had with Viacom, have you sued Comcast and is that a risk that other distributors could try to tier some of your channels? Thanks.","Philippe Dauman","Rich, first of all as far as the performance of Viacom, let me just challenge what you indicated. Viacom\u2019s performance was at the top, in fact we have five consecutive years of begin significantly beating the S&P and our stock performance. Clearly we have from that a lot in the last two and especially last year. Some of the decline was extenuated in the recent pass by a lot of noise that existed around us. And I think some people who have been buying the stock in that period are have the fore site to see through a noise. And I think we have outlined the steps we are taking, the forward looking steps we are taking and the progress we are making in several aspects of our operations.","And then I level it to the Board, I am gratify that the Board overwhelmingly supported me for the position. They know me, they know what our plans are strategic plans, they know what our operational plans, they endorse them, they have confidence and I will repay that confidence by producing the results without sharking our obligation to make the changes that are necessary to make Viacom the leading content company of the future. That is our objective.","As far your question relying to Comcast, yes, they have violated our agreements and we are going to not sit back, we have not filed a lawsuit against Comcast but we will preserve our rights as we go forward.","Richard Greenfield","And Philippe, could I just follow-up. I really appreciate your answers for those questions. What was the noise that you specifically are point out that obscures the underlying results, what are the key noise elements that we should all be focused on?","Philippe Dauman","Well, if you haven\u2019t been listening, you don\u2019t know what the noise is. I think it\u2019s obvious to everybody what the noise is.","We\u2019ll go to our next question operator.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Vasily Karasyov with CLSA.","Vasily Karasyov","Thank you. Philippe, you were talking about MTV and Comedy Central returning back to growth and I understood that was advertising revenue growth. So I was wondering from the rating standpoint, do we just need for the comps to get easiest on when the May, June time period or do you expect recovery before that and what were the tag, do you have enough programming to do that?","Philippe Dauman","Thank you, Vasily. Look, we are - let me take them in two parts. As far as Comedy Central goes, clearly we have a great creative output there, that\u2019s resonating with our audiences. We have a number of returning series that are coming on stream to add to what\u2019s already there. So I think we have a healthy pipeline of Comedy Central and I think overtime that will take care of itself. And it\u2019s very attractive programming that reaches young audiences attractive to advertisers.","As far as MTV goes, MTV is in more of a rebuilding mode. We have a new Head of MTV that started just a very few months ago, who has rehabbed his team, has as I mentioned in our remarks, Green let new series. We needed and need more programming on MTV. That will start kicking in overtime. We are accelerating the hearing of the shows that are already in production so that we can fill the schedule better. We are going to add new shows and that will just build on itself over the next several months and quarters. So it\u2019s a little bit of different exercise but I think the energy that\u2019s being applied to it, the new enthusiasm for it, the reaching out to more programming sources and more relevant programming sources is very encouraging and I feel very good about the future there.","Vasily Karasyov","Thanks so it sounds like Comedy Central is this fiscal year event and MTV probably just go \u201817?","Philippe Dauman","Well, I expect to see some improvement in MTV before we get to fiscal \u201817, but we can see the full impact of the changes into fiscal \u201817.","Vasily Karasyov","Thank you.","Philippe Dauman","You\u2019re welcome Vasily.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets.","Barton Crockett","Okay, great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to, focusing on one of the assets you said was undervalued and that is the film studio. You know if you look at the independent kind of smaller film studios that are publically traded, kind of premium multiples I think impart based on people\u2019s view of the value for library and you get some good disclosures there from people like Lionsgate run by a former colleague of yours which takes about $500 million of library revenues, nearly $200 million of library EBITDA, could you guys give us a sense of the library revenues in cash flow at Paramount presumably it\u2019s bigger and could you give us any way to kind of get a handle on the value and the cash flows from that?","Philippe Dauman","We don\u2019t breakout that kind of information, we haven\u2019t in our history also we have a different level of materiality for Viacom that it is for a Lionsgate. I think it\u2019s clear that there is a lot of value there and as I\u2019ve indicated before, we\u2019ve also used a library to build assets in our case using our channel distribution capability. I mentioned epics in the U.S. And the Paramount channels are really adding scale a new demographic reach for us in many, many countries around the world and still growing as the race performance is really strong. And it is really helping to accelerate the growth on our international business which is a really underappreciated story as I mentioned.","We are building very significant value there and you can even breakdown components of our international business notable India and see the important value creating that\u2019s taking place.","So Paramount as other studios have at various stages has had a little slumping in output on current production, but I have confidence in the team there. I like what I see in terms of development. And that will improve the overall results and of course add to the impressive library that Paramount has as we mentioned.","Barton Crockett","Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","And then we\u2019ll to our next question from Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.","Brian Wieser","Thanks to taking the question. I actually wanted to dive in a bit into the Snapchat relationship. I was curious if you could providing more details around how you are thinking about using the relationship, we\u2019d be selling Snapchat independent sales of TV of relate inventory as well or is it meant to be a more of a value add sales and how long do you expect this relationship to continue with them?","Philippe Dauman","As we discussed a multiyear relationship, we believe we are great fit and they believe they are great fit for us. We will be flexible and how we use the inventory either selling it direct, whatever it generates better value for both partners in this relationship is what we will do.","I don\u2019t want to tutor on horn but I think they saw in us by the most forward looking at sales organization out there, one with the kind of reach live events and other attributes of that marry well with what they are trying to do. And we look forward to being a very fruitful relationship for both of us.","Wade Davis","I just add to that Brian, it\u2019s a great deal for Snapchat, it\u2019s a great for Viacom but most importantly it\u2019s a great deal for the advertisers that we deal with because it provides them with a suite of products that will reach a very hard to reach audience and we\u2019re able to help Snapchat bundle together with our inventory to reach that audience and help advertisers reach that audience. I think it\u2019s a win, win, win for all three parties in the ecosystem.","Brian Wieser","Thank you very much.","Philippe Dauman","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And we will go to [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. So going back to Michael Nathanson\u2019s question earlier about through the affiliate sort of compensation, do you expect S5 in the fiscal year to be up, down, flat, maybe some magnitude you can give us?","Philippe Dauman","Now, I won\u2019t give guidance on that, but overall that S5 is a better growing part of our distribution ecosystem with of course radicchios and what we license, what the windows are in licensing. As you know we have content that moves around, has moved on historically among the various S5 providers, there are other that are immerging, we are talking to new potential entrance into the field and that\u2019s both domestically and internationally. So mange it all in a holistic way and we see that as one of the factors in driving our affiliate growth revenue going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you very much.","Philippe Dauman","Welcome. We want to thank everybody for joining us for the call.","Operator","And that does conclude the conference. We would like to thank everyone for their participation today."],"22189":["Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB) Q3 2012 Earnings Call August  3, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","James Bombassei - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Sumner M.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our CFO.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page #2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release and on our website.","And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.","Sumner M. Redstone","I'm really pleased to join you once again as we report Viacom's third quarter results. Viacom's Media Networks are vibrant, focused on developing exciting new properties, maximizing opportunities for our most popular programming, Paramount. We are also making smart, strategic and creative decisions, excellently adapting to the marketplace and providing its films with the best chance of success, But before the marketplace for entertainment content was challenging, it's dynamic and full of opportunities now more than ever. With an outstanding management team and a strong culture of reinvention and innovation, Viacom remains perfectly positioned to recognize and exploit these opportunities here and all over the world.","I could not be more confident about the future projects for Viacom. And with the lead strong leadership, we are committed, as always, to growing our business here and around the world and generating solid returns to shareholders year in and year out.","Now I'd like to turn this call over to the man I say is one of the wisest men I have ever met in my life, Philippe. And Philippe, by the way, has been a great warrior. The battle he conducted against DIRECTV was spectacular. I think that Philippe has the same passion to win that I\u2019ve always had. And take my word for this, in the long run, Philippe will win.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","Despite challenges, Viacom made solid progress on several fronts in the third quarter of our fiscal year. Our industry-leading brands continue to grow and evolve across platforms, as well as geographic and demographic borders. We continued our sustained investment in creative content, especially at Nickelodeon and other key networks, and we are seeing promising signs that this investment will bear fruit.","Our strong audience bonds and the breadth of our network portfolio were big factors, not only in our strong performance in the recent advertising upfront, but also in our successful, albeit unnecessarily noisy, completion of an extra long-term carriage deal with DIRECTV 2 weeks ago. The DIRECTV deal keeps us firmly on the path to generate sustainable, high single to low double-digit annual affiliate revenue growth.","We are also now heading into a period where we will see growing results for our investments in international channel launches and consumer products initiatives. At the same time, Viacom's bottom line benefited from our relentless focus on operational efficiency. This tight rein on costs also serves to fortify our already strong balance sheet. As a result, Viacom remains a reliable generator of significant free cash flow even in challenging times. And we consistently make good on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Through this unwavering strategic focus, Viacom will generate significant long-term value for our shareholders.","This morning, I will provide an overview of our financial results for the third quarter and review highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will give additional color, and then we'll take your questions.","Let's begin with the numbers. Viacom's revenues decreased 14% to $3.24 billion in the third quarter, driven primarily by the mix of our Filmed Entertainment titles and lower advertising revenues. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% to $903 million. In our Media Networks segment, revenue declined 5% and adjusted operating income declined 10% due to lower advertising and ancillary revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues decreased 29%, reflecting the number and mix of releases in the June quarter in comparison to the same period last year, which featured substantial theatrical hits, including Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Super 8, Marvel's Thor and DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda 2. Adjusted operating income in Filmed Entertainment decreased $3 million, reflecting the revenue decline and substantially offset by lower expenses. Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations declined 12% to $512 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 2% to $0.97 in the June quarter. Foreign exchange negatively affected earnings per share by $0.02.","In the quarter, Viacom announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share. Last week, our Board of Directors declared our next quarterly cash dividend to be paid October 1. The company also repurchased $700 million in stock under our share repurchase program in the third quarter, and we expect to buy back $700 million in stock this quarter, for a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year.","Let's move on to highlights in our divisions. Our Media Networks experienced some cyclical rating softness that we are well equipped to overcome, as we have demonstrated in the past. More than any other programmer, Viacom's networks are built for reinvention, powered by our $3 billion investment in content this fiscal year. Our networks each have clear, established brand filters, to which they are introducing more and more original content. From BET to MTV to most recently VH1, our brands are consistently able to evolve with audiences, create hits and capture the cultural conversation. For example, 50% of VH1's current primetime schedule consists of returning hits, the highest percentage in 4 years, and the networks hit ratio was up 22% of our fiscal 2011.","Domestic advertising revenues decreased 7% due to the timing of 2 key award shows, as we previously signaled in our second quarter earnings call, as well as rating softness at certain networks. This year, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards aired in the second quarter, and the BET Awards aired early in the fiscal fourth quarter. Both aired in the third quarter last year, resulting in difficult year-on-year quarterly comps.","Worldwide advertising revenues decreased 9% for the quarter due to softness in Europe. As I mentioned earlier, we concluded the June quarter by successfully completing our upfront negotiations. We are very pleased with the outcome. Despite ratings issues in Nickelodeon, we were able to maintain the same share of the kids' upfront volume as last year. Overall, our total upfront dollars were more than $2.8 billion, up from last year, and we secured solid mid-single-digit increases in pricing.","Looking at the current quarter, while it is still early and difficult to predict, we are tracking to sequential improvement in domestic advertising revenue performance. In distribution, domestic affiliate revenues decreased 1% in the third quarter, which primarily reflects the significance of additional distribution revenues recorded in the same quarter last year. Worldwide affiliate fees increased 1%. As we have discussed in the past, revenue recognition requirements relating to digital sales create bumps in our usually steady affiliate sales growth path. If you exclude the impact of digital distribution agreements, our domestic affiliate revenue growth was right on target in the high single digits. In its fourth quarter, domestic affiliate revenue growth will be in double digits.","Throughout the quarter, we continued to deepen our partnerships with our distributors on existing and emerging platforms. Notably, we increased distribution for a number of our HD simulcast, while also completing an agreement to make our programming available through Time Warner Cable's in-home streaming app.","As noted earlier, in the current quarter, we successfully completed a challenging renewal negotiation with DIRECTV, striking a long-term agreement with an initial rate increase of significantly more than 20% and healthy annual increases in excess of those we had in the expired deal for the remainder of the 7-year term. In fact, the deal we ultimately signed was materially better for Viacom than the deal that was on the table at the time that DIRECTV made the unfortunate decision to drop our networks. In addition to rate increases, we secured increased or new distribution for Nicktoons, Tr3s and several HD channels. We secured a long-term commitment from DIRECTV to distribute our channels in Latin America via PanAmericana and Sky Brazil. And we forged a long-term agreement for DIRECTV to continue to offer Paramount films on Pay Per View.","In short, we are extremely pleased with our DIRECTV agreement and only disappointed that so many of our viewers were deprived of their favorite channels for 9 long days. We certainly hope this will be the only blip in what had been until now, in my 6-year tenure, our perfect record of completing affiliate renewals with every other distributor in the U.S. or elsewhere without disruption to customers.","Also notable in the quarter, our continued strategic moves to expand our consumer products business. In the past few weeks, the first toys and merchandise based on Nickelodeon's forthcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series debut on shelves at Toys \u2018R Us. The line of action figures, vehicles and more will be available in its entirety across all retailers this month in advance of the much-anticipated series premiere in September. Products for Nickelodeon's Winx Club have also begun to roll out and will continue to hit retail stores into the fall.","Additionally, COMEDY CENTRAL recently launched COMEDY CENTRAL Enterprises, a new division that will unite and grow the network's ancillary revenue businesses, including consumer products, home videos, CDs and digital downloads, publishing and live touring for its roster of stand-up comedians.","MTV is focused on programming innovation as it continues to diversify its slate with new scripted and reality series that's built on a strong base of returning hits. In the third quarter, those hits included Teen Mom, which was the #1 cable series in the quarter in the key 12-34 demo; Teen Wolf, which was up 6% year-on-year in the quarter and Jersey Shore spinoff, Snooki & JWOWW, which was #1 in its time period across television and the demo.","In the new fiscal year, we'll start with a new season of Jersey Shore. In addition, MTV will introduce a range of reality and docu series, including Catfish, The Heights and Wait Till Next Year, as well as new scripted comedies, The Inbetweeners, Underemployed and Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous. In addition, Teen Wolf and Awkward were recently renewed for third seasons for double their original order of episodes.","On COMEDY CENTRAL, Tosh.0 and Workaholics delivered solid performances in the third quarter, as each returned with new episodes. This fall, COMEDY CENTRAL hits the campaign trail hard with election coverage from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which remained dominant in late night. In fact, The Daily Show is the #1 late-night show in all of television with adults 18 to 49. The Daily Show and Colbert are the only 2 late-night shows to grow their viewership in the demo this broadcast season, while Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert will remain with COMEDY CENTRAL, thanks to recent contract extensions. Beyond the campaign blitz, COMEDY CENTRAL will debut Daniel Tosh's new animated series, Brickleberry, along with new seasons of Tosh.0, South Park and Key & Peele this fall.","Despite rating softness, Nickelodeon had success with new episodes of iCarly and SpongeBob SquarePants and the original TV movie, Rags, which reached 14 million total viewers. In the current quarter, the network is beginning to show momentum. Nickelodeon premiered a new SpongeBob special, Super Spongy Square Games, on July 22 with average 3.7 million total viewers. Following the episode, Nickelodeon gave fans a sneak peek in an upcoming series, You Gotta See This!, and the episode retained the overwhelming majority of the SpongeBob audience, including 99% of teens 9 to 14. A bright spot for Nickelodeon has been its new hit game show lineup. Figure It Out premiered in the third fiscal quarter with new episodes averaging 2.2 million total viewers. And Splatalot was added to the schedule in the current quarter, which is retaining 99% of the kids 6 to 11 audience from its Figure It Out lead-in. Splatalot is also showing solid time period gains over the months prior.","In addition to new programming, we're aggressively fine-tuning the schedule to drive viewership, which is resulting in significant time period gains for a number of Nickelodeon's signature series. The recent SpongeBob special posted big gains in its time period versus a year ago and the month prior. Big Time Rush is averaging 2.2 million viewers per episode this quarter, up double digits in all key demos versus a year ago. And just last Saturday, the new -- the newest Fred movie, Camp Fred, averaged 3.5 million viewers and ranked as the #1 cable telecast for the week for teens 9 to 14.","As we've said previously, Nickelodeon is debuting 650 new episodes of original programming for the upcoming broadcast season, including more than 130 from October to December. And just today, Nickelodeon is announcing a programming slate of 14 new series, TV movies and pilots, adding live-action and animation. As we have continually seen, fresh content drives renewed and expanded engagement, particularly among young viewers. Nickelodeon is now poised for an upsurge and soon. That includes the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on September 29; new episodes of animated series, including SpongeBob SquarePants, Kung Fu Panda and the Penguins of Madagascar; new episodes of live-action hits, including Big Time Rush, Victorious and the final season of iCarly; and great-event programming, including Worldwide Day of Play, The HALO Awards and a SpongeBob Christmas special.","This fall, Nick at Nite will premiere See Dad Run, a new family comedy starring Scott Baio. Nick at Nite has gained recent momentum from Friends, which is seeing a 6% increase in ratings year-over-year. Also this fall, the NickMom nightly programming block, which is being enthusiastically received by advertisers, will debut on Nick Jr. with 4 new original series.","BET continues to serve African-American audiences with a dynamic mix of scripted originals, including The Game and Let's Stay Together; big-event programming, including the BET Awards; and reliably strong unscripted series, including 106 & Park and Sunday Best. The Game and Let's Stay Together continue to anchor BET's primetime lineup as the #1 and #2 original sitcoms on cable. BET also has several original scripted and unscripted series debuting in the coming year, including sitcoms Second Generation Wayans, featuring the next generation of the Wayans family; and new late night series, Don't Sleep, hosted by journalist, T.J. Holmes.","VH1 is successfully broadening its creative mission with a wide variety of programs and formats for the network's adult-stirred target audience. In the third quarter, VH1's primetime range were up 22%, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year primetime growth in its targeted adult demo. Looking ahead, the network has a significant number of returning hit series, including Rehab with Dr. Drew, We Have Adopted Drew [ph], T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle and Pop Up Video.","TV Land also has a lot to look forward to, with its hit tandem of Hot in Cleveland and Happily Divorced set to return with new episodes this fall. Just last month, Hot in Cleveland was picked up for syndication by local TV stations, serving 65% of the U.S., including 9 of the top 10 markets.","SPIKE continues to broaden its audience, expanding and diversifying its original programming with a male-skewing general entertainment filter. In the third quarter, Season 2 of SPIKE's original hit series, Auction Hunters, attracted about 1.8 million viewers on average. The network also debuted the new series, American Digger, to an average 1.1 million viewers. In October, SPIKE will look to ink big ratings with the premiere of Tattoo Nightmares from Jersey Shore creators Sally Ann Salsano and Season 2 of the hit series Ink Master, hosted by Dave Navarro.","CMT's standout performance in the third quarter came from the successful 2012 CMT Music Awards, which attracted nearly 3 million viewers. The network also continues to break through with new episodes of its hit series, My Big Redneck Vacation, and its first reality competition series, Redneck Island, which debuted in June.","Moving onto international. We continue to see some softness in the international economic environment, particularly in Europe. However, strong affiliate growth from both digital distribution and organic growth, combined with strong cost management, offset lower advertising ancillary sales in the quarter.","We continue to expand the regional success of our adult-focused business internationally, as ratings for COMEDY CENTRAL improved 27% across the board; with double-digit increases in markets, including the U.K, Germany, Spain, Poland, The Netherlands, Sweden and Hungary. The Paramount Channel performed very well in its first quarter on air and signed 120 advertisers in its first 3 months of operation despite tough economic conditions in Spain. Nickelodeon also saw ratings improved by about 5% internationally. And in an effort to drive popular content in new audiences around the world, MTV's Jersey Shore began MTV U.K.'s Geordie Shore, which is enjoying its highest-rated season so far and remains the highest-rated series in the network's history. The series is a bona fide international hit, attracting big audiences in all the other countries where it airs, particularly Spain, Australia and Ireland. Despite difficult economic times, we continue to invest. COMEDY CENTRAL is fast becoming our third global brand, and we plan on launching at least 5 additional Paramount Channels in 2013.","Let's turn now to our Filmed Entertainment division. Despite a very different mix of films in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and the blockbuster-heavy comparable quarter last year, Paramount saw success with Titanic 3D, which has grossed more than $300 million in worldwide box office to date; and DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. Paramount remains on a great long-term creative path with a nimble approach to distribution, while it help give its releases maximum visibility, both in the U.S. and abroad. For example, the studio moved G.I. Joe: Retaliation out of this summer's crowded field to March 2013, allowing for a 3D conversion of the film and potential entry into the newly expanded Chinese marketplace. In addition to carefully calibrating its release strategy, Paramount continues to judiciously manage costs and effectively reduce overhead.","To conclude, the Viacoms stood firm in the third quarter of our fiscal year, confronted challenges and again delivered value for shareholders. As we move forward into a fall season that we'll see an influx of new original content across our networks, we will continue to strengthen our audience connections, giving us to a strong path to drive ratings and revenue. We'll continue to put our theatrical releases in the best possible position to succeed at the box office by aggressively pursuing new opportunities as they arise. We will operate with an unflinching eye toward operational excellence, capturing efficiencies and managing costs. And as always, we will continue to aggressively return capital to our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy.","James W. Barge","Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly.","This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's June quarter exclude $11 million of discrete tax benefit.","Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues decreased 5% to $2.3 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues declined 5%, and international revenues were down 7%. Foreign exchange had a 4-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues.","Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 7% in the quarter. International advertising declined 18%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 6 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter, as well as softness in parts of Europe.","In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues decreased 1%, while international revenues increased 10%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 4 percentage points. The decline in domestic affiliate revenues reflects the greater availability of programming associated with the digital distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year, partially offset by great increases in the June quarter of this year. Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreements, rate in subscriber increases and new channel launches.","Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 14% in the quarter, primarily due to lower consumer product licensing and Home Entertainment revenues. Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $934 million in the quarter decreased 10% as compared to the June quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 200 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease in margin was driven by the top line decline of 5%, partially offset by a 2% decrease in expenses.","Within expenses, programming expense grew 6%, while SG&A expense declined 9%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense, savings realized from our 2011 restructuring, as well as lower advertising and promotion expense primarily related to the timing of award shows.","Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 29% to $1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 52% to $283 million in the quarter. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to lower revenues from the current quarter's releases. The June quarter of this year had 3 releases as compared to 4 releases in the June quarter of last year. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased 8% to $304 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter. The TV license fees declined 24% to $315 million. The decrease in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in network TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 44% to $104 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher digital revenues.","Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $46 million in the quarter as compared to income of $49 million last year. Moving below operating income, total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thanks, Jimmy. I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year.","In terms of our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $197 million in operating free cash flow in the June quarter compared to $369 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to lower operating income and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower working cap utilization. The increase in cash taxes paid was due to the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to film and TV production.","As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter-end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress on lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter-end.","During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rates in the public markets to maintain our leverage and our target level. We issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in 2022, and an additional $100 million of 1.25% senior notes due in 2015. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.2 billion of debt and cap leases outstanding and $774 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 11x.","In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $833 million of capital back to our shareholders in June -- in the June quarter. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately 700 million of our stock in the September quarter. So for our fiscal year, we will have returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion to our shareholders, which is a return on market cap of 14%.","Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. As for our affiliate revenue, we are confident in our ability to grow these revenues in light of our recent renewal with DIRECTV. In the September quarter, we expect that domestic affiliate revenue will grow double digits, taking into consideration both the impact from the DIRECTV rate increase and the blackout period. Additionally, domestic advertising in the September quarter will be impacted by the blackout. This will reduce the domestic advertising growth rate by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter.","At Media Networks, we expect that programming expense will increase approximately 6% for the full year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to evolve our business model to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to enhance our margins.","In the September quarter, Filmed Entertainment revenues will face difficult comparisons to last year's theatrical and home video performance of Transformers 3, as well as the theatrical performance of Captain America. However, the studio should generate profits comparable to the September quarter of last year, as it benefits from the carryover performance of prior quarter theatrical releases and the availability of film titles in the TV marketplace, as well as lower overhead costs.","For 2012, we continue to forecast a book tax rate of 34.5%. As for our stock buyback program, we are on track to repurchase 2.8 billion for fiscal 2012.","Looking ahead at the studio's slate and the development pipeline, in October, they'll release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. In November, the studio will release Flight, directed by Academy Award winner Robert Zemeckis and starring Academy Award winner Denzel Washington. In November, Paramount will be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. For the Holidays, Paramount will release Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the bestselling book series.","As we look into 2013, the studio will be releasing sequels to existing franchises, including G.I. Joe: Retaliation in March; and the next installment of Star Trek, directed by J.J. Abrams, in May, both of which will be in 3D. In June, they'll release World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt. Looking at Paramount's developments, they have started production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Russell Crowe; and soon, they will begin production on the new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role. Paramount is also in development on the Nickelodeon-branded Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, which is being produced by Michael Bay; as well as on a sequel to Anchorman, which will reunite the original cast.","In summary, we remain focused on growing our businesses organically and using our free cash flow and the incremental capacity generated from our balance sheet to return capital to our shareholders. While we have experienced rating softness, we remain committed to investing in our brands and increasing the level of original programming on our networks in order to strengthen their competitive position. We continue to be encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises on both traditional and digital platforms. The ability to secure long-term growth in our affiliation agreement and the opportunity to grow our international profitability and to develop global franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth. We believe our focus on organic investment, combined with disciplined management of our core structure and an aggressive capital return program, will drive value for our shareholders over the long term.","I want to thank you for listening. And now we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have one for Philippe and Tom and then one for Philippe. For the jump ball, you guys are pretty clear about giving us next quarter guidance on a affiliates see [ph] growth double digits. I wonder, knowing what you know now, all those you've done, looking to next fiscal year, do you think that double-digit run rate continues for the next fiscal year on domestics x digital? So could just comment about that for a second?","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, Michael. We -- our guidance in general is high single-digit to low double-digit. We have confidence in that in the next fiscal year and beyond, based on agreements we've done, including the most recent one. We've tended to produce, on an annual basis, double digits, but we like to maintain our guidance of high single-digit to low double-digit. Of course, we've never delivered double digits. If the economy picks up, that'll also help us in that regard with more households subscribing to television.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","But I guess the run rate in the fourth quarter should be -- is there anything different about the rest of the -- the next few quarters after the fourth quarter run rate? That's the question.","Philippe P. Dauman","We're well on track for very high single digits, low double digits on a pretty -- on a consistent basis, annualized. Again, with the quarterly fluctuations that can be associated with the digital distribution deals, which of course, are -- require revenue recognition in quarters, so that's the only aspect that creates variability quarter-to-quarter. But we have strong affiliate revenue growth ahead on both the core and -- plus the continuation of the digital distribution.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess one for you. You're pretty patient on this, but -- and I hate to ask you because it involves people's lives, but at what point does the question about ratings become an execution question and there's, perhaps, a change in leadership at the different networks? So at what point do you look at the personnel you have and say, \"Look, it's not about the -- it's about the decision-making and not the funding or the schedule.\"?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we're very -- obviously, very, very focused on ratings issues, and it does go through cycles. And we have great leaders in our company. We have made a lot of changes in the programming departments across several of our networks, and we continue to reinfuse talent, promote talent. We've gotten into a lot of new genres at several of our networks. And we also have reached out very significantly to the outside production community in a significant way. There's a very intensive focus on content. That's what we do. And we have a culture of accountability, and we have been implementing that at the many layers of the company. And I'm confident that -- we have steps we are taking. And if you look at Nickelodeon, for example, we're really now starting -- beginning to see the fruits of what we're doing, and we have a very strong lineup coming, coming forward. I should point out, by the way, that some of our Nickelodeon brands are doing extremely well, like Nick Jr. and Team Nick [ph], the ratings are up. If you look at Nickelodeon Family, we've been moving forward. And we will -- we're also looking at how we schedule shows and what networks that will appear in. And we are aggressively pursuing this at all levels.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, just on ad trends. The comment about you're seeing sequential improvement, is that fair to say that you're seeing sequential improvement even after adjusting for the BET Awards? I think last quarter, you said that you've got a 300- to 400-basis-point negative impact in the fiscal third quarter from the loss of both events. And I think you said it was evenly split, so I think somewhere around the 150 to 200 basis points should already be helping you by having that event in the fourth fiscal quarter. Are you still seeing improvement on top of that? And then just looking at the DIRECTV battle and how that played out, how has it impacted your view on either licensing to new kind of facilities-based distributors, such as Google, or even the emerging kind of over-the-top MVPDs? Does that become more important when you look at the battles that you've just had?","Philippe P. Dauman","Thanks for your questions, Rich. As far as the ad trends, the way I look at it is that the advertising impact of the blackout, the DIRECTV blackout for those 9 days, as Tom mentioned, that impact kind of offset the BET Awards. So they canceled each other out. So we see, right now, 1 month into the quarter, and we see sequential improvement taken both into account. But they basically cancel each other out, so core sequential improvement is what we see at the moment. Obviously, we have a couple more months to go in the quarter. As far as DIRECTV, as I said, this was not -- we hate to see a blackout occur. It's never -- shall never occur in all the other renewals we've concluded. We look at distribution in a holistic way. We value all of our distribution partnerships. We evaluate what we -- what content we put on new -- so-called new distribution, additional distribution. Mobile is also emerging. And we're fairly agnostic on what foreign distribution takes as long as it's added into our business and additive to all of our partners. But -- and we've managed that pretty well so far there, and we'll continue in the path we are on. The DIRECTV renewal, which is now history, it's behind us, doesn't impact our strategy as far as that goes.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow up on the first question, given all the programming investments you've made, would you be significantly disappointed if you didn't drive advertising revenues up for fiscal '13, given what you talked about from an investment standpoint?","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, obviously, that's subject to 2 things, right? One is the general economic conditions and how that impacts the general advertising market. But I certainly expect, given our intense focus and our investment program, I shall expect to see year-on-year ratings improvement at those networks which were deeply affected this year. And so I'm confident we'll get there and that will help drive advertising improvement.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","2, I guess, Philippe and Tom. Philippe, any update you can give us on the percentage of Nickelodeon viewing that's coming from Netflix would be interesting. But mostly, interested in any updated thoughts you have on the investor concern around kids' viewing movies online and how that might impact the company. And for Tom, you've been working hard to manage SG&A and offset the impact of some ratings softness this year. I think margins are coming at about flat for fiscal '12. So for cable networks, I guess, one, is that right? Is that more to do in the cost side? Or has the low-hanging fruit been captured?","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you, Doug. I'll take the Nick question. The Nick viewing on Netflix has been pretty stable. As we've talked about before, there's really no significant difference, and I've spoken before about my perception of that impact. We clearly have to be where consumers are and where they are. That's why we do -- we are rolling out apps with our -- in partnership with several of our distributors. You'll see more of that in the fall. We already have it at -- with distributors like FiOS, you'll see it in Time Warner Cable, you'll see it at some of our distributors, so that our audiences can view the on-demand content, they\u2019ll be able to view Linear in the home. Eventually, when we have measurement [ph] and other issues sorted out, they'll be able to watch it out of the home on various devices. So yes, we're very anxious to deliver content to our audiences wherever they want to view it. And I think we're -- we'll soon be able to monetize more effectively the viewing on these other devices.","Thomas E. Dooley","Yes, Doug. We're very focused on -- of course, as you guys know, I mean, the reason our margins haven't grown more than they have this year is because of the rating shortfalls and -- which has decreased the revenue growth that we have projected. Once we get the revenue to grow back on track, I think you'll get very good dramatic expansion in our margin that was continuing right up through second quarter of this year. And we feel pretty confident about that. And we've got plans in place, and we've begun process and even made investments in our systems across the company, which are -- will begin to pay dividends in the next quarter and certainly in '13 and '14. So we feel pretty good about being able to both control the cost growth factor and really find new efficiencies throughout the P&L in operations.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm sure you didn't expect the first 3 questions head this way, but we're talking about 10% affiliate revenue ad growth and margin expansion next year as we sit here today.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask 2 questions: maybe one on the Nick Upfront and the other on EPIX. On EPIX, can you just sort of comment on the DIRECTV terms or at least what the EPIX situation? I think the announcement was that they have the option to carry EPIX. Maybe add just a little more detail on whether you expect them to or not. And then you have Netflix. I think the over-the-top exclusivity expires this month or very shortly. What's your expectation there? Do you expect ending up going out and shopping that to other online providers? And give us a sense for what you think the opportunity is. And just on the Nick Upfront, it's such a big part of next year. You guys had the view that Nielsen had a lot to do with the ratings declines. I'm just wondering if you were able to sort of guarantee quite a bit of ratings improvement, at least flat or maybe even up, looking out because you start to lap that panel change and how that might have fit in to the overall Upfront. Just trying to get a sense for whether Nick can grow next year or if the Upfront results, given the ratings declines last year set you backward, that's going to be pretty tough?","Philippe P. Dauman","Thanks, Ben. So starting with your EPIX questions. As far as the DIRECTV options, I have a 1-year option on pre-negotiated terms to take EPIX, and the decision will be their's over the next year. We obviously think that EPIX is a highly desirable service with great movies, but it really will be up to them. And as far as the Netflix exclusivity, which is over-the-top exclusivity that is, which is expiring soon, we have -- we're not beginning discussions. We've had discussions with several parties. EPIX is doing very well. Netflix has been a great partner, great partner for EPIX, great partner for Viacom in general. And EPIX certainly drives a value for Netflix. We expect to have an announcement on the outcome of these discussions within the next couple of weeks. So you should expect the announcement from EPIX very shortly on that point. As far as the Nickelodeon Upfront, our advertisers have been very supportive of Nickelodeon. Clearly, in terms of ratings fold in the Upfront, we looked at it based on the new reality that Nickelodeon has. If the ratings will improve, there will be opportunities for us, and it's got a market.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess kind of a follow-up on Rich's question from before that if I look at the contract, I think, you've given in the past about both the BET Awards as well as the Kids' Choice Awards, it looks like it was something like a 350-ish-kind-of-basis-point headwind in the quarter you just reported, where you reported it down 7. And so yes, there is a 150-basis-point headwind from the impact of direct on advertising. But if you're not seeing a material -- an acceleration of kind of a couple of hundred basis points, if my math is right, then the core looks like it's decelerating. And if it's decelerating, is that a function of ratings or market? Could you just give a little bit more color around that? And maybe my math is wrong in the first place, so please correct it, if this needs.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, I'm not quite sure I followed where you were going with that. But in terms of -- about half of the decrement in ad sales in the quarter that was just completed related to the difference in the award shows in the quarter. So that part is correct. As I mentioned earlier, the -- in this quarter that we're in, since the BET Awards were not in the comparable quarter, that's an uplift. That uplift is offset by the advertising loss during the 9 days of the DIRECTV blackout. So we're -- on a comparison with last year, we're back to apples-to-apples, if you will.","Thomas E. Dooley","Clearly, David, the ratings are creating some headwinds in terms of the advertising sales progress. And I mean, it's good -- the good news is that we're starting to see some really good performance. We're rebuilding Nickelodeon half-hour by half-hour. And as we continue to do that, that ratings performance will drive the revenue growth back to where it needs to be.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can I just ask one follow-up as to -- in trying to understand this a little better too. What is the lag that you see between ratings impact and revenue on the way down and, hopefully, on the way up? What kind of lag do you think we see there?","Philippe P. Dauman","Right now, I mean, when you have a significant ratings shortfall, as we experienced in Nickelodeon, that, obviously, eliminates inventory we have available to sell, and you get into mako [ph] situation. That creates an inability to take advantage of the cash market. On the flip side, as that improves, that will just open up inventory for us to monetize. So we'll be able to see a pretty good short-term impact as ratings improve.","Thomas E. Dooley","Many of the networks, David, are positioned so that as soon we get the ratings, we'll be able to draw down on the liability banking and create revenue right away. So we'll come back very quickly when the ratings come back.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet from Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I just had 2 quick questions. The first is, it doesn't -- I remember back in like the '06, '09 time period, we were all very nervous about Paramount and sort of was it going to flip into negative operating income. For a couple years now, and I think based on what you said on the call, you generated sort of $300 million-ish of operating income pretty consistently. Because I think we all struggle with how to model that, I was wondering if you could talk about how much of that is something that is structural, that sort of change the cost structure of Paramount as opposed to just the vagaries of how well or poorly your films do? And my second question is on the ratings. If things go according to plan, what month do you think we can begin to see ratings improve if the investments work out?","Philippe P. Dauman","Jason, as far as Paramount goes, yes, we've made very significant structural changes year after year at Paramount. And as I've said many times in meetings with investors, that's money in the bank. And as you've correctly pointed out, we're, obviously, subject to the vagaries of the film business. But we've been very [indiscernible] and very disciplined on that front as well. We -- as I've talked about before, we've modified the strategy -- the film strategy of Paramount to focus on a more limited number of releases and focusing on franchises and our brands, and that reduces the risk. We very much look at it as a risk-reward situation. And that's why our ROI has been pretty steady at Paramount, and we will endeavor to keep it that way despite the vagaries of the studio business and some of the dynamics that you all know about, such as the decrease in DVD revenue marketplace, somewhat offset by digital revenues coming in. As far as predicting months, what month or what week or whatever rating quarter, we can't -- we don't do that. What we do is we focus on building, on the programs that work, expanding them, adding new programs, and you can never predict the magnitude of a hit when it comes. When it comes, and you take a lot of it best, when it comes, you just ride it. And we, obviously, hope to improve it. We're certainly making an investment. We -- as I mentioned before, we have intensified our focus on programming talent. And our long history in the business shows that, that will -- that, will bear fruit over time. But we're not able to predict days, weeks or particular months, but the magnitude of the new programs coming on gives us reason to believe we're going to see improvement as we head into the new fiscal year.","Thomas E. Dooley","And we've already seen improvement. As we said before, half-hour by half-hour that the ink show block that Philippe referred on Nickelodeon is doing very well and beginning to put us back on track there. And we really have to rebuild it half-hour by half-hour to take market share back from the competitors. And we're doing that, and we're going to continue to do that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, with the DIRECTV deal concluded, can you remind us what percentage of your affiliate revenues are really locked up now for the next few years? And then just a second question on the ad market in the international advertising. I guess, how should think about that going into fiscal Q4? Is the weakness in Europe getting any worse, or it should be about the same sort of trends? And domestically, if you could just touch on how scatter -- what you're seeing in scatter in July?","Philippe P. Dauman","Alexia, let's take your questions in order. As far as affiliate revenues, the way we have conducted our renewables over the last several years, we never have more than 20% of our revenues that are up for renewal in any given year. In a year where we have a huge distributor like DIRECTV, that's kind of the high watermark, where it's close to 20%. We just went through that. It'll be a lower percentage of our revenue in the next couple of years, which was your question. So we have a nice portfolio of affiliate revenue. That's why we're able to so confidently predict the affiliate revenue growth as we go forward. We don't have a situation where we have overwhelming amount of our revenue up in a given year. As far as international advertising trends in the quarter, we expect to see some improvement in our performance in this quarter compared to the quarter we just completed. There were a lot of events that we had in prior year that didn't replicate. And in any kind of these events, very often that we look to do events that are profitable. So it's not all a revenue story. We look to have profitable events. So even though the ad revenue, they go down because of the absence of an event, it doesn't impact the profitability to that same degree because there are costs associated, obviously, with that. And that's why we've been able to grow the margins and the profitability, in addition to the other steps we're taking in the international. As far as the current scatter market, it's pretty healthy, which is, as Tom said, as our rates improve, we can take advantage of it. Scatter pricing scatter-over-scatter right now is up year-on-year, and it's significantly up over upfront. So as Tom said, we'll be able to take advantage as our ratings improve.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I have a question on international margins. I suspect that some of the past several quarters, the international margin expansion did upset some of the advertising revenue shortfall domestically. So Philippe, you mentioned there are some issues developing in Western Europe. Do you think that's threatening the magnitude of margin expansion that you spoke about before and going into 2013?","Philippe P. Dauman","No, we're actually getting very -- I've said before that we were going to have margin in excess of 20% in the 2013 fiscal year. We're actually very close to that now, so we're actually quite confident that our margins will go into the 20%-plus territory in the new year. We've been launching a lot of new channels. So even in a tough environment, as we launch channels, we will get more revenues. We've been focused on efficiencies around the world. And we have new revenue opportunities. The affiliate revenue growth story internationally is also a really good story. So we talk a lot about domestic affiliate revenues, but the international affiliate revenue growth story is a good one. And, yes, there are some markets that are still healthy even within Europe, where we've actually had a -- the U.K. economy has been challenged. Our advertising performance in the U.K., which is a really important market, has been strong. Obviously, in Southern Europe, it's a different story right now. So we will drive our margins forward even in a difficult environment in our international business.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And if I may ask a quick follow-up. How would you explain -- how should we think about the difference in growth rates between what your international networks deliver and, let's say, Discovery or News Corp.? Is it just geographies and that they're exposed to faster growing markets like Brazil and Eastern Europe and Russia and Asia, and you're more --and you're heavier in Western Europe?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, it's a combination of factors. We've emphasized growing some of our more adult brands like COMEDY CENTRAL, like the Paramount Channels. There are dollars available in the adult demo that we haven't been able to tap through our music and kids brands, Nickelodeon and MTV, primarily. So we have an opportunity to get at that adult demo, which will drive it. And then also, you're quite right, we are looking to expand our presence in strong developing markets like Latin America. We have a big presence in India, which is actually below the line, as you know, because it's a joint venture. We're very committed to growing that market and that -- we expect that to create significant value for Viacom as we go forward. And you'll soon hear about some other initiatives that we have in other parts of the world. So yes, the world presents a lot of opportunity for us for the long term. And I believe we will have a very significant value creation in our international networks business over the next several years.","Thomas E. Dooley","And some of those competitors are enjoying the benefit of having started new channels in those markets earlier. And as Philippe mentioned in his remarks, COMEDY CENTRAL is becoming our third global-branded network, and Paramount Channel is right behind it with 5 new channels going in 2013. As those channels get up, get revenue and get rolling, they're going to have a significant margin -- impact, and I think our revenues will enjoy the growth that comes from that.","Philippe P. Dauman","There's a rapid ramp-up on those brands. Obviously, a startup in the first year, but they pretty rapidly turn to profitability.","Thomas E. Dooley","And I think that our competitors are seeing some of that in their P&L results.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Alan Gould from Evercore Partners.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I wanted to get back to the ratings situation again. Philippe, when the ratings became soft 3 quarters ago, you called it a short-term ratings problem. And you opened the call saying they\u2019re cyclical rating softness. You said Nick's poised for an upsurge soon. The July ratings are down. The ratings are down, not only at Nick, but really across SPIKE, MTV, COMEDY and TV Land as well. You're spending the dollars, you're adding new episodes, you say there's been some programming management changes. What gives you the confidence that the ratings will turn? And if these ratings declines don't subside, are you confident that you'll be able to continue repurchasing stock at this rate?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, first of all, the month of July did include the 9-day DIRECTV blackout. That it did impact our ratings. And we've compared the ratings before the blackout and after, and we've come back. So looking at July in isolation is not a good way to look at it. So if you take that impact away, we are, in fact, seeing improvement in some of our core networks. And as I said, it takes a while to create new programming. Shoot it, cast that, do all those things, it doesn't happen in 2 weeks. So we've done a lot of the work. The shows are going to be released over the next several months. And we expect to see a positive impact. And as far as the repurchase program, we are committed to it. We have been able, despite these issues that you point out, to purchase at the pace that we talked about earlier in the year, the $2.8 billion in repurchase. As Tom pointed out, when you add that to the dividend, that's a 14% return on our capitalization. And we continue to generate strong free cash flow. We continue to drive the dynamics, the margins of our business, at Paramount and the Media Networks. We will come back on the -- both the ratings and advertising front. And we will continue to return capital to shareholders over the long term year-after-year. That is our promise to our shareholders.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us on our June quarter earnings call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Viacom continues to deliver great audience experiences, strong reasons [ph] for our shareholders, our leadership and as well position us for many, many years to come, and we are extremely excited about the future.","Now I will turn this call over to my good friend, Viacom's CEO, the wisest man I have ever met, my friend, Philippe Dauman.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you so much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter of our 2014 fiscal year.","Viacom turned in a solid performance in the December quarter. We delivered strong double-digit growth in both our quarterly earnings and operating income. Our Media Networks achieved strong top and bottom line growth, thanks in part to continued ratings strength at many of our networks. Among them Nickelodeon, which regained its long-held perch as a top cable network among kids, 2 to 11. It was a great start to what we expect to be a strong fiscal year in which we will continue to invest consistently in original content and connect with our audiences in a growing number of ways across platforms and geographies.","Let's take a quick look at Viacom's financial performance for the quarter. Tom and Wade will go into greater detail in a few moments. Revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, a decline of 4%, reflecting increased Media Networks revenues, which were more than offset by declines in Filmed Entertainment due to the number and timing of releases in the quarter. Operating income increased to $960 million, up 20%, thanks to improved performance across the company. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 19% to $547 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 32% to $1.20.","Viacom's balance sheet remains strong and the company remains steadfast in its commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders while continuing to invest in the growth of our business. We delivered about $1.1 billion in capital directly to shareholders in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. This includes $850 million in share repurchases under our ongoing stock repurchase program. We expect to repurchase another $850 million in stock in the current quarter, and have increased our expectations for the full fiscal year to at least $3.25 billion.","As I mentioned, our Media Networks delivered strong growth in the quarter, and ratings strength at a number of our key networks fuel that momentum. Nickelodeon reclaimed the top spot among kids' networks for the 2 to 11 audience in the December quarter, thanks to its continued content surge of new original programming across formats and dayparts. Its preschool block was a major highlight with new series \"PAW Patrol\" performing particularly well. Animation generally performed very well, with SpongeBob SquarePants, Sanjay & Craig and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pulling in big audiences. The Ninja Turtles' consumer products line continues to perform very well and is growing fast, ending 2013 as the #1 boys action property in the U.S. toy industry according to NPD.","Through this month, Nickelodeon achieved 12 consecutive months of year-over-year ratings growth. In the current quarter, a special episode of mix live action hits Sam & Cat drew 4.8 million total viewers and was the network's highest rated telecast with kids 6 to 11 since 2012. Episodes of new series, Haunted Hathaways and The Thundermans, also hit new highs. Next month, the network will continue to expand its programming lineup, with the launch of Wallykazam!, a new preschool series focused on children's literacy and Breadwinners, a new series from 2 young animators new to Nick, one of whom is discovered through its Animated Shorts Program. Nickelodeon will bring the quarter to a close with a 2014 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, which will be hosted by the star of Transformers: Age of Extinction, Mark Wahlberg. In short, Nickelodeon is on a roll.","Speaking of being on a roll, COMEDY CENTRAL had a great December quarter, its highest-rated quarter in nearly 6 years among men 18-34 in primetime, thanks to the strength of returning hits, Tosh.0, Key & Peele and South Park. Add to that the continued success of @midnight, the first successful entry into the competitive late-night field in recent history. It's a hit with audiences but also with advertisers who now have additional marketing opportunities in the network's highly coveted late-night block, which, with The Daily Show and Colbert, both the top 3 shows in all of late-night among young men.","In the current quarter, COMEDY CENTRAL returning hits Workaholics and Kroll Show to air along with the debut series Broad City for executive producer Amy Poehler. Poehler recently noted that the network is at a core major point, where it's representing really vital up-and-coming talents. Those talents are fueling a greater offering of top-notch original programming than at any other time in COMEDY CENTRAL's history. SPIKE, VH1 and CMT all delivered strong double-digit year-over-year ratings growth in the December quarter, reflecting our significantly increased investment in originals for all 3 networks. SPIKE, in particular, turning its best December quarter ratings performance since 2010 and its second quarter in a row of double-digit ratings growth. The network continues to successfully broaden its audience, achieving a more desirable gender balance and median age for advertisers. BET also had a great quarter and successfully premiered new series, Being Mary Jane, starring Gabrielle Union this month.","In the current quarter, MTV is returning many hits to air behind an aggressive, targeted marketing campaign. Already, we are seeing results. Teen Wolf, debut its new season this month to a record 2.4 million viewers. Teen Mom 2 also returned last week with 3.2 million viewers, rankings as MTV's highest-rated series premiere in more than a year. It also looked at the premiere of MTV's new dating show, \"Are You The One\", the network's best new franchise launch since Buckwild. Ratings for the revamped Real World continue to grow every week. And MTV is seeing significant strength in its new Thursday night male-focused block, which includes Ridiculousness, Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory and the all-new Jerks With Cameras.","Our Media Networks segment grew domestic advertising by 3% in the December quarter, a result that was tempered somewhat by ratings at MTV in a softer marketplace in the month of November. In the current quarter, while it is still early, we expect to see sequential improvement in our domestic ad sales growth despite the headwind of the shift of Easter to the June quarter this year. We're also encouraged by the improvement in the international ad market, highlighted by growth in certain European territories, which resulted in double-digit growth in international ad sales in the quarter. Additionally, we recently unveiled our reinvented integrated marketing and branded content team, Viacom Velocity, to serve our marketing partners with even greater creative collaboration. This is an area where we've considerably increased our resources over the past several years and the marketplace is taking notice. A recent survey of marketing executives ranked Viacom Media Networks Music and Entertainment the #1 and #2 integrated marketing units in our industry.","On the distribution side, domestic affiliate revenues increased by 10% in the quarter. We continue to expect high-single to low-double digit growth in our affiliate fees for the full year. The highlight of the December quarter was our successful completion of our renewal negotiations with Time Warner Cable, which resulted in one of our most comprehensive multiplatform agreements to date. The deal covers not only our Linear television networks but also streaming channels on the mighty WCTV app, streaming video via our TV Everywhere websites or apps for MTV, Nickelodeon, SPIKE, COMEDY CENTRAL, VH1 and CMT, dynamic ad insertion and more. Very importantly, it also includes distribution of EPIX, beginning in May, marking a major step in the growth and profitability of the premium multiplatform network.","Initiating and supporting product innovation continues to be a key component of our value proposition for cable, satellite and telco distributors. We continue to expand our lineup of TV Everywhere apps with a Nickelodeon and MTV apps rolling out on Android and apps from COMEDY CENTRAL, Nick Jr. and Logo due this year. And in the next few months, we're partnering with Verizon FiOS to bring a new one of its kind linear service to U.S. consumers, My Nick Jr. Results initially by Nickelodeon Friends, My Nick Jr. is a standalone linear channel that gives parents and their young kids unprecedented personalization functionality. Parents can customize the programming lineup based on certain educational themes, math or science, for example. Kids can also indicate whether they like or dislike a show to influence their program offering. It's a truly innovative new service and we hope to roll out with additional distributors, both domestic and international, in the future.","Internationally, we're seeing improving conditions in the European economy, as I mentioned earlier, which is lifting the ad market. We continue to increase our content investment abroad to capture the opportunities we see at hand. This includes our recent moves to take operational ownership of MTV Italy and to launch wholly-owned MTV channels in Russia and Brazil. We're already seeing the benefit of these moves, as well as our launch of the Paramount Channel in France and I am pleased to announce today that the Paramount Channel will launch in Russia and Hungary by the end of the current quarter.","Moving on to our Filmed Entertainment segment, Paramount Pictures launched a number of successful releases in the December quarter including Anchorman 2, Wolf of Wall Street and yes, ladies and gentlemen, the Oscar-nominated Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa. In fact, the studio garnered 13 Oscar nominations in total, not only for Bad Grandpa, but also for Wolf of Wall Street and Nebraska, both of which, we are proud to say, earned nods in the Best Picture, Best Actor and Directing categories.","Looking ahead into 2014, we have Darren Aronofsky's Noah, starring Russell Crowe, debuting in March. We also have strong tentpoles lined up for the summer season including Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as well as Hercules, starring Dwayne Johnson.","Also, expect to see more announcements in the months to come from Paramount's new television production units. For starters, the TV studio has just completed a multiproject deal with director and screenwriter Craig Brewer of Hustle & Flow and Footloose. This deal includes humming 2 dramatic pilots for the studio.","To close, the December quarter marked a very solid start to the 2014 fiscal year for Viacom. As we move ahead, we will maintain our strategic focus on content, investing in the programming and films that drive the new entertainment ecosystem. We will leverage that content to connect marketing partners with our audiences, who remain among the most eager consumers of media and the earliest adopters of new technologies and features. We will continue to fuel the platforms of existing and emerging distributors alike on a worldwide basis. And we will continue to drive results and return substantial capital and value to our shareholders.","Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.","Wade C. Davis","Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results.","At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 6% compared with the prior year, with domestic revenues up 5% and international revenues up 10%. The increase in revenues in the quarter was principally driven by increases in affiliate and advertising revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides the breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.","Domestic advertising revenues were up 3% in the quarter and international advertising revenues were up 16%. The growth in the international advertising reflects an improving marketplace in Europe, as well as the impact of new channels. In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 10% in the quarter while international revenues were up 8%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. Growth in the international revenues was due to rate and subscriber increases, as well as new channel launches.","Expenses increased 5% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 2% while distribution and other costs increased 19%, principally due to new channels in the international markets.","SG&A expenses increased 5%, reflecting higher compensation as well as the impact of new channels in the international markets.","Media Networks adjusted operating income was up 8% and the adjusted operating income margin was 44%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin increase was driven by top line growth of 6%, partially offset by 5% growth in expenses.","Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were down 30% in the quarter, principally due to declines in theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.","Theatrical revenues decreased 52%, principally reflecting fewer releases in the quarter, as well as lower carryover revenues. We released 5 titles this year compared to 8 titles in the prior December quarter. Home entertainment revenues declined 37%, driven primarily by the absence of the current quarter release. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $74 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $139 million last year. The improvement principally reflects lower print and advertising costs related to the number and mix of theatrical titles released in the quarter.","Now moving below the line, the increase in the interest expense reflects the full quarter impact of the $3 billion of fixed rate that we issued back in August. In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.5%, reflecting a 100 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily driven by the mix of international income.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover the seasonal factors impacting our 2014 fiscal year.","For the quarter, we generated $278 million in free cash flow compared to $548 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to higher working capital utilization and cash taxes, partially offset by higher operating income. Working capital was impacted by production spending for our upcoming tentpole releases, including Transformers 4, Interstellar, and SpongeBob.","Now turning to our debt. For the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 20 to 25 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.","As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $11.9 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.73x. At December 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our return of capital to shareholders continued in the December quarter. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $1.1 billion of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 440 million shares outstanding.","Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $850 million of our stock in the March quarter, which means that for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $2 billion to shareholders.","Now let's turn to some other factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, we continue to see annual growth in the high-single digit to low-double digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the mid-to high-single digits. In terms of nonprogramming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.","At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about the upcoming summer tentpole releases, including Transformers: Age of Extinction and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. We expect profits at the studio to be weighted to the back half of the fiscal year. Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, we've recently wrapped production on Interstellar, which is directed by Chris Nolan and stars Matthew McConaughey. We are also currently in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises including Mission: Impossible, Star Trek, G.I. Joe and World War Z. In terms of our animation label, Paramount has a number of products -- projects in the pipeline with SpongeBob and Monster Trucks, scheduled for release in 2015.","For 2014, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 33.5%, reflecting the mix of international profits. We will continue to refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the profitability mix.","Wrapping up, we delivered strong bottom line results and we saw a positive developments on several fronts during the quarter. With the European marketplace showing signs of improvement, we saw our international advertising accelerates, and improving macro environment, coupled with our investment in original programming and new channels, should position us well for long-term growth in our international operations. In terms of affiliate fees, we continue to reach long-term agreements with our distribution partners that position us for growth, as well as for consumption of our content on digital platforms. We secured additional carriage for our EPIX pay TV service, and we are encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands with new distribution partners.","Paramount continues to develop tentpole franchises, and we are excited about the upcoming slate and development pipeline, as well as the studios plans to develop new revenue streams. And we continue to find the opportunities to drive efficiencies throughout our businesses in order to enhance our margins and drive earnings per share and free cash flow. These efforts, combined with our aggressive return of capital, will continue to drive value for our shareholders.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have a question for Philippe. You guys are the first pure-play cable networks to report and you talked about some weakness in the quarter around November in advertising pacings. Could you provide a little more information of what happened, did you think, in the fourth quarter? I know you ended the third quarter really strong, so when you looked at what happened in the fourth quarter, what was -- what do you think the drag was from? And then when we look at the first quarter, I think Easter is about 150 basis points impact on a quarterly comps, if you can just give us, is that the right type of drag you have and you're going to grow even despite that comps? I just wanted to hear what you said about the quarter and why do you think that was?","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you, Michael. As far as November, remember, we were coming out of the continued budget discussions in Washington as we were coming out of October. And that just created a lot of uncertainty in the business community. You had companies who were feeling uncertain, trying to make their years and retrenching a bit. That dissipated once the budget deal occurred and we started seeing strength again in December and certainly continuing into this quarter, where demand is back to normal. As far as the move of Easter from this quarter to the next, yes, it has probably a little over 150 basis points of drag -- of headwinds in this quarter. Of course, it'll be a tailwind in the next quarter. But despite that, we will see absolute growth, sequential improvement in ad sales growth from December quarter, and we see good strength in demand in the marketplace right now. And of course, we're off to a great start on our ratings.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just I guess a couple of questions, Philippe. Netflix announced it would've significant European launches later this year. Is that a meaningful incremental revenue opportunity for Viacom? Or is that sort of already expected? And I'm curious if you think that 2014 will be the year that a virtual MVPD gets launched? Sony's talked about launching something and how that would impact Viacom's businesses?","Philippe P. Dauman","Welcome, Doug. While whether it's Netflix or Amazon, or local players, over-the-top players in different countries around the world, there is clearly an expansion of this new distribution marketplace. It's an opportunity for us to monetize our global library. It was U.S.-based product or more and more original content that we are producing abroad. And that can only be good for a company like ours, who produces a lot of content. So yes, it will over time continue to be an incremental opportunity for us. As far -- I do think, obviously, I don't control what companies do, but based on a variety of discussions that we're having, I do believe that there'll be at least one virtual MVPD player commencing operations in 2014. And once again, that is a good opportunity for us to enter into a new relationships with emerging distributors to add to our stable of the existing ones. So all of these are good incremental opportunities over time. Obviously, they're small when they launch, but they can build over time.","Operator","We'll go next to David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You spent some time talking about some of the international initiatives, launch of Paramount, consolidating Italy, launching Russia, Brazil. Can you give us a sense of the lift you think you could get to revenues from all those things on both on ad side and then affiliate side? And what the impact -- is it a lift? Is it a headwind in the initial years on the operating income side?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, clearly it's a lift on the revenue side. We are taking every opportunity as we have renewals or even before renewals of affiliate deals to add distribution, not just for the Paramount Channel and the launches that we talked about for MTV in Russia and Brazil and so forth, but additional Nickelodeon channels where we can leverage a content library around the world that really works very well. So again, I talked about it in the past, but where we have Nickelodeon, we've been adding Nick Jr. and Nicktoons, and looking at other opportunities to leverage all this great content we are producing. And clearly, when you do channel launches, there are some expenses, startup expenses associated with those launches. But it's really setting ourselves up for really fast growth over a period of years. We are focused on building significant asset value over time around the world, and it's very exciting where we're doing very, very well in growing our footprint.","Operator","We'll go next to Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just going back to your commentary about acceleration in domestic ad growth in the March quarter, how much of that do you think is coming from the strength you mentioned about the stronger demand and the marketplace, sort of helped your marketplace overall versus maybe some potential improvements in ratings at MTV given your strong start to a couple of new shows?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, clearly, the strength of our ratings is important and MTV is off to a good start in the quarter and several of our other networks, including COMEDY CENTRAL and SPIKE and CMT. Really across-the-board, we are seeing some good strength. We also provide the best opportunities in the business to our advertising clients and integrated marketing. We made an announcement about Viacom Velocity. But that's not the beginning. That's just the continuation of the increased investment that we have made in integrated marketing, creating content for our marketing partners. And that's also driving growth in ad revenues and deepening our relationships with our marketing partners. And we keep adding new shows, new events. So later in the year, we're going to have a big new Nickelodeon event, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards Sports Edition in the summer. And those events allow us, again, to have additional conversations with existing and new advertising partners.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just saying -- and just a follow up on MTV, do you have any sense on how much of the viewership in MTV is sort of a delayed viewing and how much you could potentially see a lift, therefore, from the final rollout of the cross-platform system by Nielsen by the end of the year?","Philippe P. Dauman","You raised a very good issue because increasingly, there should be less focus on the live same day ratings. A lot of shows see a lot of lift in the C3 period, and so the C3 ratings, which, of course, are the ones we monetize, particularly for a lot of our original shows, really see a nice lift. We are very encouraged by Nielsen working to get to a more effective multiplatform measurements, and we are working with them as a test of the new services that they are providing to programmers, and that will provide additional monetization opportunities for us, particularly as we are rolling out our TV Everywhere functionality with distributors. And accordingly, we'll have more monetization opportunities on different platforms.","Operator","We'll go next to Bryan Wieser of Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Actually, I did have a question on velocity. More specifically, I was wondering, is there any way you could dimensionalize what percentage of your ad revenues or campaigns or anything like that, that you sell in a, let's call it, an enhanced manner? In other words, it's more than just about the tonnage, it's about something like what Velocity is trying to do. And secondly, I was wondering on the European advertising, I was wondering if there are any particular countries of particular strength of performance versus your average in particular countries that are underperforming than average?","Philippe P. Dauman","So, Bryan, your first question, there's really no way to dimensionalize. It's really a part, it's a special sauce that we provide to our advertising and marketing partners. And it gets us in the door, it enhances it. But it's becoming a normal part, increasing part of our value proposition with the marketers. As far as European advertising, we're seeing really solid strengths also driven by ratings, by the way, in the U.K., throughout Northern Europe. We're seeing stabilization in Southern Europe with some signs of emerging growth there. So it's expansioning the decline in the countries that were having difficulties over the last few years and greater velocity in countries that were relatively stable during that period.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Maybe relatedly, do you think the Olympics in Sochi makes any impact on some of the European markets in the quarter?","Philippe P. Dauman","To some degree, but it's temporary. Certainly, it was planned for and it's a little bit of a drag during that period in the quarter, but underlying that, we have good momentum.","Operator","We'll go next to Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the lumpiness of affiliate fees that's tied to Internet deals. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of timing that could affect the next couple of quarters? Is there anything that you can talk to at this point?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, again, it's really hard to use a word that Bryan used, to dimensionalize that because a lot of this is tied to product availability and some of the distributors involved request availability at certain time periods. But that does add a level of lumpiness that you don't see in the traditional affiliate agreements, which are the baseline. And that's why we stick to the full-year guidance, which we've been comfortable giving year after year of high-single digits to low-double digits affiliate growth. And we continue to see that guidance as being the underpinning of our affiliate revenue stream.","Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, all right. Let me switch gears a little bit then. On the TV production focus, could you talk a little bit about where you see the real opportunity? I mean historically, the money has been in broadcast level shows, but I think the new opportunity is for more shows on Internet platforms and on cable networks. Where is your focus going to be on the TV side and how much of an opportunity do you see there?","Philippe P. Dauman","Our TV production group at Paramount is, it's first creatively driven. They've had an amazing amount of interest from the creative community. Some were involved with the studio on the film side, some of them were more traditional television writers and directors and producers. So there are discussions going on with the over-the-top players, with pay services, really both in the U.S. and international players because we do want to marry both when it comes to dramatic series, for example. And for cable networks, including, for certain projects, our own, as we continue to increase our ambitions and scripted original programming. And then of course, to the extent that there are some broadcast opportunities, we'll look for those. So you'll see there are a number of projects that are close to green lighting and the Paramount will be making some announcements over the months to come.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Greenfield of BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","EPIX is an interesting topic. I think even we were pretty critical of the original decision or skeptical of the original decision. Your distribution has gotten pretty wide and I'm -- it seems like you've got a couple of major issues to deal with over the next couple of years and I'm curious how do you think about them. One, with the Time Warner deal, I assume you're going to move now into original programming. Curious how much the partners are willing to commit and kind of how you're going to approach building out original programming to really differentiate it from just being a movie distribution service? And then two, I think your deal with Netflix is up in summer of 2015. They've talked about the lack of interest or less interest in noninclusive programming, yet they seem to be marketing a lot of the EPIX product now on the movie side pretty aggressively. I'm just wondering how you think about the importance of continuing that Netflix relationship or whether there is other ways to continue to drive the value out of EPIX through your MVPD partners?","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you, Richard, and thank you for your comments about EPIX. Yes, EPIX has been a very successful new venture for us and our partners, Lionsgate and MGM. It was profitable within a year of launch, and it has continued to grow since then. And we've been patiently expanding the distribution that will continue. It's working well for the distribution and, of course, that's proof of concept and helps us to build distribution over time. Movies are the underpinning, and EPIX has a particularly strong lineup of movies when you consider the great franchises that all 3 partners have, whether it's all these franchises we talked about in our earnings remarks for Paramount and when you think about a Hunger Games from Lionsgate or the Bond Pictures from MGM. It's perhaps the best lineup of any pay service in the marketplace. As we have increased, certainly with Time Warner Cable being a big step in the so-called traditional distribution, the time is near to -- for us to expand our original programming lineup. We already have original programming on EPIX, but we are talking, the partners are talking about getting into scripted series programming at EPIX, and you'll see that coming to help cement and further grow the economics of EPIX. As far as distribution arrangements, whether it's Netflix or Amazon or others that we have, we think it's a desirable service for everyone, and we of course will engage in private discussions and negotiations with all of our distributors about the future. But I'm quite confident that EPIX will see even better times ahead.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And could you just update us on who you're missing major distributor-wise as you start 2014? Who are the big ones?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, the big ones, yes, yet to launch would include Comcast and DIRECTV.","Operator","We'll go next to Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the Olympics and on your domestic networks. Is there any impact that we might see either on how you program during that time period, or any expected impact on ratings or revenue during that time period? That's the first question. And then secondly, Wade, I think you said international advertising was the -- growth was partly organic and partly from new channels. Can you give us a breakout of what was the contribution from organic growth versus the new channel?","Philippe P. Dauman","That question, Wade, the last one?","Wade C. Davis","The impact in the quarter from new channel launches was actually relatively small, just because the channel launches occurred towards the end of the quarter. So in terms of breaking out a specific amount, I'm not sure that we're prepared to do that, but I think, suffice to say, it was relatively de minimis.","Philippe P. Dauman","As far as the Olympics, it's predictable. The Winter Olympics don't have as much of an impact as the Summer Olympics. The location means, the time -- big time difference, which will impact the Olympics effect on us. And so our networks -- we'll program accordingly, highly predictable and as we discussed earlier as far as the ad revenues, we continue to see sequential improvement overall in the quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Vasily Karasyov of Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a 2 quick ones. You seem to be very happy with your deal with Time Warner Cable. I was wondering if the potential sale of Time Warner Cable, in whole or in part, is a threat to the terms that you got there? And then the second question is on international networks. Can it be that the improving economics of international networks can help you move your sort of historical margin expansion target above 35 basis points or so a year?","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you for your questions. As far as the Time Warner Cable deal, obviously, we concluded the extension in the midst of the focus on M&A related to the company. We don't think that a deal would have a significant impact on us, and we look forward to seeing what happens as a result of what's going on now. As far as the international networks, we are continuing to drive efficiency there as we do domestically, but we're also going to be opportunistic about increasing our footprint, and clearly, we're not going to -- so we're driving revenue. We're driving margins on our existing networks internationally, but we will take every opportunity that we see to launch new networks and when we launch a network that has an opposite effect on our margins. But that's really excellent for the long-term health of that group. So, yes, that makes it a little hard to predict the velocity of margin improvement, but over the long term as we do this, clearly, we will emerge with a margin improvement as we build this business.","Operator","We'll go next to Vijay Jayant of ISI Group.","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is David Joyce for Vijay. 2 topics. On your new network launches internationally, I was wondering what the revenue mix is between affiliate and ad revenue right now and where do you see that going with these new launches? And then secondarily, you had mentioned dynamic ad insertion as part of your Time Warner Cable deal. Can you talk about when you think that will be impacting the industry in terms of Nielsen, looking at, I think, at the VOD viewership and the relative impressions in ad revenue that could come from that?","Philippe P. Dauman","Welcome, David. As far as new launches, every the marketplace is different, so we look for the revenue maximizing mix depending on the market. So for example, on making decisions on whether we go to pay television distribution or free over the air, yes, we look at the bottom line. Free over the air, obviously, there's no affiliate and higher advertising. But if the -- in a particular country, the affiliate opportunity is stronger, we will sacrifice ad revenues in order to get the affiliate revenue. What we're looking is to maximize results. So it's really a country by country analysis as to what the overall mix. When you blend it all together in a good economic environment, on average, we should grow both at decent rates. And as far as dynamic ad insertion, firstly, the distributors themselves have to have the technological capability. I think with companies like Time Warner Cable, obviously, I let them make their own announcements, but they're very close to implementing that as are other distributors. And then secondly, as we discussed earlier in this call, we are encouraged by Nielsen's imminent progress on measuring multiplatform viewership, and accordingly the ads that appear on these platforms.","Operator","We'll go next to Tony Wible of Janney Capital Markets.","Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","The Time Warner deal, are there certain level of marketing commitments associated with the EPIX carriage? And then also, I was hoping you could just recap on mobile advertising and just the rapid shift to it? I know you guys have the mobile apps, but are there other opportunities to monetize that trend?","Philippe P. Dauman","I'll take the Time Warner Cable question. I'll let Tom answer the mobile advertising one. As far as our agreement with Time Warner Cable, yes, we work together very collaboratively. I think both Time Warner Cable and ourselves are excited about the launch of EPIX, and we are determined to see it succeed as are they. So we will support the marketing, the rollout. We have very strong marketing capabilities that have fueled the success of EPIX with existing distributors, and we'll make that work very positively for Time Warner Cable.","Thomas E. Dooley","Mobile's a -- huge folks for the company. Our content is doing very, very well in terms of consumption across all mobile devices. Our apps are being churned out very, very quickly across both the iPhone world and the iDevice world and the Android world and as far as an advertising environment, it is very, very valuable inventory that the more we have, the more revenue we can generate for it. So we see great growth potential as our product becomes more widely available across more mobile apps and more mobile devices. So that's a very exciting growth area for the company in the next few years ahead.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, on advertising environment, Facebook and Google, obviously, continue to grow pretty significantly, and they have a different product than your channels, of course, but they seem to be focused on some of your core demographics. So I'm curious as to whether you're seeing their growth impacting the competitive marketplace as it applies to your advertising growth potential. And then secondly, on the cost side, with respect to the rating strength that you've seen, is this -- is the success of your programming having a positive impact on your expectations for program spending over the course of the year? Is that -- did that help benefit margins in the first quarter and is that what gives you some confidence in the higher pace of share repurchases this year in terms of capital being freed up?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, on your first question, we work very collaboratively with companies like Facebook, like Twitter on -- in many ways, so from marketing standpoint, programmatic standpoint and we are using them to help drive our ratings and accordingly our monetization and increase the engagement of our viewers who are using multiple platforms in their media lives. So we don't see that impacting our ability to grow. It's up to us to produce a great compelling content, provide great marketing opportunities to reach these audiences who are very attached to our brands. And on the cost side, we have been, over a period of years, we have done 2 things: one, we have increased our investment in programming, but two, we have also gradually shifted the mix at several of our networks from -- in some cases entirely acquired programming to more of a mix of original programming, and that has certainly helped. We'll continue to invest. We are going to grow on a full-year basis our programming expansion in the mid- to high-single digit range. But overall on the cost side, we will continue to manage our cost base prudently, as Tom said earlier, to preserve and enhance our margins.","Thomas E. Dooley","And we'll continue to use the excess free cash flow we have on share repurchases. And as everyone knows, our ability to generate excess free cash flow is significant and that's what drives our share repurchase appetite.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And how is that programming expense growth expectation? Is it impacted by the success of the ratings as the year progresses or is it pretty set whether the show's work or not?","Thomas E. Dooley","We're always investing in new shows for the new hits that are going to impact the next years and the years beyond, and that really drives the incremental growth and you can never be -- you can never sit on your hands and assume the hits you have today are the hits that are going to carry you into the future.","Philippe P. Dauman","The other thing I would like to point out as far as the programming spending is that there are now incremental revenue opportunities on the affiliate side. So investing in programming is just not driving the ratings, it's also an opportunity into the future as you have new launches around the world to monetize what gets added to the library in a way we are unable to do in past years, where there really wasn't for us an incremental monetization opportunity. So we get it -- we get back some of that increased spending on programming through licensing and other revenue opportunities.","Operator","We'll go next to Tuna Amobi of S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Tom, is there any reason that we shouldn't expect the same kind of improvement in the ETR that you saw this year, especially with your international ramp up is still ongoing?","Thomas E. Dooley","In programming what, Tuna?","Wade C. Davis","Effective tax rate.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","The effective tax rate.","Thomas E. Dooley","Well, yes. I think it really depends a lot on how certain movies, one, large movie in particular that we expect to do very well internationally, that would be Transformers 4. The extent to which that has foreign -- overseas profits, revenues and profit, that could impact the tax rate and bring it down a little if it does better than we currently have in the budget.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to the Viacom Fiscal First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Teleconference. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter ended December 31. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page #2 in the Web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sumner.","Sumner M. Redstone","Thank you, Jim. Good morning to all. I am pleased to once again also join Philippe, Tom, Jimmy to discuss Viacom's quarterly results. Despite a choppy overall economy, it was in fact another successful period on both the top and bottom line for Viacom as we continue to use our creative resources, our financial discipline to deliver for shareholders. Our Media Networks are highly in demand all over the world. The creative minds behind our brands are constantly evolving our private property to ensure genuine connections in our industry [ph], new opportunities for our business partners. Paramount Pictures continued to prove they have an unparalleled ability to market and distribute a great slate of motion pictures and ended the calendar year ranked #1 of all the United States box office, the #1 studio. We are indeed in a strong position [indiscernible]. Then, of course, is this possible with our outstanding leadership. Our experienced management team skillfully execute our plans to provide valuable creative content to audiences across the globe for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Now I'd like to turn this call over to the leader of that team, a man who I appropriately call the wisest man I have ever met, my friend and colleague, Philippe Dauman.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you very much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today. Despite headwinds in ad sales, Viacom ended the first quarter of our fiscal year with significant strength. Across the company, we have real momentum. Creative and operational excellence are showing through in every corner of our business and at this early stage, we are seeing ad sales improvement in the second quarter. We're continuing to invest in more and more original programming to strengthen our brands and their deep audience connections. It was true in 2011 and it will be true again in 2012. In fact, in our 2012 fiscal year, Viacom will invest about $3 billion in our Media Networks programming. As a result, our Media Networks attract the most desirable audiences, making Viacom a first-choice partner for marketers and distributors alike. This investment and those relationships will drive our success quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year.","We continue to see strong affiliate growth as both existing and emerging distributors turn to our brand to fuel their products and services. We expect our affiliate revenue to grow on an annualized basis in the high-single to low-double digit for the foreseeable future. As we unlock value for our content across platform, we're unlocking growth potential across global markets as well, expanding our footprint and margins internationally with our Media Networks and Paramount's rich film library. Creative success and operational discipline are hand in glove at Paramount Pictures, and the studio remains focused on its strategy of releasing a streamlined slate of franchise tentpoles and reasonably priced films with box office potential, supported by one of the industry's finest distribution and marketing organizations.  And that strategy is clearly working as evidenced by Paramount's outstanding performance as the #1 studio at the worldwide box office in 2011.","Finally, by operating efficiently, managing costs and seizing every opportunity to monetize our content, we continue to generate significant free cash flow and to make good on our commitment to return substantial capital to our shareholder both in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.","This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the first quarter and share highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions. Let's begin with the numbers.","Viacom's consolidated revenues grew 3% to $3.95 billion in the first quarter, driven by growth in both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Media Networks delivered 3% growth in revenues and a 7% increase in operating income on strong increases in affiliate revenues. Filmed Entertainment grew revenues by 4%, driven by higher theatrical revenues, but solid bottom line decline due largely to the comparison with the sale of Marvel Studios' distribution rights in the first fiscal quarter of 2011. Our net earnings from continuing operations decreased 5% to $591 million in the December quarter and diluted earnings per share increased to $1.06, up 4% over the first quarter of fiscal 2011. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased $700 million in stock and in the current quarter, we are on track to buy back another $700 million.","Let's turn now to our Media Networks. Our portfolio of cable networks is the strongest in the industry, accounting for a far greater share of all basic cable viewing in the U.S. than any other programming group. We built equity with our audiences by knowing and understanding them better than anyone. We have a proven ability to translate consumer insights into compelling original programming, innovative multi-platform content and valuable connections through social media. We will continue to invest judiciously in original programming, research and marketing to keep our Media Networks thriving regardless of changes in the media landscape and economic environment.","As I indicated in December, we did see softness in the overall ad market during our fiscal first quarter. For the quarter, our advertising revenues decreased 3% domestically and 4% internationally. Domestic declines were driven by significant softness in volume in the scatter market, especially after Thanksgiving and previously discussed rating softness. We are seeing signs of recovery in the current quarter scatter with a number of buyers returning to the market. As they do, we are confident that our brands will capture their share of dollars.","Shifting gears to distribution. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased by 16%, driven by significant rate increases and the benefits of digital distribution. During the quarter, we successfully closed a number of affiliate deals and expanded existing agreements, including growing our HD footprint with several cable and telco providers. We also locked up additional distribution deals, including our launch with the debut of Netflix in the U.K. And next week, a new online partner will announce a deal we just signed that involves a wide selection of our library content. Partnerships like these are high-margin opportunities to monetize our content library. We see a significant opportunity for continued growth here.","We are also stressing our relationships with traditional distributors by fueling the expansion of their products and services, including increased offerings across VOD, authenticated websites and apps and ITV. As we continue to innovate and expand our partnerships with our existing distributors, we are constantly evaluating new distribution opportunities for our content, both long and short form.","International growth is a key priority for Viacom. Over the last several years, we have made it a strategic priority to streamline and strengthen our international organization, pursue strategic initiatives and partnerships and launch more channels and more original programming to drive ratings and revenue. We're seeing real progress. As we said on the last call, we are well on our way to achieving our goal of 20-percent plus margins internationally in our next fiscal year.","The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was a very strong quarter for Viacom International Media Networks, driven by affiliate growth and expanded efficiencies. We see our affiliate growth continuing and ad sales growth returning as we move forward.","Our priority channels for global expansion showed strong ratings growth. Internationally, ratings at Nickelodeon and Comedy were up substantially. The EMAs, MTV's signature international tentpole, saw ratings up 37% across global markets. We successfully launched new comedy channels in Holland, India and Africa and yesterday, in Latin America. We'll be announcing more comedy launches soon.","We have also begun a number of consumer products initiatives. Consumer products is another area with significant upside over the next several years. Our pipeline is rich with character-driven content in Nickelodeon and our new Paramount Animation label that will help drive consumer products growth in the long-term.","Moving to ratings highlights at our domestic Media Networks. The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was MTV's highest-rated December quarter in 4 years and the network's eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth overall. MTV continues to assert itself as the cultural home of the millennial generation with a smart mix of original reality and scripted programming. Jersey Shore was the #1 show in MTV's target 12-34 demo every week it aired and returned this quarter with a premiere episode that attracted 7.6 million viewers. Teen Mom 2 was the #3 original cable series in the 12-34 demo for the quarter and new shows, Ridiculousness, Beavis and Butthead and breakout scripted-hit, Awkward, all placed among the top 25.","MTV also built on a social media dominance, finishing the first quarter as the #1 media network on Facebook, the #1 brand on Foursquare and Tumblr and the most social cable network of 2011 according to SocialGuide. In the current quarter, MTV will see the premieres of a new scripted series, I Just Want My Pants Back, which debuts tonight; the launch of a Jersey Shore spinoff with Pauly D; the return of pop-culture phenomenon, Punk'd and a new season of 16 & Pregnant.","Comedy Central continues to draw its core male audience with great original programming anchored by its dominant late-night block, which is stronger than ever with election 2012 gaining steam. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart turned in a historic performance in the 2011 calendar year, surpassing NBC's The Tonight Show as the #1 late-night show with viewers 18-49 for the first time ever.","For the quarter, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report were the highest-rated and most-watched late-night shows on all of television with male and total viewers aged 18-34. Newcomer, Workaholics, continued to build its fan base, finishing the calendar year as the #1 new comedy on all television with men 18-24. And finally, we renewed South Park through 2016, ensuring a milestone 20 seasons in a landmark animated series.","Comedy Central has great momentum in the current quarter as well. Just this week, we saw the strong season premiere of Tosh.0, which drew 3.1 million viewers as well as the series premiere of new sketch comedy show, Key & Peele, which drew 2.1 million total viewers, making it the biggest series launch on Comedy in more than 2 years.","Despite the measurement issues we mentioned on last quarter's call, Nickelodeon finished the fiscal quarter as the #1 cable network with both kids and total viewers for the 67th consecutive quarter, highlighted by the launch of Kung Fu Panda and the second installment in the Fred TV movie franchise, which averaged 7 million total viewers. On Nick at Nite, our third annual HALO Awards, honoring teens for their commitment to service, delivered the tentpoles' highest ratings ever with teens and tweens.","This fiscal year, Nickelodeon will premiere more than 500 episodes of original programming, more than ever before, and we will keep layering on new shows to rebuild our rating.  The current quarter has been full of live-action premieres, including iCarly, which has attracted more than 4 million viewers in each of its 3 episodes this quarter and grown ratings in key kids 6-11 demo with each episode. House of Anubis ratings are also climbing steadily with ratings improving 10% in the week following its January premiere. Last Saturday, the premier of Victorious was the #1 program on cable, attracting 3.9 million viewers.","This Saturday, we premiere How to Rock, staring Cymphonique Miller and in March, we'll debut a new TV movie from Big Time Rush, who along with Fresh Beat Band, were 1 of 2 Nickelodeon kids music act to sell out a nationwide concert tour last quarter. Additionally, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. will have new episodes of their gold standard preschool educational programming such as Dora the Explorer and the Bubble Guppies and will launch new series, Mike the Knight and a new CG version of Franklin and friends. Nickelodeon will conclude the quarter with the Kid's Choice Award, hosted this year by Will Smith on March 31.","BET continued to roll as the network built on its lineup of original scripted series with Reed Between the Lines, which ranked in the top 5 among new scripted series on basic cable. The BET Hip Hop Awards 2011 premier in October drew in 4.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched edition of the franchise tentpole in its 60-year history. The current quarter saw the return of Let's Stay Together, which attracted 3.5 million total viewers with its season premiere and smash hit, THE GAME, which debuted its fifth season last month with a premier that attracted 5.3 million viewers, thanks in part to a dynamic social media marketing strategy.","VH1's ratings momentum picked up steam in the first quarter with ratings in primetime up 42% year-over-year and 72% in the key women 18-34 demographic. The current quarter saw the return of hit series, Mob Wives, which attracted 2.4 million total viewers in its premiere broadcast. The 2011 VH1 DIVAS Celebrates Soul broadcast, featuring Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson, scored the franchise's highest rating since it returned in 2009, doubling ratings over last year's show.","Spike continued to broaden its appeal with men of all ages through original hits, including Auction Hunters and Flip Men. The original comedy, Blue Mountain State, delivered its highest-rated season to date, up 20% in the key men 18-34 demo. This quarter, Spike very successfully launched INK MASTER, the Dave Navarro-hosted tattoo competition, which is building into a bona fide major hit.","TV Land continued to cement its standing as the home of the sitcom on cable with the return of Hot In Cleveland and the premiere of The Exes. In fact, Hot In Cleveland just won the People's Choice Award for favorite cable TV sitcom and star, Betty White, won the Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series. TV Land also picked up a Hot In Cleveland spinoff starring Cedric \"The Entertainer\" and Niecy Nash.","CMT continues to grow its offering of original programming, delivering 4 original series in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, including Sweet Home Alabama. In the current quarter, CMT launched 3 new series, including Bayou Billionaires and My Big Red Neck Vacation, which debuted as the highest-rated original series telecast in CMT history.","Let's turn now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount, which proudly celebrates its 100th year in 2012 as the oldest studio in Hollywood, ended the calendar year with a record $5.17 billion at the worldwide box office, including its first $1 billion franchise, Transformers. The first fiscal quarter of 2012 was highlighted by the blockbuster performance of Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, which reinvigorated the Tom Cruise-starring franchise under the guidance of director, Brad Bird and producer, J.J. Abrams and is now the-highest grossing Mission: Possible; the successful release of Paranormal Activity 3, which continued the phenomenal profitability of that franchise and the outstanding distribution of Hugo and DreamWorks Animation's Puss In Boots. In the current quarter, we released The Devil Inside, another highly profitable title for us with franchise potential from our Insurge label.","Our original and distributed films also scored a number of Acadamy Award nominations led by Hugo, which scored 11 nominations, including Best Picture and a directing nod for Martin Scorsese. Our very own Rango, as well as both DreamWorks Animation films were nominated for Best Animated Feature Film.","Looking ahead, Paramount with Fox will rerelease TITANIC digitally remastered in 3D, thanks to a painstaking conversion helmed by director Jim Cameron. Paramount will also release The Dictator, starring Sacha Baron Cohen and directed by Larry Charles, the team behind Borat; and G.I. Joe: Retaliation, the next film in the global franchise starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Channing Tatum. And the studio will build value by supporting our international division's launch of Paramount television channel, the first of which will debut in Spain in the coming months.","In sum, despite some early headwinds, Viacom is off to a strong start in fiscal 2012. As we move forward, our consistent focus on content and brand building will drive creative momentum across the company in the full freight of original programming launching across our network and in the focus and franchise-centric releases from our studio. We will seek out and seize every opportunity on every platform to monetize our content both in the United States and internationally. And our disciplined operation and management for top and bottom line growth will give us the continued flexibility to invest in content and return substantial capital to our shareholders for many years to come.","With that, I will turn it over to Jimmy.","James W. Barge","Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and Web presentation, summarizing the results of our December quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. Before I do that, I'd like to note that discontinued operations in the December quarter of this year reflects the $383 million charge related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix. In this regard, I would note that we have filed a lawsuit seeking to compel consideration of arguments and evidence that we believe were inappropriately excluded from the dispute resolution process.","Now, let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues increased 3% to $2.4 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 3% and international revenues increased 2% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.","Page 9 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues declined 3% in the quarter. International advertising declined 4% with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 1 percentage point. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to the timing of event-driven programming.","In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 16% while international revenues increased 18%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreement as well as by rate increases from traditional distributors. Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high-single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate and subscriber increases and new channel launches.","Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 13% in the quarter, principally due to lower home entertainment revenue. Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion in the quarter increased 7% over last year. The operating margin of 46% improved 190 basis points over the prior year.","The improvement in the margin was driven by revenue growth of 3% and a 1% decline in expenses. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a 2% decline in programming expense, resulting from the timing of new program launches as well as the timing of event-driven programming in the prior year.","Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter increased 4% to $1.6 billion. Page 11 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 37% to $570 million in the quarter. The increase in theatrical revenues was principally due to the strength of our current quarter's releases, including Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Paranormal Activity 3 and Puss In Boots. Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 6% to approximately $600 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower revenues from third-party distribution titles, partially offset by the performance of Transformers 3 in international market.","TV license fees increased 9% to approximately $300 million. The increase in TV license fees was due to higher pay-TV revenues, partially offset by lower network TV revenues, resulting from a fewer number of titles available in the quarter. Ancillary revenues declined 46% to $92 million. Ancillary revenues faced difficult comparisons as the prior year benefited from the sale of the distribution rights to Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel. Partially offsetting this were higher consumer products and digital revenues.","Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $31 million in the quarter as compared to income of $68 million last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparison to last year's sale of distribution rights to Marvel as well as the timing of P&A expense related to the theatrical release of Mission: Impossible, partially offset by the international home entertainment performance of Transformers 3.","Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX, which was partially offset by losses at our Viacom 18 India TV venture that reflect cost associated with our investments in new channel launches. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thanks, Jimmy, and good morning, everyone. Let's talk about our cash flow, our debt profile, the return of capital to our shareholders as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of free cash flow for the quarter, we generated approximately $600 million in operating free cash flow in the December quarter compared to approximately $700 million last year. Page 4 of the Web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher working capital utilization, partially offset by lower cash taxes. The working capital used in the quarter was primarily due to the timing of theatrical releases, including Mission: Impossible III.","As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost at the quarter end of 5.5%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.","During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rates in the public markets to refinance certain of our higher coupon notes, as well as to maintain our leverage at our target level. We issued $600 million of 3.875% senior notes due in 2021 and $400 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2016. In conjunction with this, we called the $750 million of outstanding of our 6.85% senior notes due in 2055.  The notes were callable at par and were redeemed on January 9. The combination of these actions will lower our interest cost by approximately $20 million on an annual basis.","In addition, during the quarter, we amended our bank line by improving the pricing and extending the maturity date to December 2015, further enhancing our liquidity. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.","At December 31, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.95x. As I just mentioned, we redeemed our 6.85% senior notes on January 9. If you pro forma for the redemption at quarter end, our debt and capital leases outstanding would be $7 billion and our leverage ratio would be 1.8x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 10x.","In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $840 million of capital back to our shareholders in the December quarter. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter. So for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders.","Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, on an annual basis, we continue to see revenue growth in the high single-digit to double-digit range based on 2011 affiliate revenue base, which includes incremental digital agreement. Given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. In the March quarter, we expect the affiliate revenue growth to be in the low-teens.  Our expected growth rate for Media Networks programming expense remains mid- to high-single digits for fiscal 2012. Accordingly, given the pace of programming expense in the December quarter, we anticipate that programming expense will grow in the high-single to low-double-digit percentage range for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Our ongoing expense management will enable us to continue to grow our margin as we invest in our brand. Paramount has achieved global box office success with its latest sequel to the Mission: Impossible franchise. And accordingly, Paramount should see healthy growth in profit in the March quarter as it benefits from the performance of Mission: Impossible as well as from lower print and advertising costs. We continue to expect to realize approximately $100 million in cost savings this year related to the restructuring charge we took back in the September quarter.","For 2012, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. In terms of cash taxes, given the sunsetting in December of tax benefits related to accelerated deductions of films and TV production, we expect cash taxes to mirror book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for the fiscal 2012 year.","Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline. In April, Paramount and Fox will rerelease James Cameron's TITANIC in 3D and in May, the studio will release The Dictator, which stars Sacha Baron Cohen. Paramount will also be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3 in early June.","In addition, the studio has a number of sequels to existing franchises as well as new franchises in development. This summer, the studio will release G.I. Joe 2 and in the fall, they release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. Paramount is working on World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt and One Shot, starring Tom Cruise, which is based on the best-selling novel and Jack Reacher business book series, and J.J. Abrams is currently in production on the next installment of Star Trek.","To wrap up, we continue to operate with the focus on pursuing organic opportunities in our core businesses. And we remain committed to investing in our brand and strengthening their competitive position. This focus on organic investment, combined with disciplined management of our core structure, will enable us to drive earning per share and drive free cash flow. We are encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises. The addition of new distribution partners on digital platforms, the opportunity to grow our international business and profitability and the ability to develop franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth. In addition, we remain committed to an aggressive capital return program of share buyback and dividend, which we believe will drive value for our shareholders over the long-term.","I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Let me have just one general on advertising for anyone who wants answer, then one on Philippe on Nickelodeon. So on advertising, people definitely going to focus on the minus 3 domestic number, and I want to get a sense of how much of that minus 3 was driven by the Nickelodeon problems in the quarter. So what would the growth be? What range of growth would be in advertising, taking out Nickelodeon for the quarter?","Philippe P. Dauman","Michael, if you -- if we haven't had the Nick ratings issue, our advertising sales would have been a growth for the quarter, would have been up rather than down for the quarter. The other factor that impacted ad sales during the quarter was weakness in the scatter market. And looking at individual advertisers, we saw several advertisers that appear to have hold into the upfront some of the scatter money that they would otherwise have spent. So that was something that's hard to measure until we got to the quarter. So we saw people that focused in advertisers that increased their upfront buy and then had a corresponding decrease in their scatter buy in the quarter.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Philippe, would it be safe to assume low-singles, taking out the Nick problems, is that kind of the range of growth?","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then on scatter versus scatter volume, how much was it down, putting aside Nick? When you mentioned the upfront commitments, but just scatter versus scatter volume for you guys for the quarter, how much was that down?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, it was -- I don't want to quantify it exactly, but it was down significantly and particularly at the end of the quarter, and we believe that, that was a reflection of the general market environment. We believe that there were a number of companies that were pulling back on their expenses as they were closing out their year. And we see some of those very same advertisers coming back in this quarter, which leads us to that conclusion.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Are we -- in terms of rate, would you say teens-like in -- teens-types of volume changes?","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then last one would be, you're starting to some press articles about possibly linking Netflix and Netflix' kids product with Nickelodeon's ratings declines. And I wonder now you have more time to look at -- you've had some more time looking at the Nickelodeon rating issues, what can you say about the availability of Nickelodeon content on Netflix and what's -- what that is doing to Nickelodeon ratings?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we look at that very closely. And we don't think that the availability of the limited amount of Nickelodeon library content that we have on Netflix has had a significant impact on the ratings. Again, remember, the Netflix universe is a rather small fraction of the overall television household numbers, number one. And number two, yes, we do get data on our streams and the both the number of Netflix subscribers and the number of Nickelodeon content streams were pretty much the same between the summer and the fall. So there was no real change that accounted for the fall drop, which we did not see in the summer. So there could have been some minimal impact, but it certainly does not account for the range drop that we saw. We -- as I said on the last call, we believe there was some ratings systemic issues. Again, I don't want to belabor it because we did in the last call. But the pretty extensive set-top-box data that we have does in no way reflect what we're seeing in the Nielsen measurement. That being said, that's the environment we're operating in and we're going to attack it as we always do, and which is to go after our audience. And we'll go after that new Nielsen sample and we'll -- the programs will appeal. And I'm confident that as the year progresses, you will see improvement in Nickelodeon's ratings. And again, finally, on that point, it did impact last quarter's ad revenues in a significant way. But as I said again on the last call, that was the significant quarter, where that has a big impact. In the remainder of the fiscal year, we have a low proportion of ad sales that are tied-in to Nickelodeon, and we have more unit availabilities in the quarters than you have in that multi-week period leading up to the holidays in the fourth calendar quarter, our first fiscal quarter.","Operator","And we'll take a question from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Couple questions just on the health of the advertising market. Could you comment? You said things are getting better in the March quarter. I guess could you comment on how you're seeing scatter trend versus the upfront? And any comments on cancellations for the June commitment? I think we're in that period right now. And then secondly, to your point that you have less of a headwind, less of a concentration of Nickelodeon revenues in the March quarter and you said things have picked up a little bit, I guess, any framework on how we should see advertising revenue for the March quarter will be helpful.","Philippe P. Dauman","Alexia, the scatter pricing, for what it's worth, is holding up well. We see scatter-to-scatter pricing up and it's up in the -- I would say now about the mid-single digits and healthy double digit over upfront pricing. Our level of cancellations is probably lower than normal and very low single digits. Again, it reflects people buying, companies buying in the upfront. It's the prices that were attractive compared to the scatter market. And in terms of the framework for the quarter, it is -- our earnings release is quite early in the quarter and given what happened last quarter, I'm going to say it's going to be better and we think it'll be positive. I think it's too early to put a framework on it. But as we get later in the quarter and I'll have opportunities to address investors in a public forum, I'll be able to put a little more boundary around it as we get further along the quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","For Philippe, I think there's a perception that kids sometimes don't care whether a TV show is an original or a repeat and you've been emphasizing the record number of original episodes coming. I was hoping you could provide an empirical solution to that debate. Is there a material difference in ratings between the original episodes and the repeats? And if you have a sense of how much that difference is, that would be helpful.","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, and when we premiere a new episode, it's substantially higher than the repeat. So I gave you some of the numbers on fresh episodes of iCarly and Victorious as an example. We haven't had fresh episodes of SpongeBob recently, but we will be coming on with those. So clearly, whenever we have new material, it draws a substantial viewership. That's why as we layer on more of these new episodes of existing series and we layer on new series, those are the building blocks for building Nick ratings whatever environment we begin with. We start from the base that we have and we will build it up.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","When you mentioned 500 episodes of originals, you don't have handy the similar number from last year, what kind of growth that is year-over-year?","Philippe P. Dauman","It's about 1\/3 more than we had last year, something in that neighborhood, about 30% or low-30s.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And if I could just squeeze one in for Tom. Your guidance for cable network margin expansion for fiscal '12, I'm just wondering what level of cost flexibility you have to achieve that if advertising proves disappointing at all? Or put it another way, if advertising does remain soft the rest of the year, can you still achieve margin expansion in cable networks?","Thomas E. Dooley","Well, it depends on how you define soft. But right now, we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to improve margins on a year-over-year basis with the flexibility that we have and our ability to really control the costs quite well. And I think we've demonstrated that in the past and I think we'll be able to roll that forward into the future unless there's a really horrible ad market.","Operator","We'll take a question from Alan Gould from Evercore Partners.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two questions. First, with respect to the ad revenue in the March quarter, Philippe, I think the Kids' Choice Awards this year are March; last year, that was April, so that should improve the quarter, I think, about 2 percentage points, and then you've got the less Nick seasonality. So doesn't the 2 of those events get you to a positive number in the March quarter before we even consider an improvement in scatter pricing?","Philippe P. Dauman","Alan, yes, as I said, I do expect that we'll have positive ad sales growth performance in the quarter. But it's just too early in the quarter for me to go beyond that, how far positive they will be.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the second question is last year, you started talking about the incremental research that you were doing which was helping the ratings. What's happening with the research now? And how is that impacting the programming and the ratings?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, we continue to invest in research and understanding our audiences better and how they use new platforms, and it's informing our selection of programming on different networks. We have a continued orientation to increasing original programming across many of our networks. In my remarks, I cited a number of examples that really cuts across almost every one of our networks. And in particular, with the youngs-viewing networks, we want to understand how the sensibilities evolve. We are also more and more creating associated content on multiple platforms and creating new features such as WatchWith, which MTV adopted to allow people to get more information on the shows like Jersey Shore while they are watching it and interact with our characters and live tweeting and all of these things. So it's really a funnel, what we're doing now and helping us plan for the future as we develop programming not just for the television screen but across multiple screens.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Well, outside of the measurement issue, how do you explain the remainder of the ratings decline? Was it just more repeats, not enough original programming in the quarter?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, look, there are a number of factors. We -- some of our competition laid in a lot more new shows at a time when we didn't have that many. And obviously, we need to have a competitive response to that and we will. And the -- I mean, the biggest part as far as we can tell is just a discrepancy that we see. There will be some soft adjustment even within the Nielsen universe, given the churn that occurs within the 20,000 households, which constitute the Nielsen household. So there'll be changes there and again, we'll do what we know how to do, which is to -- when we have a ratings issue, we tackle it with more research, more programming, better programming and marketing. And we will make sure that our audiences are aware of our new series launches and our new shows and we'll do it through our own channels, off-air. As I mentioned, a couple of our shows are music-based. They have successful concert tours. So we'll use every weapon in our arsenal and we know how to do this, and we've had issues with various networks. We always turn them around.","Operator","And we have a question from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays Capital.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to kind of continue along the line of questioning on pricing and volume. I think assuming, Philippe, that scatter volume was down in the teens in the December quarter, I just wonder what's the improvement? What's the continuation of that churn in the March quarter on volume setting aside price? I think you spoke to that already.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, again, we are very early in the quarter, I want to stress that, but volumes are improving. And yes, we'd love to provide more specificity, but we don't want to -- I don't want to get some extrapolation this early in the quarter. We're encouraged by the tone out there in the market. And as we get further along in the quarter, we'll be able to put more meat on the bones there, [indiscernible] market evolve.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just taking a step back more broadly, I mean, Viacom is both a seller and a buyer of advertising, given Paramount. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about -- are you seeing anything from your customers? Are you seeing anything in the marketplace that would indicate that display advertising or social media is soaking up any demand out there either in terms of volume or in terms of volume as index to price? Just generally when you look at the marketplace and what advertising buyers are really focusing on these days.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, as a buyer of advertising through Paramount, we certainly view that television is the most effective way to build the brand quickly. And of course, when we launch a movie, we want to build that brand quickly. Clearly, we supplement that with social media. But studio spending, there were a lot of titles in the quarter. Studio spending was strong in this past quarter. That was really not an issue. That's not where the demand problem resided. As far as display advertising online, there's clearly -- within that digital marketplace, there's clearly a lot more availability. You saw the Facebook numbers and how they're growing their display advertising numbers. It's certainly taking the wind out of some of their online competitors in display advertising. And it's certainly impacting pricing display advertising in that there's a much larger availability. There's almost unlimited availability of that kind of advertising as opposed to the somewhat tighter or much tighter television market, where there is scarcity for advertisers who want to be on the top shows, the top networks and the ones where viewers have an affinity to the brand and pay more attention than they do with much of display advertising.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jessica Reif-Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just going to switch gears and ask you about international and hopefully, you can give us some more color on your strategy in growing areas like India, Germany and Latin America. How meaningful will the growth be? Several of your competitors have cited a goal of doubling operating income over the next 2 to 3 years.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you, Jessica. International is a really significant opportunity for us in the long term. I was asked in a December conference to look forward for the company over the next 5 years with the framework, I was asked. And what I said then and I would reiterate today is last year, we did about $200 million of operating income in our international Media Networks. And I expect that to at least triple to quadruple over the next 5 years. And you -- we've reorganized our operations to be much more effective in developing networks and creating revenue opportunities. The digital opportunity international is really significant and opens up avenues for us that were previously closed, where it was more difficult to distribute our content. India is a very successful joint venture. We had great success with the existing networks. We are investing. And as we indicated in our remarks in the last quarter, we -- it was not -- had we just stuck with our existing networks, it would have been a profitable quarter for India, but we chose to invest and build on our strength to launch several networks, and we think we're going to create huge value there. Latin America is a market with a lot of opportunity. We just launched the comedy brand in both Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. So we launched comedy yesterday. We have a lot of opportunities around the world. I think very rapidly in the next 2 to 3 years, you will see in many, many, many countries Paramount channels. The first will be in Spain. We have several others lined up. There's a lot of demand for the library movie channels and of course, Paramount is an exceptional library and brand. So I see a lot of opportunity in emerging markets with opening them up and opportunities in existing markets to launch more of our brands.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And again, switching gears, could you give us an update on your thoughts on distribution for DreamWorks Animation?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, the update is that we're looking forward to the last 2 movies, the last 2 new movies under our deal with Madagascar and Rise of the Guardian at the end of the year. We have valued very much the relationship, thus far, with DreamWorks Animation. Even after the -- these last 2 release of theaters, we will have a long-term continuing relationship as we'll continue to be a distributor for all the movies that have been -- that we have distributed to-date in various windows. It goes for -- I believe, it's 16 years after the release of each movie initially theatrically. And we have many other facets of our relationship with Nickelodeon and the rest, so we have a very powerful lineup going forward. DreamWorks Animation is a successful company, well-led company, and I continue to wish them great success as they move forward from our existing -- the existing nature of our relationship.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then one last thing, a very specific advertising-related question. What is auto advertising as a percent of your total advertising? And what are you seeing in auto in the March quarter?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, auto is a low -- has been a low percentage for us historically. Happily, it is growing at a healthy percentage for us. For us, we have the benefit of the industry, in general, going to smaller car models, appealing to younger consumers. That is our strength. So we're -- we see opportunity in this quarter that we see the auto category growing for us in this quarter and going forward. We think it will grow for -- it will be a continually growing category for us from a low pace. So for us, it's a share opportunity.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Quick question or 2-part question. First on the upfront, just in terms of with Nickelodeon's ratings issues and it sounds like you're still struggling year-over-year in the early part of calendar Q1, given the Nielsen issues. How does it position you? Or what is -- how does it make kind of the upfront in terms of that process, as I know you're obviously going to start kicking off that process over the next few months? And then two, there was a deal signed this morning between Lionsgate and Starz to basically repurpose their movies after the EPIX window, I presume, onto Starz. Curious what your ability to do something similar with Paramount films in a post-EPIX window. I don't think that's something people have really put a lot of thought towards historically versus keeping them on EPIX for the foreseeable future.","Philippe P. Dauman","Nickelodeon, of course, has a -- an overwhelming share of the kids ad market, given that the second position kids network does not sell advertising. So we have sort of the upfront in a position of strength. As I've said, we have a great show lined up for Nickelodeon with more coming, including the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which are soon to launch. We actually had a good event relating to toys there coming up this week. So we're going to have a lot of promotion around that. So our advertisers love Nickelodeon. They see how advertising in Nickelodeon moves their product, and I think that's a good understanding of what the issues are out there. So we expect a strong upfront for Nickelodeon. As far as exploiting our film library, yes, Paramount, yes, of course, and Lionsgate both very committed to EPIX and some of our older library titles. So we are available to license on other paid services and we have been doing well competitively there. This is -- so the Paramount library, which is of extraordinary quality and continue to build on quality with the new films we're releasing is -- will be a mother lode of opportunity for Paramount for many, many years to come and will be the foundation for building some very valuable assets, EPIX in the U.S. and the Paramount film channels around the world, and we continue to look for more opportunities to monetize those film. They are the ultimate form of content, and we look forward to it being our piggy bank for many years to come.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.","Operator","Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation today."],"22108":["Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIAB) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call May 10, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Jim Bombassei - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Bob Bakish - President and Chief Executive Officer","Wade Davis - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Rich Greenfield - BTIG","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Marci Ryvicker - Wolfe Research","Jessica Reif - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","David Miller - Imperial Capital","Tim Nolan - Macquarie Capital","John Hodulik - UBS","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Viacom Fiscal Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to senior vice president of investor relations and treasurer, Mr. Jim Bombassei.","Please go ahead, sir.","Jim Bombassei","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our March quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. We also have an accompanying slide presentation that you can follow, along with our remarks. I want to refer you to the Slide number one in the presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail on our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now I will turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bakish","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us.","During the quarter, Viacom continued to focus on execution and evolution, making significant progress on both. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we made in distribution, where we secured both expanded and new distribution agreements as well as with the quick integration of Pluto TV into our business, where we are already seeing great traction. I will update you on both areas in detail in a moment.","But first, a brief overview of the financials and some key operating highlights from the quarter. Financially, we delivered strong metrics in multiple areas, telling a story of continued momentum at Viacom. Domestic ad revenue improved sequentially to minus 2% year over year as we continue to track our return to full-year 2019 ad revenue growth.","Domestic affiliate revenue, while down slightly this quarter, closed consistent with our expectations and remains on track for full-year growth. Total revenue was a bit soft as we felt the impact of some rather significant international headwinds and timing issues.","That said, we see a strong return to growth in the second half. Notably, at the adjusted OI level, Paramount delivered its ninth straight quarter of improvement and adjusted diluted EPS grew by 3%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Moving to operating highlights.","I want to start with Paramount. Here, we see continued momentum. Paramount improved year-over-year adjusted OI by $20 million, driven by a continued benefit from the performance of Bumblebee and increased monetization of our film library.","Based on this year's slate performance, we continue to expect a return to full-year 2019 profitability. And looking ahead, we are feeling great about the remainder of the significant 2019 releases. Currently in theaters is the adaptation of Stephen King's Pet Sematary, and it's performing well.","At the end of the month is the Elton John musical biopic, Rocketman, which is already generating a ton of positive buzz. And in August, we have Dora and the Lost City of Gold, a live action film from Nickelodeon's Dora the Explorer franchise.","On the TV side, Paramount also continued its success this quarter, scoring a season three renewal of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan from Amazon and a season two pickup of The Haunting of Hill House from Netflix. Second, domestic audience performance. Here in an evolving video landscape, our brands continue to occupy critical market positions and exhibit strong performance, both in pay-TV and beyond.","In the quarter, Viacom maintained the number one share of U.S. basic cable viewing among key demos: kids, teens, 18 to 34s, two to 49s and African-Americans, and we had more top 30 original cable series than any other cable family.","Overall, our flagship networks continue to deliver, growing share 2% year over year, with strong results at Comedy Central, MTV and Paramount Network. And while Nick remains a work in progress, it is still the No.","1 kids network by far and the first shows from Nick's new slate had begun to air with encouraging early signs from The Substitute and Ryan's Mystery Playdate. In fact, we have already ordered season two of Ryan following its strong debut. Looking beyond TV, Viacom digital consumption continues to grow dramatically. In the quarter, Viacom Digital Studios delivered 6.4 billion video views, accounting for watch time of almost 10 billion minutes, up 69% and 153% year over year, respectively.","As part of that, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central both recorded their best quarters ever, and we now rank No. 8 in global social video views according to Tubular's media and entertainment rankings, up from No. 15 a year ago. Third, domestic ad sales.","Domestic ad sales improved sequentially for the second straight quarter, driven by continued strength in Advanced Marketing Solutions, or AMS, which grew revenue 76% year over year. Looking to the full year, we continue to expect our AMS business, now including Pluto TV, to nearly double its revenue in fiscal 2019, representing nearly 20% of domestic ad sales as we bring more new advanced ad inventory online across our growing portfolio.","Importantly, we remain on track to deliver 2019 fiscal full-year domestic ad sales growth and expect to deliver growth in the current quarter. Worth noting, Q3 will be the first quarter of ad sales growth in five years, and the beginning of a new era of ad sales growth at our company.","Fourth, domestic distribution. Here, we achieved significant gain in distribution and are reaffirming our full-year domestic affiliate revenue outlook of low single-digit growth. Our confidence in full-year results is driven by renewals, rate escalators, vMVPD growth, content licensing.","The scaling of our subscription products and inclusion on new mobile and virtual MVPDs, which brings me to two areas I want to spend a bit more time on: distribution and Pluto. They are critical to our continued success and two areas where the transformation of Viacom is clearly coming to life.","Let's start with distribution. Since 2017, we have talked about how consumers would segment by price points across the evolving distribution landscape. And as access to new content package and delivery options has grown, we introduced a strategy to ensure Viacom brands and IP would be represented on all of them.","Our most recent quarter reflects this exact trend and clearly demonstrates Viacom's rapid and successful evolution in this new distribution landscape. At the core of this success is both content, the combination of Viacom's vibrant brands, IP and creative capabilities and partnership, our passion for working with companies and utilizing our assets to create value both for clients and ourselves.","So with that as a backdrop, let's talk about what we achieved in the quarter. First, the big bundle. For the past couple of quarters, there was noise in the industry about what may or may not happen in our AT&T DIRECTV renewal.","And people pointed to this as a big overhang on the stock. Well, as all of you now know, at the end of March, we concluded a new long-term deal with AT&T, which included broad and deep carriage of Viacom brands on both DIRECTV and U-verse, which together represent the largest share of MVPD big bundle subscribers in the industry. In fact including this deal, my management team has now renewed or extended the vast majority of Viacom's traditional sub-base.","Second, virtual MVPDs and skinny packages. This is an important sector of pay-TV industry, and during the quarter, Viacom secured several important wins. Let's start with AT&T. As part of the deal, Viacom ensured ongoing carriage in all legacy DIRECTV NOW packs, and importantly, inclusion in the new DIRECTV NOW Plus and Max offerings. Note that we are the only non-broadcast family to be there other than AT&T's own Turner Networks.","Viacom's global portfolio also gained carriage on FuboTV's live TV streaming service as we have decided to add our leading entertainment portfolio to its previously sports-focused offering. Here, we added over a quarter million new subs as of April.","In addition, Viacom Networks were a core part of the launch of Charter Spectrum TV Essentials, a low-cost entertainment-only bundle targeting broadband-only customers. So we have had a lot of activity in this space, activity which clearly illustrates the value of Viacom networks in skinny bundles.","Third is our expansion in mobile. Over the past two years, we have talked about mobile as a potentially significant growth catalyst for pay-TV content suppliers as mobile telcos look for ways to drive data packages and differentiation.","The good news is we are in the very early stage of seeing that opportunity come to life and Viacom brands are clearly in the mix. As proof points to this, as part of our AT&T DIRECTV renewal, AT&T recently expanded AT&T Watch product to include MTV, Nickelodeon and TV Land.","These networks join the six we launched on the platform last summer. In addition, during the quarter, we announced the content distribution agreement with T-Mobile in which Viacom brands will play a key role in T-Mobile's forthcoming mobile video service.","And remember, T-Mobile now has a subscriber base of over 80 million customers, so this is a partnership with a lot of potential for us. Viacom's activity in mobile also continues to grow outside the U.S.","In fact, Viacom International media networks now has 22 mobile-only content deals with 18 operators across 30 plus countries, a clear sign that our flagship brands are gaining significant traction on mobile networks.","And fourth in distribution is SVOD and direct-to-consumer. Here, we continue to advance our strategy on multiple levels. Our rapidly growing studio production business is speeding a growing pipeline of original content to third-party SVOD players.","For example, in addition to the Paramount TV renewals I mentioned earlier, often the studio premiered PEN15 to rave reviews and announced season two renewals of both PEN15 and Light as a Feather on Hulu. We now are significant original programming suppliers to Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Hulu, among others.","At the same time, in the owned and operated SVOD space, our distribution continues to grow. To that end, Apple recently announced the new Apple TV app will include four of our SVOD services as part of Apple TV channels: Nickelodeon's Noggin, Nick Hits, Comedy Central NOW and MTV Hits.","In addition, outside the U.S., we announced our first Latin American distribution partners for Paramount+, which is our cross-brand streaming video services. With NET and Claro in Brazil. Know that NET is both Brazil's largest MVPD and No. 2 broadband provider, while Claro is among the largest mobile and broadband providers across all of Latin America.","It's also worth noting that Noggin has now passed two and a half million subs globally and that a new enhanced branch is launching this summer, which brings me to the focus of my second detailed topic, Pluto TV. Here, our integration is moving swiftly and going exceptionally well and Pluto's growth is showing strong early momentum.","In fact, since we announced the acquisition, Pluto TV's leadership in free streaming TV has only grown. When we announced the acquisition of Pluto TV in late January, it had 12 million monthly active users.","By the end of April, Pluto TV had approximately 16 million monthly actives, a 31% increase in three months, and we have tens of millions of additional Pluto TV-enabled devices coming online over the next few months, so there is strong growth ahead. And it's not just usage, we are already making demonstrable progress on advertising monetization. Pluto","TV has instantly added billions of ad impressions per month to the Viacom portfolio, and these are high-value impressions. The audience skew is young and is diverse and the impressions are overwhelmingly delivered on a TV glass in long-form premium content, which means it is a high-quality advertising environment.","And while early, we are already seeing positive traction with advertisers, which drove strong scattered volume in March and April. In addition, Pluto TV is also now an integral and compelling part of our upfront offering, helping to differentiate Viacom.","In fact, when you look at Pluto TV in combination with our networks, Viacom has expanded its reach, particularly against hard-to-reach younger demos. For example, with Pluto, we now reached 80% of all 18 to 34s in the U.S.","across our linear, digital and social products. This is the broadest reach we have ever had and with this growth comes greater value for our advertising partners and for Viacom. And speaking of partners, we are also seeing strong early traction with Pluto TV when it comes to distributors. For Viacom, Pluto TV was always more than a D2C play.","We saw this as an opportunity to broaden our partnerships with existing distributors and our early experience has proven just that. Comcast recently announced inclusion of Pluto TV in its Xfinity Flex service, which is available to Internet-only subs, and Pluto TV will be coming to Xfinity X1 soon.","We have a second deal already signed with another large distributor, which we will announce at a later date and a few more in the pipeline. Things are moving quickly as distributors have come to understand the value of extending the Viacom partnership to Pluto TV.","Supporting all of this is our expanding Pluto TV premium content offering. On May 1, we launched Viacom library content on Pluto TV in a big way, adding 14 new channels with more to come.","Viacom's extensive library of iconic IP is now featured through unique categories of branded channels, expanding the Pluto TV content offering. Know that our freshest products remain in the pay-TV domain on our branded networks. In addition, in the last two months, we have significantly grown our roster of content partners, which now number over 150.","Most recently, this includes the addition of CNN, BBC and Major League Soccer, and we see more opportunities ahead, including the July launch of Pluto Latino, a U.S. Hispanic offering which include a set of specialized Spanish language channels, unlocking an entirely new segment for the business, which brings me to Pluto TV's international potential. We see a significant opportunity in leveraging Viacom's global operating footprint to drive Pluto TV's growth.","To that end, we are currently launching the Pluto TV offering in Switzerland and expanding Pluto TV in the U.K., Germany and Austria where it is already launched. In addition, we will have a Latin American launch in calendar 2019 and additional territories in 2020.","And by the way, it's worth noting that the first AVOD product we have got involved with, Viacom18's VOOT service in India just crossed 50 million monthly active users and is now targeting 100 million in the next year. So as you can see, there is a lot going on with Pluto.","But big picture, the thing that really excites us is that we see Pluto TV as an opportunity to create a platform, a platform for content owners to exhibit their IP on, a platform upon which to create a very substantial advertising business, a platform from which to up sell a consumer's targeted SVOD and other products and a platform to work with distributors to create incremental value in broadband, mobile and video sub-bases, both through advertising and by up selling additional video products. It's a powerful idea, and it's a global one.","The best news is we are already on our way, and that is why we are going to lean into it harder and invest some incremental money in 2019 to take advantage of the momentum we are already seeing to capitalize on and extend our early leadership position.","With that, let me turn it over to Wade to take you through our financials.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Bob. As Bob just discussed, we made a lot of progress in the evolution of our company this quarter. What is really exciting for us is our strategies for the transformation of our business, the associated investments that we are making to support these strategies are beginning to pay off at a scale that is now being reflected in our consolidated financial performance.","This momentum will continue to build in the second half of our fiscal year, and we expect it will fully offset any headwinds associated with our linear business and drive overall top-line revenue growth on a constant-currency basis.","On a consolidated basis, which you can see on Slide 9, we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted EPS growth. This growth benefited from the continued improvement in Paramount adjusted OI, lower interest expense from our aggressive deleveraging and the bottom-line impact of our ongoing cost transformation efforts.","Beyond the P&L, we have driven very significant cash flow improvements where year-to-date free cash flow of $642 million is up over $400 million versus the prior year. Moving to the segment results on Slide 10, I will start with filmed entertainment.","The team at Paramount continues to deliver on the turnaround where adjusted OI of $29 million improved $20 million over the prior year, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of OI improvement. This quarter's profitability growth was driven by increased monetization of our library as well as the performance of carryover titles including Bumblebee.","Total filmed entertainment revenue declined 1% as stronger theatrical and ancillary revenue was offset by lower licensing revenue. Theatrical revenue more than tripled, primarily benefiting from the impressive carryover performance of Bumblebee.","Ancillary revenue grew 75% or $38 million due principally to a new music rights agreement. The decline in licensing revenue was a result of the timing of delivery of Paramount TV product as well as comparisons to last year's direct-to-SVOD release of certain films.","Now turning to media networks, which is on Slide 11. My comments on media networks will be in constant currency terms. Please refer to our earnings release for detail on our reported results. Worldwide media networks revenue declined 5% and adjusted operating income declined 4%, where we partially offset revenue declines with lower expenses.","The improvement in expenses was due to the timing and mix of original programming and savings from our cost transformation efforts. Moving to domestic ad sales. The growth rate improved sequentially to a decline of 2% year over year.","The sequential improvement was driven by accelerating growth in Advanced Marketing Solutions, partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of unfavorable impact from Easter falling later this year.","AMS revenues increased 76% in the quarter, compared to 54% in the December quarter. The impact that AMS is having on our domestic ad sales performance is an example of our focus and consistent execution against our stated strategies.","Fiscal 2018 was AMS' first full year of operation and it delivered over $300 million of revenue, and we are on track to nearly double AMS this year where it will represent around 20% of our domestic ad sales business. Given the scale and growth rate of the AMS business, we expect it to fully offset any linear headwinds for the balance of the year, driving full-year domestic ad sales growth.","Domestic affiliate revenue declined 2% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline is largely due to the absence of library licensing to third-party SVOD distributors, which we halted as we finalized our content strategy from Pluto.","Beyond this, contractual rate increases were largely offset by subscriber declines. Taking a step back and as Bob mentioned in his remarks, this was an excellent quarter for us in the execution of our distribution strategy. Deals we secured this quarter significantly derisked the linear component of our business and set us up for consistent and predictable annual contractual rate increases for years to come.","We also executed a number of agreements, providing meaningful incremental penetration on new platforms, which will be an additional source of growth as our networks are lit up from these services.","On Slide 12 of the deck, we have an overview of international media networks where total revenue declined 13% in the quarter. While revenue performance was soft, we have a clear line of sight to meaningful growth in the back half of the year.","International ad sales declined 6% in the quarter while channel size momentum continued, achieving its third consecutive quarter of growth in viewership share. The U.K. ad marketplace continued to be soft given the macroeconomic uncertainty.","Excluding the U.K., international advertising revenues grew 2% in the quarter. Looking ahead, for the June quarter, we expect to return to growth in international ad revenue driven by a handful of specific factors including: modest improvement in the U.K. TV ad market, which we are already seeing; contractual U.K.","ad sales commitments that are not marketplace dependent; and ongoing strong growth at Telefe driven by the political advertising cycle in Argentina. International affiliate revenue was down 13% in the quarter.","The decline was due to the timing of SVOD and OTT deliveries. We have significant deliveries of SVOD and OTT content planned in the back half of the year, which would yield a return to growth in international affiliate revenue.","Now turning back to the consolidated results and looking at the items below the line. Net interest expense was lower by $25 million due to continued deleveraging actions. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5%, which was comparable to the prior year. On Slide 13, there is a summary of our cash flow and debt.","Our free cash flow generation year to date has increased significantly to $642 million, compared to $235 million a year ago. The growth in free cash flow was largely a function of improved working capital management and timing of certain production spend. Moving to the balance sheet.","At quarter end, we had $9 billion of gross debt outstanding, a reduction of 11%, compared to the prior-year quarter. Our adjusted gross debt reflecting the equity credit we received from S&P and Fitch on our hybrid securities was $8.3 billion.","Turning to the remainder of the fiscal year. Now that we have closed on the Pluto transaction and are significantly into the integration phase, we are incorporating the impact of Pluto into our guidance. For the full year, we see total Company revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits on a constant-currency basis, with growth at media networks and filmed entertainment.","This updated guidance reflects slightly lower growth in filmed entertainment revenue than previously anticipated due to shifting in the release dates of certain titles out of FY 2019 and into FY 2020. In terms of domestic affiliate revenue, we reaffirmed our expectations for growth in the low single digits for full-year 2019.","Domestic affiliate revenue will benefit from rate escalators, virtual MVPD growth, content licensing and the scaling of our subscription products. We also continue to expect growth in domestic ad sales for the full year, driven by meaningful growth in the June and September quarters.","While we have seen lower linear impression delivery, principally driven by Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite, this softness will be more than offset by accelerating growth in our AMS business, including the benefit from Pluto TV. As I mentioned earlier, the scale and growth rate of our AMS business is now significant enough to mitigate ecosystem headwinds currently impacting the linear business.","But beyond the growth of AMS, our linear business will benefit in the back half of the year from Easter holiday timing and advertising mix shifts, including increased volume from the studio category, which will result in higher weighted average price increases. Additionally, we expect to benefit from improved viewership share at Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite as the new management team's programming strategy comes on air.","While it's only been two months since we acquired Pluto TV, we have made significant progress on the integration which is already manifesting in the marketplace. The strategic fit, audience momentum and associated financial results are already outperforming our initial expectations.","We continue to see Pluto as $1 billion opportunity as we expand the content offering, grow audience, launch new international services and enhance monetization. Based on the results we are already seeing, we are more bullish than ever. Inclusive of Pluto, the meaningful top-line growth we will be delivering across the board in the second half of the year will require modest incremental investment.","Because of this investment, combined with the macroeconomic headwind that impacted our first half international results and the increased purchase price amortization associated with Pluto, we now expect full-year total company adjusted operating income to decline in the low to mid-single digits.","We continue to expect a return to profitability at filmed entertainment. In wrapping up, I want to note the extent to which the strategies we have implemented to layer growth initiatives on top of a stabilized core business are paying off.","We have been and will continue to be disciplined and relentless in the execution of our stated strategies. We are halfway through our fiscal third quarter and I couldn't feel better about the return to growth that we are seeing across our businesses. And now we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. we will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today is coming from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Greenfield","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I just want to make sure I understand the commentary on the drop from 5% growth in domestic affiliate last quarter year over year to the down 2% this quarter. Is that entire change due to SVOD licensing? Are there other non-recurring? I don't remember you being a big licenser to things like Netflix or Hulu.","So just maybe, I guess, the larger question is, what exactly is in your affiliate revenue line? And how should we think about growth beyond 2019 now that you have renewed almost all of your deals, given that it seems like it's more than just the traditional distribution deals that are in there? So if you could just help us with those pieces, that would be great.","Bob Bakish","Yes. Sure, Rich. Thanks for your questions. So look, first, I want to reiterate what a successful quarter this was for us on the affiliate side as we secured both expanded and new distribution agreements. And the deals we secured in the quarter, including AT&T, really de-risked the linear component of our business and set us up for a consistent and predictable annual contractual rate growth. Now to your question, probably the best way to do it, because you are all trying to do it, is look at Q1 versus Q2. In total, as you know and as you stated, Rich, Q1 at 5% growth versus Q2's minus 2%, within that, the core in Q1 was plus 2% and the core in Q2 is flat and then the balance, the noncore in Q1 was plus 3% and in Q2 is minus 2%. So let's talk about that.","In reverse order, noncore. In Q2, we halted library SVOD licensing as we finalize the Pluto strategy, which cost us 200 basis points versus the prior year. And as I indicated by the numbers in Q1, noncore was a bit of a tailwind. Again, not massively, but it shifted from tailwind to headwind. In terms of the core, looking at Q2, as I just said, it was flat. Within that, subs were negative, in the one and a half to 2% range, which was consistent with our prior quarter. So the driver of the core being flat is really the difference in the quarter is really renewal activity in the second quarter. Beyond that, I can't really say as we take our confidentiality agreements very seriously.","Now pivoting to the future, which is the second part of your question really. In terms of our 2019 outlook, as you know, we reaffirmed low single-digit full-year domestic affiliate growth, and as part of that, we will see sequential improvement in the third quarter. Why do we see that? A number of reasons.","First, we renewed with all major distributors, which means we have predictability in terms of the positive impact of built-in rate escalators. Note that on the subscriber side, we are assuming very modestly higher sub-declines in the back half of the year and this is all incorporated into our guidance. Second, we see continued benefit from vMVPDs, both as we benefit from growth in places where we already work as well as from new deals we struck in the second quarter, which of course include Charter Spectrum TV Essentials, FuboTV and the DIRECTV NOW Plus and Max offerings.","We also anticipate a benefit later in the year from the forthcoming launch from T-Mobile. Third, we will also benefit from our portfolio of subscription products continuing to scale as we have added incremental distribution, including from Apple channels as well as growing our portfolio of offerings, which will include a new version of Noggin and the launch of MTV Hits, both in June.","But stepping back from all this, Rich, this is another example where we clearly articulated the strategy. We have been executing against it, and we are delivering results. And this strategy included broadening our partnerships with our existing distributors to unlock new opportunities and a strategy to accelerate our participation in next-generation platforms, including OTT and mobile, to broaden consumer access to our brands and IP. Both of those elements put together are driving growth in this changing landscape. Both are reflected in our Q2 and, of course, beyond.","Rich Greenfield","And just to be clear, Bob, you are basically saying that 2020, you feel comfortable that in fiscal 2020, you are going to grow affiliates at some level above what you are going to do until you said low single-digit growth for 2019, but you think you are going to do better than that in fiscal 2020?","Bob Bakish","So we talked about 2019 and reaffirm that. We have not given 2020 guidance yet. As we always do, we will give that as part of our fourth quarter call.","Rich Greenfield","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Alexia Quadrani with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi. Thank you very much. Just a question to clarify what you said about the distribution and I have a question on Paramount. On the distribution side, you have mentioned the annual contracted rate increases several times in your prepared remarks.","I just want to clarify, understand it correctly that even if you may have an initial reset to market rate, you may or may not depending on the contract, we can assume that all of your contracts with distributors have some sort of built-in annual rate escalators.","And then just on Paramount, which continues to outperform and do really, really well, better than expected. At this point, have we cycled all the films that were green-lit by the previous management team? And sort of how do you see the balance of sort of film for box office release versus content sold to other venues for the longer term?","Bob Bakish","Sure, Marci. So to your question, yes, all of our affiliate deals have built in annual escalators. They are in the five and a quarter percent range. So yes, that was true before, that continues to be true.","Now with respect to Paramount, let me start by emphasizing just how far Paramount has come. This really is a remarkable turnaround where the team has improved profitability by over $500 million in three years. And under Jim's leadership, this is again an iconic studio where people bring in projects first. The slate going forward is strong, it's really coming together.","It's worth noting that Paramount was really the talk of CinemaCon last month in Vegas. We got incredible excitement showing pieces of Rocketman, Terminator, with Arnold; Gemini Man with Will Smith; Sonic with Jim Carrey; and Top Gun, once again with Tom Cruise's need for speed, just to name a few.","So distributors can't wait, and of course, the TV business continues to ramp quickly. To your question, yes, Wonder Park was the last of the legacy slate. We are feeling great about the studio and its trajectory.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you. Two questions. First, Bob and Wade, you both mentioned that you halted your content licensing strategy as you were closing the Pluto deal. So are you resuming this strategy? Have you changed it? Any update there? And then on Pluto, can you talk about the CPM differential for these ads relative to linear ad? And any number you could put behind this for us. Thanks.","Bob Bakish","Sure. So first, let me apologize to Alexia because I just called her Marci and anyway. Then Marci, hello and thank you for your question.","In terms of library licensing, as we said, we halted that as we finalized our Pluto strategy. And again, it wasn't really material, but it was a piece of business in the comp quarter. On a going-forward basis, what we are going to do is we are going to really continue to work to optimize the return on our library assets.","We are going to look at the performance of those assets on Pluto, which, by the way, in the first very short period has been very strong, and we are going to look at other opportunities should they present themselves. Worth noting that Pluto product tends to be non-exclusive, so we have a lot of flexibility there.","Wade Davis","Yes. And in terms of CPM and a small color around the ad opportunity on Pluto. So in general, digital CPMs are higher than linear CPMs. That is reflective of the ability to target those ads on a more direct basis.","That is the case here with Pluto. We currently see CPMs in kind of the mid-teens to low 20s. The real opportunity with Pluto though is taking advantage of increasing the monetization of that inventory from just selling more of it, right?","So this business, as we said in the past, I mean, the rate at which it's scaling and then audiences engage with the product, I mean, it has billions of monthly impressions and the significant majority of those impressions are growing until today. Obviously for years now, we have had big focus on advanced advertising and Pluto is part of the advanced advertising business.","So the Pluto inventory rolled into the advanced media component of AMS and the investments that we have made in AMS and building out an advanced ad business, building out the sales force that knows to sell these products, integrating it into our upfront cycles, all of these are things that allow us to be highly confident in our ability to take the unsold inventory that Pluto has right now and significantly ramp monetization on that.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jessica Reif with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Jessica Reif","Thank you. I have two questions. Just kind of maybe following on this whole advertising commentary with all the different platforms. Do you have AMS, OpenAP, part of AT&T's results, Comcast? Can you talk about how you use the different platforms? As you renew your distribution deals, there is always an advertising component.","When there is some of your inventories being used for some of the deals, can you talk about who sells the inventory? How does it roll? How do you use that effectively in various distribution deals? And then on Paramount, are you considering or would you consider joining any of the direct-to-consumer services? Some of the ones that have been announced clearly needs scale or is it all being reserved for Pluto? And then as part of Paramount, could you talk a little bit about China? Do you think there'll be any backlash with the current trade situation?","Wade Davis","Do you want me to take that and then you take...","Bob Bakish","Yes.","Wade Davis","I mean, I think the question really is about how our advanced ad sales deals work with our distributors. So as Bob talked about in his earlier remarks, the strategy with our distributors has been to focus on how we can broaden the nature of our relationships with them and bring value beyond and in a way that it's complementary to the core content licensing.","And so obviously, all of the affiliate that any other content companies do have an advertising component. The difference here is that we brought to bear our capabilities with respect to advanced advertising and the products and the technologies that we have, Resident and Vantage, and obviously that integrates with things that we have done like OpenAP.","And the way those deals are structured are really to build out the enablement and the processes that allowed both us and our distributors to be able to capture incremental value from pivoting from linear broadcast ads to advance targetable, addressable media on their footprint.","And so in terms of who actually sells that, we are setting up those processes and procedures to allow both parties to sell them, depending on who can bring the most valued equation at any given time. Paramount?","Bob Bakish","Yes. And just again very simply, Jessica, there has been inventory that was sold by networks, i.e. national, say, Viacom and local since the beginning of time in pay-TV. It was a local veil and national veil.","That continues to be the case today. The operator is still local, we sell national. What is different today, again as we said, is we have now have a direct connection into a subset of the operators' plant which allows it to deliver dynamically different ads into set-top boxes versus all ads being the same, and that gets you all kind of targeting yield and efficiency gain, so that is that.","On the Paramount side, look, Paramount both has a massive library on the film side, and as we said, has real momentum on the current and future slate side. And part of their business is monetizing that content out of, call it, first window.","So if you look at it, led by, in this case, Dan Cohen who runs sales there, we are constantly looking for opportunities to monetize that asset and that includes licensing product to all kind of folks including on the D2C side.","And yes, we are using Paramount product on Pluto as well, and you should expect that hybrid ecosystem to continue as we look to maximize both P&L value and asset value. With respect to China, clearly, a lot of noise about China in the broad market, big negotiation going on, creating some uncertainty.","Look, I believe that will play through. There is huge demand underlying for film product in China. You have seen it become very material as Chinese consumers love American film product. We don't anticipate any kind of long-term problem here. But of course, we will have to see how this trade negotiation plays out exactly.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Miller with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","David Miller","Yes. Hey, guys. Congratulations on the back half guidance there. I appreciate the clarity. Jim, could you just talk briefly about how many Paramount series you expect to deliver in the second half of this year and how many Paramount series you expect to deliver next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Bob Bakish","Yes. So this is Bob, I will take the question. So look, I just said we are tremendously excited about Paramount. That extends to what Nicole Clemens is doing on the television side. As you have seen, we continue to ramp volume there and I will get to the numbers in a second.","But importantly, they really are not just producing volume there producing hits. One title that I didn't mention in my prepared remarks, which I encourage you to check out, is a Catch-22, which we made for Hulu.","The reviews of that series are off the charts and it's yet another example of the fantastic work the Paramount TV team is doing in the space. With respect to call it the numbers, again, very high-growth business.","We now have 22 shows order to or in production, which will be delivered over the coming period. This is a mix of shows for SVOD players like Netflix and Hulu and the like. We are making shows for our own networks including like Boomerang for BDT.","We are making shows for traditional players, cable networks both basic and premium, and there is just a lot of activity there. It is a fast-growth business, creating incredible product that has a very bright road ahead.","David Miller","Okay. and then Bob, on the slate for Paramount for both the back half of this year and into next year for the expensive films like Terminator and Top Gun and so on and so forth, should we assume that most of those are all of those are co-produce with Skydance? Or I mean are you taking our partners to kind of defray the risk there? Or are those purely your films?","Jim Bombassei","Why don't I take the slate question? So as I think everybody knows, we made a decision to pivot away from a slate financing structure a couple of years ago. As we have evolved our slate strategy to really have a balance of being franchise films, co-branded films with our big flagship brands and smaller budgeted, more targeted films, we have decided to really look at it picture-by-picture basis at co-financing opportunities.","And the places that, as you pointed out, you really want to share risk around the bigger budgeted films. And there is no shortage of demand for any of the big franchise films that bring in co-financing partners.","A number of these films are co-financed with Skydance, but they are not the only co-financing partner that we have. But really for everyone and of the big franchise films that we have upcoming in the fiscal 2020 slate, which is a significant number of big exciting films, each one of those more or less has some risk sharing through co-financing partners.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Nollen","Thanks. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Nickelodeon and the turnaround that you have referred to previously there, TV progress they are making at MTV, I think with a bit more of a digital-first strategy there. What are you doing similarly or differently with Nickelodeon? I do see the shared gains you mentioned. But if you could talk a little bit more about the digital versus the linear strategy shift, please?","Bob Bakish","Yes, sure. So big picture, it's important that we note that we did grow our flagship share in the quarter overall and MTV and comedy have really done well. Paramount Network is improving. And BET, we will see some significant benefit as Tyler Perry comes online in the fall.","And by the way, to your point on MTV, it is both a traditional ratings story and a digital story. It's worth noting that MTV's primetime ratings are up on the order of 50% over the last couple of years. So MTV is clearly resonating on television as well as generating pretty extraordinary consumption off television. Now to your question on Nickelodeon, I'm happy to say Brian continues to do great work here.","As you know, he's rebuilt the team and also the pipeline of shows. The first effort to come to air, which is Ryan's Mystery Playdate, has quickly emerged as the No. 1 preschool show on television. And it also actually has broader traction with two to 11s, which is great.","Fully 25% of the audience of the show is new to Nickelodeon, also great. And if you look at the Live+7 lift, which I know is a little esoteric, but it's comparable to PAW Patrol. So that says this show has real potential. And they have a lot more coming.","They will have almost 40% more original hours this summer versus last summer and the stuff looks great. Now beyond TV because as you said and consistent with our flagship strategy, it is about multiple platforms, not just linear TV. And beyond TV, Nick continues to expand as well. Direct-to-consumer side, Noggin had just short of 500,000 U.S. subs in March. That was up 23% versus the prior quarter and over 300% versus a year ago. Also, as I mentioned, we have a new version, which is now in beta, and it will launch in June. That is a significant upgrade from the prior version. It's got a whole new user front end that will improve content discovery. It's got a big added gaming component, which is something obviously consumers love that Noggin hadn't traditionally supplied. And then we also did a bunch of back-end work there to improve scalability. That, of course, won't be viewable by the consumer.","It's not just D2C. Nickelodeon and its studio initiative also closed another animation deal with Netflix for two feature-length versions of RIP, in this case Rocko and Invader Zim. And we are also expanding the portfolio of live events. Most recently, we expanded our the JoJo Siwa D.R.E.A.M. tour by adding dates and markets.","So I'm really excited about what is going on at Nick and looking forward to the quarters ahead.","Tim Nollen","Great. And is there more original programming coming to the virtual bundle deals that you have been doing recently like exclusive original stuff from the likes of MTV, Nickelodeon?","Bob Bakish","Well, our flagship brands have a deep component of original content that are carried wherever those are carried in the pay-TV environment. So yes, that, of course, will continue. I'm not sure what you are referring to in terms of any specific in this virtual bundle point.","Tim Nollen","No, I'm just wondering if there is new digital production going through those virtual bundles from those studios.","Bob Bakish","Well, when you talk about virtual bundle like Charter Spectrum TV...","Tim Nollen","About the mobile. I was thinking more about the mobile deals that you have got like AT&T Watch and some of those.","Bob Bakish","So the AT&T Watch is the traditional vMVPD. It's a entertainment-only skinny pack delivered via mobile. So you can think about that as the same configuration you would get on DIRECTV as an example, just obviously fewer selections, thankfully. We now have nine services on that. So no, there isn't difference there.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","John Hodulik","Great. Maybe first up, Bob, in the way you guys both mentioned some increased investment going into the back half of the year. First, could you size that and maybe give us some more granularity on, is it on the Pluto side or some of the content initiatives that, Bob, you just talked about? And then maybe over on Pluto, yes, the way you talked about 50% of the inventory going on sold and the $1 billion opportunity, is the $1 billion opportunity just fully selling out that inventory at that $20 CPM and maybe executing on the international opportunity? And how quickly can you close that gap and sell that inventory up to 100%? Thanks.","Wade Davis","Sure. Why don't I start with the Pluto piece since it's a little bit with embedded in the modification of our guidance. So yes, I'm going to keep correlating this is a $1 billion opportunity. And when I highlighted it as a $1 billion opportunity, I really want to underscore that that is in the U.S. alone. And when we highlight the $1 billion opportunity, we are just doing simple math on today's users and comparable monetization rates.","And so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in doing more aggressive math, but we highlighted those dynamics when we closed on the transaction, and it was 12 million monthly average unique. Three months later - that was the announcement.","Three months later, it's 16 million monthly average unique. So in three months, it grew 30%. So the momentum continues to grow there. And when we do talk about the $1 billion opportunity on that relatively simple math, that is the domestic market alone.","So as we scale up the infrastructure to accelerate growth internationally, the first material thing you are going to see us do there and it's going to happen in this calendar year is to launch Pluto in Latin America. We are also scaling up the infrastructure to accelerate the fairly nascent services that Pluto had in the U.K. and Germany, Austria, Switzerland countries. So we are excited about this being a global opportunity as well and it's one that really leverages the infrastructure that we have.","In terms of incremental investments and how that impacts our guidance, so there are two pieces that impacted the adjustment to our OI guidance for the year. By far, the biggest of those is accelerating the investments that we are making in our growth initiatives, principally Pluto.","So given the momentum that we talked about, we are going to be making some significant relative to Pluto's spend, not significant in the scheme of things, but we will be making incremental investments in Pluto. Those investments are principally going to be in expanding the team. With respect to the expansion of the team, it's really product and engineering. We are investing money in accelerating the integration process, particularly in the ad tech and data infrastructure areas that allows us to integrate and sell their inventory more fluidly across our entire pools of advertisers, particularly as we enter the upfront.","And then we are going to have a range of incremental product releases over the course of the summer as we continue to improve the product to grow consumption and engagement.","So yes, I guess with that, I'd like to turn it over to Bob just to wrap up the call.","Bob Bakish","Yes. Thanks, Wade, and thanks, everyone, for your questions. Look, as I hope you heard today, the second quarter marked another period of strong execution and evolution at Viacom. We unquestionably have momentum in the core, including having secured meaningful distribution wins, both extending existing relationships and creating new ones in the U.S.","and beyond, which together broaden the footprint of our services. And importantly, we are on track to deliver on key previously stated objectives for the year, including audience share growth for our flagships, a return to full-year advertising and affiliate growth at domestic media networks as well as full-year profitability for Paramount. In addition, we see a strong second half for our international business, including a return to growth. At the same time, in this rapidly changing TV ecosystem, we are leaning more and more into the evolution of our company.","In that regard, we are extremely excited about the consumption of our brands that we are seeing off TV, including across social media and in real life, as well as what we are beginning to see in the mobile distribution space. And there is unquestionable momentum at our key new businesses: AMS, studio production, and of course, D2C, including Pluto TV. These businesses are transforming the composition of our company.","So thanks again for your support. We look forward to continuing to update you as we go through this exciting second half of fiscal 2019.","Jim Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.","Operator","Today's conference has concluded. You may now disconnect your lines at this time."],"22107":["Viacom Inc.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us on our December quarter earnings call. Joining me for today\u2019s discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chris McCarthy, President of MTV, VH1, CMT and Logo.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. We also have an accompanying slide presentation that you can follow along with our remarks.","I want to refer you to the second slide in the presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements it involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today\u2019s remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for joining us.","Viacom today is a story of execution and evolution. And in Q1, we delivered strongly on both, which in turn produced impressive financial results. On a constant currency basis, in Q1, we delivered 4% growth in consolidated revenue, as well as 6% growth in adjusted OI and 13% growth in adjusted diluted EPS. This is the second consecutive quarter that we delivered growth in all three metrics.","Today, I\u2019ll start by briefly taking you through our performance in the quarter, highlighting how the strong execution of our plan delivered across the business, then we\u2019ll dive deep into two topics.","First, MTV, a story of dramatic resurgence and expansion as a definitive multiplatform entertainment brand. You\u2019ll hear the story today directly from the leader who made it happen, Chris McCarthy. And second, our recently signed deal to acquire Pluto TV, the leading free streaming TV service in the U.S. and a key drive of transforming our company for the future.","Both of these deep dives will give you a more detailed understanding of both the execution of our strategy and of our evolution. They will help you understand just how much Viacom has changed and how well-positioned we are for the future. So let\u2019s jump into the quarter, where there are five key headlines.","First, domestic affiliate. This was a very strong story in Q1, up 5% and marking the fourth straight quarter in which we delivered sequential improvement in this business. It\u2019s also the second consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth, driven by contractual rate increases, growth in OTT and studio production revenues, as well as the vMVPD growth. Our strategy is clearly delivering results.","Second, domestic ad sales. As guided, we delivered sequential improvement, driven by higher pricing and strong growth in Advanced Marketing Solutions, or AMS. In Q1, AMS revenues were up 54% year-on-year. On a full-year basis, we expect to see the business nearly double and represent between 15% and 20% of domestic ad sales revenue, as we continue to bring more new and more advanced inventory across our growing portfolio, including from Pluto TV, which I\u2019ll talk more about in a minute.","Third, Paramount, where the turnaround continues to take hold, with the studio delivering double-digit revenue growth and its eight straight quarter of year-on-year adjusted OI improvement. Despite intense competition in the busy holiday box office, we\u2019re pleased with the performance of Bumblebee, which has earned approximately $450 million worldwide. In the process, the film has reset the Transformers franchise and solidly profitable.","Looking ahead, we\u2019re very excited about the 2019 slate. Next up and coming this week is the BET cobranded film What Men Want, an updated spin on What Women Want, a film that leverages both library IP and one of our flagship brands.","Fourth, domestic Media Networks viewership. Here, we maintained the number one share of viewing among key demos and had more top 20 original cable series than any other cable family in the fiscal first quarter. That said, we did lose about a point of revenue-weighted share in the quarter, driven by the larger revenue weight of Nickelodeon in the holiday quarter.","The good news is that despite this, as I mentioned before, we delivered sequential improvement in ad sales, and Nick actually had its strongest share lead in 15 years. Most importantly, Nick\u2019s new President, Brian Robbins is close to unveiling an exciting new content slate that will begin to launch later this year.","In the four months Brian has been onboard, he\u2019s put in new creative leadership and made significant deals with top talent in front of and behind the camera, so stay tuned. Outside of Nick, the brand had a strong quarter. MTV, which you\u2019ll hear more about from Chris, had its seventh straight quarter of prime time share gains, and we\u2019re seeing early positive signs of our network realignment.","Kent Alterman and his team, notched not only the seventh straight quarter of share growth for Comedy Central, but also TV Land\u2019s highest rated Q1 since fiscal 2014 and the first quarter of year-over-year share growth for Paramount Networks in over three years.","The fifth headline is our studio production business. Here, our expansion beyond Paramount Television is really starting to gain traction, and we\u2019re well on our way to achieving our goal of making this $1 billion business in just a few years.","In December, Awesomeness made the exciting announcement that we will develop a sequel to last year\u2019s smash success To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before for Netflix. And over the last several months, Viacom International Studios have announced a string of new deals with Amazon, Claro and more, which will further reinforce our strength in Spanish language content.","Today, I\u2019m pleased to announce that Nickelodeon has struck a new deal with Netflix for its Nickelodeon Studio division to produce two original animated feature films based on two of Nickelodeon\u2019s most important properties, The Loud House and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. This is both incremental business and powerful promotion for the two franchises.","Importantly, this deal is for films-only and does not involve a TV series. Across all five of these areas, what you\u2019re seeing is the positive results of strong execution of our plan, execution, that has returned the company to growth, and execution that is strengthening the positioning of Viacom and increasing its value to consumers and partners.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn to MTV, which really brings to life how all elements of our content strategy come together to make the most of a changing, but expanding entertainment ecosystem and in turn, make the most of this powerful global brand and all the iconic IP under its roof. To do that, I want to introduce Chris McCarthy, President of MTV, VH1, CMT and Logo, who has done an incredible job leading the evolution of this brand.","Chris McCarthy","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m excited to talk about the progress we made at MTV in just two short years. Our story is much like Viacom\u2019s, is one of turnaround and evolution, all good strong execution. So let\u2019s start with a big headline.","This last quarter, MTV closed its six consecutive quarter of prime time ratings growth. That\u2019s our longest streak in our 38-year history and this brings us back to number one as the leading total day cable network for 18 to 34 demo. The brand is clearly resonating. Now, there\u2019s a lot we did to get here and it all centered around the power of the MTV brand and the wealth of our IP.","MTV is a global brand with near universal awareness, that\u2019s in TV and across every platform. And in this increasingly crowded landscape, a powerful and durable brand is a clear advantage. Speaking of advantages, we have a treasure chest of IP with over 200 titles. In fact, MTV has one of the largest libraries of youth and music IP in television, giving us the power to continue to grow more audience and in more places. And our strategy does exactly that, as we aggressively leverage the MTV brand and IP in four key areas.","First, to drive ratings and share growth in our reinvigorated linear network; second, to grow in digital, driving incremental consumption and monetization; third, expand our studio production to beat third-party platforms; and fourth, to extend our presence into live events and experiences. Each of these elements will increase our audience reach, deepen our engagement and drive even more revenue, and together, they will build an even more powerful MTV ecosystem.","Okay, so let\u2019s start with number one. Reinforce and grow our existing cable business. With content at our core, we changed our development execution teams from buyers to builders, which means, we don\u2019t wait for ideas to be pitched to us, we go out and make them ourselves. And why is this important? Because when we build the IP, we own it, which means we can franchise it and we can globalize it. And we can do all of this faster at a lower cost and with a higher success rate.","The result of this new approach have been dramatic. This past calendar year, we launched five of the top 10 biggest new hits in the 18 to 34 demo and nine of the top 10, if you count the shows we built for VH1. We didn\u2019t stop there. We saw a bigger opportunity to broaden our reach to the more lucrative 18 to 49 demo. And so we built shows with that specific goal and they worked.","This past calendar year, we are the fastest-growing network in prime across all cable and broadcast with the 18 to 49 demo, up 22% in ratings and 35% in share. So how does all this work? Well, let me give you an example through one title, our Shore franchise. The Shore is launched in 2009 with Jersey Shore and after six seasons, it went dormant here in the U.S. But our new strategy, we didn\u2019t see an old show, we saw a powerful IP waiting to be reinvented, and that\u2019s exactly what we did.","We built a new extension with Floribama Shore. And with a fresh creative hook, we reimagined the original with Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. Together, they were two of the biggest unscripted hits of the year and they serve two very different purposes. Floribama Shore enabled us to reinforce and grow our existing 18 to 34 audience, while Family Vacation allowed us to broaden our demo to 18 to 49, bringing in 30% new viewers.","Two Shores talking to two different audiences proving more ways to grow and that\u2019s just one IP. And because we\u2019re making it all ourselves, we did it faster. Family Vacation went from concept to air in just three months. With several new Shore extensions in development and you can look out for us to launch at least one more this year. Not only faster, but we\u2019re doing it for less, which allows us to add more premier hours of content each week with no additional programming dollars.","And why is this important? Because more hours allow us to make up for the changes in the cable universe. In fact, we\u2019ve increased our prime time premier hours by 16% over the last two years, and we still have lots of room to grow. This also frees up resources to build new hits like we did with Siesta Key, How Far Is Tattoo Far? And X on the Beach, and all of this is just cable.","So let\u2019s move on to the second part of our strategy, extend off cable. Because content consumption is growing everywhere, it\u2019s not about either\/or, it\u2019s all about more. We can grow everywhere through the power of our IP. Take for example our show, Wild \u2018N Out, which is a top three cable series with young men.","Over the last two years, we\u2019ve successfully increased its share on cable by nearly 50% in the 18 to 34 demo, but we wanted more. And so we launched the Wild \u2018N Out channel on YouTube this past summer and it\u2019s already the number two hip-hop channel with subs. And even better, we\u2019re number one in that same category with views per video in just six months.","This new channel is a great example of how we extend our IP beyond cable to increase our audience, one, that is five years younger than our linear viewers. And all of this gives us even more ways to monetize through more advertising and more sponsorship integration. At the same time, we launched MTV Studios in order to capitalize on a growing number of platforms and the wealth of our IP, which is number three in our strategy for growth, studio production. Here, we\u2019re already seeing results.","We recently announced a new deal with Facebook Watch, the largest community platform to redevelop the real world for a new generation in a new platform in three geographical territories, all integrating the community functionality of Facebook. This shifts the perceived competitor into our newest customer and it increases our reach and revenue. You can expect to see us do more deals like this going forward.","Finally, the fourth leg in our strategy is to broaden our audience with live events and experiences. This March, we are bringing back Spring Break with a three-day global event from Cancun, Mexico, where we\u2019ll be broadcasting across all of our platforms. And we recently acquired a new event, SnowGlobe, the largest winter music festival in the U.S., which we plan to expand with more locations in 2019.","Collectively, these examples prove we are truly having expanding multiplatform MTV, and the best part, our team is just getting started. Today, we\u2019re using less than 10% of our 200 titles and, of course, we\u2019re launching many new titles of IP, proving we have a lot more room to grow across cable, digital, studio production and experiences, all broadening our audience, our reach and our monetization opportunities. It\u2019s truly an exciting time at MTV, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to lead this world-class team.","Thank you again for your time today, and let me turn it back to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Chris. Next, I want to tell you more about our recent agreement to acquire Pluto TV. While the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is not expected to close until March, we think it will be a true game changer in driving the evolution of this company and ultimately creating significant value across our business.","Let\u2019s start with what Pluto TV is. It\u2019s the largest free streaming TV platform in the U.S. It has more than 12 million monthly active users at the end of December, 7.5 million of which are on connected TVs and it\u2019s growing quickly. It\u2019s a very differentiated product in market, featuring more than 100 linear channels, supplemented by an over 5,000 hour VOD library across a broad array of genres, including movies, news, sports, general entertainment and more.","This content is sourced from more than 130 partnerships with Media Networks, major film and television studios, including Paramount Pictures and Awesomeness and digital content producers. It\u2019s available across devices, including on mobile, desktops, streaming players and game consoles. In fact, it\u2019s the number two free app on Roku. And Pluto TV is also deeply integrated with a growing number of smart TVs, including Samsung and Vizio, which represent about 60% of the smart TV market.","But what\u2019s really exciting is how Pluto TV will fit into an accelerated Viacom\u2019s evolution and vice versa. As we\u2019ve been telling you for sometime, we\u2019ve been focused on developing a differentiated direct-to-consumer streaming service that would exploit our considerable content library and leverage our unique advertiser capabilities and relationships. Pluto TV fits squarely into that strategy.","Let me specifically highlight six key points. First, Pluto TV will instantly give Viacom a scale B2C offering with differentiated distribution. That includes direct access to more than 12 million monthly active users and Pluto TV is expected to be enabled on more than 30 million additional devices over the coming months.","Pluto TV will also serve as a very important marketing engine to acquire and retain consumers for our targeted SVOD products, like Noggin; Comedy Central Now; and our new product for older kids, Nick Hits, which launched last week on Amazon channels. And Pluto TV gives us the ability to promote our brands and content that live on other platforms as well.","Second, Pluto TV will meaningfully enhance Viacom\u2019s AMS business. Over the course of 2019, Pluto TV will add billions of addressable advertising impressions per month. And importantly, these are very high-quality impressions. The majority of Pluto TV\u2019s viewers on the TV glass, a highly desirable environment for advertisers. And the Pluto TV audience is young, gender-balanced and hard to reach.","In fact, 50% of Pluto TV viewers are between the ages of 18 and 34. Importantly, Pluto TV with its nascent ad sales force currently sells less than 50% of this inventory. So there\u2019s plenty of upside here.","Third, Pluto TV will add an important offering for our distribution partners. As I\u2019ve said before, the video marketplace will continue to segment across price points, and we want to play in all of them, including free and help ensure our partners do too. Pluto TV will be a platform to expand our distribution partnerships, adding a free offering that can create value across the whole subscriber base, including importantly, broadband-only subs.","We see this as a key new offering for our partners that can serve to increase the value of that service, retain customers and provide a platform from which to selling additional services, including basic pay-TV. Note that this represents a significant opportunity for all types of distributors, including mobile operators.","Fourth, the deal will unlock large library value for Viacom. As you know, we made the strategic decision two years ago to curtail the licensing of large library packages to SVOD with our streaming service in mind. As a result, we have lots of content to work with.","Pluto TV will create additional upside for us going forward, as we tap into content that is not currently being monetized. Importantly, Viacom\u2019s current window programming will remain in the pay-TV ecosystem on our branded networks.","Fifth, Pluto TV is a significant global opportunity. We will leverage Viacom\u2019s reach, infrastructure and capabilities to expand Pluto TV globally. In particular, we see a very compelling near-term opportunity to create a Spanish language offering. We have very deep content assets, including Spanish language versions of our Media Networks original IP, as well as Latin American originals, including from Telefe.","U.S. Hispanic is a large and quickly growing market and a wide open space with no significant streaming service currently dedicated to this audience. We plan to roll out in the U.S. later this year with LatAm to follow.","Six and lastly, Viacom can accelerate Pluto TV\u2019s leadership in free streaming TV. Viacom content will strengthen Pluto TV\u2019s consumer offering across key genres, including kids, African-American, reality and comedy. And the platform will have access to our brands and marketing capabilities to grow audience and usage as Pluto has had modest marketing in the past. In turn, we believe we will deliver incremental value to Pluto TV\u2019s existing content and distribution partners.","In short, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about Pluto TV, the product, the team and the technology and the role it will play in accelerating the evolution of Viacom.","I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Wade Davis to take you through the financials. Wade?","Wade Davis","Thanks, Bob. This strong execution against our strategic initiatives across our existing and emerging business is driving the momentum we\u2019re seeing in the underlying financial results. These results demonstrate our ability to leverage content, IP and brands as the core engines, driving our evolution and we continue to monetize these assets through an increasingly broad range of multiplatform strategies.","Before I get into the adjusted results, I want to note a couple of things. In the quarter, we recognized pre-tax charges of $148 million, primarily related to recent management changes and reorganization at Media Networks. We also changed the presentation of revenues at Media Networks, reclassifying syndication and download to own revenues from what was formerly known as ancillary revenue to affiliate revenues.","With that change, we renamed ancillary revenues to consumer products, recreation and live. The reclassification is not expected to have a material impact on our affiliate growth rate, and a detailed reconciliation of the impact is provided in our trending schedules.","Now, turning to consolidated results on Slide 13 of our presentation. As Bob mentioned, we had a very strong quarter. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 4%, adjusted OI increased 6% and adjusted diluted EPS grew 13%. On a reported basis, revenues grew 1%, adjusted OI grew 4% and adjusted diluted EPS grew 9%, reflecting the impact of currency headwinds. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in adjusted diluted EPS.","The strength of these overall results were driven by growth in worldwide affiliate, Filmed Entertainment revenues, benefits from our cost transformation efforts, continued year-over-year improvement in Filmed Entertainment operating income and lower interest expense due to our deleveraging actions.","Moving to the segment results on Slide 14. I\u2019ll start with Filmed Entertainment, which continues to gain momentum and achieve success at the box office and beyond. Paramount delivered its eight consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted OI improvement, up $40 million versus the prior year. The continued roll out of the new slate, as well as ongoing growth from TV production contributed to the strong performance.","In addition, the quarter benefited from the licensing of the Paramount brand and IP in the theme parks and is reflective of the global power of these assets. Total revenues grew 14%, driven by the strength in theatrical TV production and ancillary revenues. Theatrical revenue grew 49%, driven principally by the performance of Bumblebee and Instant Family.","Licensing revenues were up 3%, driven by an 84% increase in revenue at Paramount TV with the deliveries of a number of successful series in the quarter, including The Haunting of Hill House. Lastly, growth in ancillary revenues of 54% was principally driven by license fees related to the development of two Paramount branded theme parks in Asia.","Now turning to Media Networks, which is on Slide 15. In the quarter, we had continued momentum with growth in worldwide affiliate revenue, sequential improvement in the domestic ad sales growth rate, accelerating growth in our Advanced Marketing Solutions business and growth in adjusted OI on a constant currency basis.","Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, worldwide revenues were flat, as growth in domestic affiliate revenues was largely offset by declines in domestic advertising. The decline in worldwide reported revenue was driven by foreign currency headwinds.","Adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis grew 2%, driven by lower overall expenses. On a reported basis, the impact of FX caused reported OI to be flat. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 5% in the quarter, which follows 3% growth in the September quarter and marks the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Growth in the quarter was driven by contractual rate increases, growth in virtual MVPDs, OTT and studio production revenues.","We continue to benefit from the multiplatform expansion of products tied to our IP, including the continued success from Noggin\u2019s launch on Amazon channels, as well as our Bellator partnership with DAZN. The domestic ad sales growth rate improved to 100 basis points sequentially to a decline of 3% on a year-over-year basis.","The sequential improvement was driven by accelerating growth in our Advanced Marketing Solutions business. AMS revenues grew 54% in the quarter, compared to 32% in the prior quarter and now represents over 10% of domestic ad sales.","Turning to International Media Networks on Slide 16. Total revenue was flat in the quarter, excluding a 10 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency. International ad sales on a constant currency basis were flat in the quarter, which is a 300 basis point improvement in the growth rate from the September quarter.","Strength in Latin America driven by Telefe was offset by weakness in the UK. While Channel 5 delivered another quarter of expanded viewership share, the UK advertising marketplace continued to face headwinds, given the macro economic uncertainty. On a reported basis, the decline in international ad sales was due to a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.","International affiliate revenues on a constant currency basis were flat in the quarter. Rate increases, channel launches and increased subs were offset by the timing of SVOD and OTT deliveries. The reported international affiliate growth rate was impacted by a 7 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange.","Moving to worldwide CP, rec and live revenue, which declined 10% in the quarter on a constant currency basis. The decline reflected comparisons to the successful prior year release of the South Park game, Fractured But Whole. Total Media Networks expense, excluding the impact of foreign currency was lowered by 1%, while reported expenses declined 4%.","We continue to invest in our growth initiatives, which drove a double-digit increase in distribution and other expenses. However, overall expenses were lower as we continue to benefit from our cost transformation initiatives, as well as lower advertising promotion expense.","Moving below the line. Net interest expense was lower by $20 million, due to our continued deleveraging efforts. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 24.5%, which was comparable to the prior year.","Now turning to free cash flow and debt on Slide 17. In the quarter, we generated $191 million of free cash flow, compared to a cash use of $16 million last year. This $207 million improvement was driven by better working capital, higher adjusted operating income and lower interest expense.","Moving to the balance sheet. In the quarter, we completed an upsized tender offer for $1.1 billion of senior notes and debentures. This enabled us to reduce our leverage by approximately half a turn compared to last December. Since we began our deleveraging strategy two years ago, we reduced debt by approximately $4.2 billion, or 32%, significantly improving our credit profile.","At quarter-end, we had $9 billion of gross debt outstanding, which compares to $10.2 billion in the prior year. Taking into consideration the equity credit we received from S&P and Fitch on our hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter-end was $8.3 billion.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our views on the remainder of fiscal 2019. Before I get into the specifics, I want to note a couple of things on our recently announced agreement to acquire Pluto TV. While we expect Pluto TV to be accretive to revenue growth and slightly dilutive to earnings in fiscal 2019, the financial impact will be dictated by the closing date in the integration timeline. Given that we don\u2019t anticipate closing until March, it will not materially impact our March quarter financials. Assuming we\u2019ve closed the transaction, we\u2019ll provide more specific guidance related to the impact of Pluto TV on our next call.","Now, turning to our full-year guidance. We had a strong start to the year and we continue to see full-year 2019 total company revenue growth in the mid single digits on a constant currency basis, with growth at both domestic and International Media Networks, as well as the Filmed Entertainment.","I want to note a few things on our key revenue lines. In terms of domestic advertising for the March quarter, with the Easter holiday following later than it did in the prior year, we expect this will have a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points on domestic ad sales performance in the quarter.","Accordingly, we anticipate that the March quarter domestic ad sales performance will be similar to the December quarter. We continue to expect full-year growth in domestic ad sales, driven by meaningful growth in Q3 and Q4. In the back-half of the year, we anticipate significantly benefiting from advertiser mix shifts, including increased volume from the studio category and Easter holiday timing, which results in higher weighted average price increases.","We also expect to benefit from an acceleration in our high-growth AMS business and from improved audience delivery as the new management team\u2019s programming strategy comes on air in Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite.","Additionally, Pluto TV will be an important part of our ad sales opportunity going forward and serve as a complement to our linear and AMS offerings. It will provide a rapidly growing source of billions of monthly advanced TV impressions in young and hard-to-reach demos in a premium and safe environment.","While the precise in-year impact of Pluto TV will not be determined till after we close on the acquisition, it will be a contributor to our expected full-year growth in domestic ad sales. The 5% growth in domestic affiliate revenue in the quarter is a significant over delivery, which reinforces our confidence in 2019 full-year expectation.","We continue to see low single-digit growth for the fiscal year, as we benefit from rate escalators, the multiplatform expansion of products based on our IP and continued virtual MVPD growth. We continue to see total company adjusted operating income growth in the low single digits, with a return to profitability at Filed Entertainment and low single-digit decline at Media Networks.","We also continue to see full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth incrementally faster than adjusted OI growth. We feel great about the momentum we have, and these impressive Q1 results set us up well for what\u2019s ahead. I\u2019m really proud of how well our teams are executing across all dimensions of our business, and I look forward to welcoming the Pluto TV team to the family.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bob to wrap up.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Wade. So taking a step back, strong execution is clearly producing results across the business. Our domestic portfolio as a whole continues to lead key demos and we have a large volume of important hits across the brands. That includes MTV, which two years ago, I think, many had written off. It\u2019s once again a market leader with significant opportunity to capture across the ecosystem.","At the same time, Paramount has really gained its footing, both in film and television. And internationally, our brands continue to resonate and our share is growing. Execution has also been about evolving the business, ensuring Viacom\u2019s competitiveness and relevance in this changing landscape. In ad sales, we created Advanced Marketing Solutions from the ground up, and it\u2019s quickly becoming a significant force.","The same goes for studio production, with multiple studios up and running, delivering premium high-quality content to a growing roster of Tier 1 partners. And our pending acquisition of Pluto TV will be the next big step in the evolution of this company. What\u2019s most exciting is that, this is a highly differentiated asset that fits incredibly well with Viacom. It\u2019s integral to many things we already do, while also incremental in terms of market reach and capabilities.","The cumulative success of both our strategy and strong execution is clearly reflected in our improving financial performance, as you can see from Q1 in which we achieved growth in revenue, adjusted OI and adjusted diluted EPS for the second straight quarter, and something we\u2019re also on track to deliver for the full-year. It\u2019s an exciting time at Viacom, and we look forward to the road ahead.","Thank you as always for your continued support. We\u2019ll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you very much. My first question is just really on the advertising growth that you guys are \u2013 you guys had talked about as acceleration in the back-half of the fiscal year \u2013 second-half of fiscal year, along with the drivers, I think, Wade, that you outlined. I guess, how much are you sort of depended on Nickelodeon\u2019s ratings to improve? And I guess, by how much sort of worth of fee advertising growth turn positive? And what is sort of a realistic timeline for Brian \u2013 Brian\u2019s changes to take effect before we see a positive turn?","Wade Davis","Thanks, Alexia. Yes. So we\u2019re fairly confident in the return to growth in the second-half of the year. It\u2019s not just similar for what we saw last year. The three levers just to reiterate a little bit what I said on the call, number one is the delivery of linear impressions, number two is the pricing we\u2019re seeing on linear, and three is the benefit from \u2013 that we\u2019re seeing from rapid growth in the AMS line.","As it relates to the delivery of linear impressions, I do think it\u2019s important to note that when we\u2019re building up, when we\u2019re looking at the balance of the year, we\u2019re not expecting any improvements in the underlying pay-TV headwinds that are somewhat impacting us from a usage standpoint. But we do expect modest improvement in overall delivery across the portfolio with specific improvement at Nick that you referenced, I\u2019ll come back to the \u2013 to that in a minute.","With respect to the pricing, we have a very direct line of sight in terms of how the better upfront pricing layers in over the balance of the year, with the material improvements showing up in Q3 and Q4. And this is really \u2013 it\u2019s overwhelming \u2013 overwhelmingly a function of the shift in the category mix and the weighting impact of the higher-priced studio spend coming in, in the back-half of the year. And we also picked up some additional benefits from incremental Easter volume just given where that falls this year.","As it relates to AMS, that is a big part of the second-half growth story. I think, the strong performance that we had in the quarter really underscores the momentum that we have there, and we are definitely on track to deliver the guidance that we had provided, which is nearly doubling the overall revenue of that business from 2018.","And when you think about a business that\u2019s naturally doubling over that period, just the kind of mathematical impact of that trajectory is naturally weighted to the back-half of the year. And then, although, Pluto will be additive in the year, it does really provide us incremental confidence in achieving the full-year revenue growth, particularly in the event that we see incremental weakness show up in the linear impressions delivery.","As it relates to the specific Nickelodeon impact and how we get there, I think, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob for that.","Robert Bakish","Yes. So at Nick, we are projecting a modest improvement. And clearly, Nickelodeon was a headwind in this quarter. But it\u2019s also true that we have taken and continue to take decisive action. You referenced Brian Robbins. He has been in the seat now roughly four months. He is a proven executive with deep traditional and digital experience, both in kids and beyond.","He\u2019s already extensively overhauled. The team has got new leadership in live action, animation, programming and scheduling and talent, among other areas. And that team has developed a new slate, including importantly programming coming later this fiscal year. That slate is going to be announced next week at Toy Fair here in New York, so stay tuned for that.","I do think it\u2019s also worth noting that, Nickelodeon did have some notable achievements in fiscal Q1. It had its largest competitive week in more than 15 years and was obviously the number one network for kids in this case for the 14th consecutive quarter. So in the pay-TV ecosystem, Nick matters more than ever. It also had two \u2013 launched two new preschool series, which are looking like hits. Those are Butterbean\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and Abby Hatcher. And beyond TV, it continues its expansion, which is key to the future.","On the digital side, it had its best month ever in the quarter. In direct-to-consumer, we\u2019ll launch Noggin 2.0 in fiscal Q2. That will be a launch partner for Roku channels, by the way. Last week, we announced another service, which is Nick Hits, which we\u2019re starting distributing on Amazon. And the studios business is off on its way. It\u2019s creating partner content for Tier 1 partners.","Today, I mentioned that we signed a new deal with Netflix to produce theatrical releases based on Loud House and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So, yes Nickelodeon has been a headwind, but we\u2019re all over it. I love what Brian and his is doing, and we do see the light at the end of the tunnel starting to appear.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Chris. You mentioned a lot of the work you\u2019re doing for the digital platforms with MTV. Any color you can give us on how you can monetize the work you\u2019re doing on YouTube and such?","Chris McCarthy","Hey, Alexia, sure. As we talked about on my remarks, the MTV brand has near universal awareness. And that\u2019s not just on cable, it\u2019s across every platform. In the U.S. alone, we have 98% awareness. So, when we look at the total ecosystem, it\u2019s about managing the brand with each platform playing a specific role, but adding value, increasing our audience and all the while towards \u2013 an eye towards optimizing monetization.","So you take the Wild \u2018N Out example. For us, that\u2019s a perfect example of our build model, where we made the content. We\u2019re making more hours for less cost, and that allows us to extend into new platforms. Just this \u2013 the year, we launched the Wild \u2018N Out channel, with 3.7 million followers, and that\u2019s with no new expense. So that\u2019s all incremental audience and incremental revenue, and you can see us look to do more things like that as we manage the total ecosystem.","Wade Davis","Yes, Alexia, just to jump in closing, I think, we are actually having a lot of success with respect to monetization. I think, there\u2019s a lot of people write about and think about the challenges around monetizing on some of these platforms. But multiplatform for MTV is already quite material. In totality, the revenue associated with all the activities on the platforms that Chris has talked about will be well over $100 million for FY 2019.","Alexia Quadrani","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Marci Ryvicker","Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about your direct-to-consumer strategy. It feels like it\u2019s a bit different than some of the really large scale ones we\u2019re hearing from Disney and maybe NBCU with a little bit less risk and maybe a higher probability of success?","Robert Bakish","Yes. Thanks, Marci. Well, look, Pluto TV is a game changer for us in B2C. It\u2019s a strong strategic fit with our company and it\u2019s going to accelerate our evolution on multiple levels. Big picture, it\u2019s a scale DTC play. That\u2019s a cornerstone for our broader portfolio of targeted SVOD services. It has massive incremental advanced advertising inventory, and it\u2019s a platform to broaden our distribution partnerships, all ultimately on a global basis.","And when we look at it, there\u2019s clear upside in the ad space. As we said, significantly more than half of this inventory goes completely unsold today. And remember, all this inventory is digital and targeted and most of it is delivered in a TV glass environment.","On the distribution side, on their own, Pluto TV has great momentum and differentiated placement, and we expect Pluto TV to be enabled on an additional $30 million devices over the coming months. Add to that at its core, we see it as playing a role in our expanded partnership with MVPDs and really being an incremental lever to pull on all our deals going forward, as it\u2019ll be able to add additional value to the whole subscriber base, including importantly, broadband-only.","On the consumption side, our strategic decision to curtail large-scale library licensing to the SVOD players over the last couple of years, it cost us some money in fiscal 2017 and 2018, but it means that we have large volumes of content to bring to bear now once we close the Pluto transaction.","And finally, there is a significant product expansion opportunity here, both in the U.S., I talked about U.S. Hispanic, which will launch in 2019 and globally, leveraging our overall infrastructure and capabilities. So you\u2019re right, this is a differentiated approach to the B2C space. It\u2019s both incremental in that regard, but it\u2019s also integral to many other things we\u2019re doing. We think it\u2019s very financially disciplined transaction, will create value in terms of the multiples of the purchase price. So we\u2019re truly excited about the Pluto transaction. We look forward to closing it in March and being off to the races.","Wade Davis","Yes. And Marci, just to give a little bit more context, when Bob talked about the value creation opportunity for our shareholders being multiples of what we paid for it. When you think about just in the ad space alone, we think this is a $1 billion opportunity. And in terms of how you guys should think about this unfolding, Bob talked about this is really a massively under monetized asset, where significantly more than half of the inventory today is going completely unsold.","If you look at some of the comps in the marketplace, they\u2019re monetizing at $3 to $5 per user per month, and some of them range into the teens. And if you apply those monetization comps to Pluto\u2019s audience even today, you get really big numbers. In terms of closing that monetization gap, the leadership that we have in AMS, advanced TV advertising, those client relationships should help us get to those monetization levels pretty quickly.","And then if you think about on top of closing the monetization gap, the audience on the \u2013 Pluto\u2019s audience today, the audience is growing rapidly on an organic basis, and that\u2019s another place that we see Viacom being able to move the needle on. And then this is delivering on these synergies. It\u2019s something that we have experienced doing and a strong track record. We\u2019ve done a number of acquisitions that we\u2019re very targeted on \u2013 along the lines of our strategic plan, and we\u2019ve been able to very effectively integrate the acquired businesses and deliver on the synergies and value creation opportunity that we\u2019ve done in the past.","Marci Ryvicker","Great. Thank you. And then I just want to clarify one thing. Domestic advertising, which shows sequential improvement in the quarter if it weren\u2019t for the timing of Easter, that\u2019s kind of what you\u2019re saying, right?","Wade Davis","For Q2, yes.","Marci Ryvicker","Yes. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Richard Greenfield","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ve got a couple. First, I think every investor that goes and meets with AT&T comes away thinking that Viacom is essentially dead man walking in your negotiation that\u2019s coming up. Yet on the other hand on their conference call, AT&T talked substantially about growth expectations in 2019 for AT&T Watch. And I think you\u2019re a pretty substantial part of AT&T Watch with five or so channels in the package.","Just wondering like how do you think or how do you reconcile the \u2013 what investors are perceiving in terms of your conversations with AT&T versus what actually happens? And maybe just from a larger standpoint, how are distribution conversations changing? I know historically, we\u2019ve all been obsessed with rate. But it sounds like advanced advertising now Wade is talking about Pluto, how do all these things come to bear rather than just a pure rate conversation? And then I got a follow-up for Chris.","Robert Bakish","Yes. Sure, Rich, thanks. Look, as you might expect, I\u2019m not going to comment on a specific company, but let\u2019s talk big picture around renewals. We\u2019ve come a long way in the past two years. We have a distribution strategy, which is proven to be successful despite or perhaps because of the pressures on the ecosystem. We\u2019ve used that strategy to renew or extend over half of our sub base with no blackouts, and we actually gain back incremental distribution, including on Suddenlink.","In parallel, our brand performance has strengthened. You\u2019ve heard the MTV story from Chris. And more broadly, again, in the first quarter, we continue to have the number one share among key demos and had more top 20 original series than any other cable family.","And as I said on an earlier response, Nick had the largest lead in 15 years in share, so Nick matters more than ever in today\u2019s pay-TV ecosystem. Also our relationships across the industry, including with folks like Charter, Comcast, AT&T and Altice among others, are materially stronger than they were two years ago.","And finally, we now have a powerful new piece to add to the equation, which of course is Pluto TV. So I like our hand. I know there\u2019s a lot of noise on this, but I like our hand. The video business is clearly competitive. Consumers have choice, not having Viacom services in basic has proven to be a disadvantage. Remember what happened when Suddenlink added back our services. Connect rates improved by 10% and video bundle time spent increased by over 10%. That was public disclosure from them, not us.","And as the ecosystem involves, Rich, to your point, conversations are becoming less about simply rate and more about creating and adding value and driving this industry forward. And we have more value-creating levers than ever, all of which are proven and available today or in the case of Pluto TV on closing. So again, I know there\u2019s a lot of noise on this, but I like our hand. And to your point, it\u2019s actually we have six services on AT&T Watch, not five.","Richard Greenfield","Chris, you made a comment about kind of returning to being number one in 18 to 34. I think, there\u2019s probably a lot of people listening who go, that\u2019s great. But there\u2019s a lot less 18 to 34-year olds watching TV or that, I think, there\u2019s a perception that the youth demo has essentially moved away from watching linear TV.","Yet when I look at MTV on Instagram, you have a massive following of like 10 million followers, and there seems to be still some vibrant following of the MTV brand among kind of youth culture. How do you \u2013 how would you reconcile kind of what\u2019s going on on TV versus what you\u2019re doing on digital?","Chris McCarthy","Hey, Rich, thanks for the question. We look at the entire ecosystem and for us, it\u2019s about growth across each one of them. The MTV brand is strong, not just on cable, but it is a strong 98% across every platform.","So, cable is our biggest platform, so we had a start there and we had great growth. So we feel like we\u2019d be able to continue to grow that. We have six consecutive quarters. We\u2019re on track to hit our seventh and continue to launch more hits. So we feel really good about our strategy and continue to grow, both in the 18 to 34, but also the 18 to 49.","And to your second point around, where we\u2019re growing the other platforms, that\u2019s our full strategy, right? And we\u2019re planning on growing on each. Our \u2013 take, for example, the Wild \u2018N Out channel that we launched. It already has 3.7 million followers and it\u2019s number one in the hip-hop category with views for a video.","In addition, you talked about Instagram. In that show alone, we\u2019ve increased dramatically just in this last year. We went from nearly 1 million followers to roughly around 2.7 million followers, and our streams and views on that are up over 500%. So you can see how one IP can really drive multiple platforms, and it\u2019s about reaching the audience where they are. So we feel confident that we can reach both the young audience and the young at heart with 18 to 49 across all the platforms moving forward.","Richard Greenfield","And you\u2019ve got Real World launching soon?","Chris McCarthy","Yes, we\u2019re very excited about Real World. We think that\u2019s another great added development for us. We\u2019re barely tapping into our IP. We have over 200 titles, and today, we\u2019re only utilizing about 10% of those. And that\u2019s against the growth that we have today, so we have 90% more to go. Real World is one of those IPs, and we really love the structure and the deal that we have there. It\u2019s the way that we manage our total ecosystem with each platform playing a different role.","So with respect to Facebook, the structure of the deal allows us to reach incremental audiences that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise be tapping into. And it\u2019s a content licensing structure, where we reinvent the model \u2013 the show, excuse me, specifically for them and integrate their community functionality, allowing us to create a new format with daily drops, as well as how to deepen engagement and really localize that, because we\u2019re launch it in three different markets. So we like that deal a lot, and you\u2019d hope to see \u2013 you\u2019ll see a lot more of those coming in the future.","Robert Bakish","But again,, I want to emphasize, this is exactly what the flagship brand is about. In February 17, we first introduced to the world the notion of a flagship brand, and I think people wondered what that really meant.","Fast forward to today at MTV, you\u2019re growing audience share on linear television, in fact, in two key demos, not just one. And in parallel to that, you\u2019re growing \u2013 we\u2019re growing consumption across an ecosystem. In digital, in live events, we\u2019re not creating product for third-party platforms. We don\u2019t have an O&O position, but we have a good licensing position. You add all that together and it\u2019s growing our top line, our OI and our diluted EPS.","And as Wade said, the in the case of MTV, it\u2019s already very material. So this is exactly what you need to do in the 21st century entertainment landscape. Our brands are uniquely equipped to do that, and you\u2019re already seeing it come to life.","Richard Greenfield","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. Just coming back to Pluto, can you guys give us a sense a little bit of the engagement on the platform today, sort of how much time the average viewer is spending on the service we can think about sort of the line of sight to those bigger ad ARPU numbers way that you threw out before?","And on monetization, you mentioned they sell out less than half of their inventory. I\u2019d imagine plugging that inventory into the Viacom ad sales force an ad tech platform could ramp that sell out pretty quickly. Maybe if you can just give us a sense for what your expectation is for timing on those \u2013 on bringing those assets together?","And then just more of a housekeeping question, Wade. Could you help us with the core domestic affiliate growth in the quarter? I don\u2019t think you gave that in your prepared remarks, I mean, what we might want to expect for the March quarter on that front?","Wade Davis","Sure. So with respect to Pluto, one of the really great things about Pluto, we talked about their overall domestic reach being 12 million users. Over 7.5 million of those users are on connected TVs, which is obviously where the most, not only the most valuable inventory reside because it really is TV \u2013 linear TV inventory and, in fact, advanced TV linear inventory, but that\u2019s also where you see the longest durations.","We did talk about some of the unique distribution components for Pluto, and in particular, the systems level integration with Samsung and Vizio, which are over 60% of the smart TV market in the U.S. Those platforms are actually pretty nascent. And so the consumption there is still evolving and it\u2019s relatively lower than some of the more established platforms kind of the big four Roku, Android, Amazon and iOS.","If you look at Roku and Amazon, it\u2019s in the high teens in terms of the number of hours per user per month. So, in particular, on the connected TV segment of the user base, it\u2019s very strong. And you\u2019re totally right that \u2013 this \u2013 when we talked about just how strong the strategic fit of this acquisition is with Viacom, Bob referenced utilization of library, how we can expand the partnership with our distributors.","But at the core, this is an ad-supported streaming service. We\u2019ve been investing since 2015 in driving the industry forward around targeted advanced TV ad campaigns. We launched the AMS business really formally last year. And we think it\u2019s going to be not far off of \u2013 it\u2019s going to be not far off of a $1 billion by the end of this year before you start adding Pluto in.","And so we do think that it\u2019s just \u2013 in a lot of ways, it\u2019s plug and play, both with respect to the volume and how we start driving fill rates and overall monetization of the unmonetized inventory that Pluto has. As it relates to deconstructing the in-quarter performance around affiliate, probably the most important thing to note is in the core linear affiliated business, where we saw contractual rate increases more than offset the linear sub decline, getting us to about 2% organic growth on the core linear business.","We did pick up a couple of points from growth in mobile and digital and syndication in the quarter. And I think that, it\u2019s important to note that those couple of points were even brought down by some of the negative SVOD liberty licensing comps in the quarter that were related to our strategic decision to bring our library back in-house.","Robert Bakish","And I want to give you one additional fact that we haven\u2019t talked a lot about is WHOSAY, and it goes to the value of integration with the Viacom family. If you talk to the leadership of WHOSAY and the sales force, what they\u2019ll tell you is their revenue since they\u2019ve been part of Viacom has ramped very significantly.","And the reason is, they\u2019re seeing money that they never saw before. And that is exactly what we\u2019re seeing coming together post close with Pluto and we think it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity. Again, we\u2019ve done it before. Now this will be that on a larger scale.","James Bombassei","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jessica-Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Jessica-Reif Ehrlich","Thanks. Maybe switching gears to the last one and a couple of follow-ups. But on this production, the ramp in Spanish language production, can you talk about how big that is? What\u2019s behind that? And is it a new team? And how big that can get?","And then just on the follow-ups, how much of your inventory is currently being used for Advanced Marketing Solutions? And where do you think that \u2013 what it could be? And on, I guess, the direct-to-consumer stuff, I just want to clarify something Bob said earlier on the call. The broadband-only service, I mean, the \u2013 when you provide Pluto to broadband-only subs for free, what\u2019s included in that? Are the Viacom cables and networks in there?","Robert Bakish","Sure. Thanks, Jessica. Let me start with the Spanish language point. And then I\u2019ll flip it to Wade for AMS, and then we\u2019ll finish on B2C. So, look, when we acquired, we\u2019ve long operated in Latin America and created dubbed versions of all our original Media Networks content, Nickelodeon, MTV, et cetera in addition to local original things like Acapulco Shore, et cetera.","The big game changer for us, however, was when we acquired Telefe. Telefe produces about 3,000 episodes of content a year out of Buenos Aires. And part of our strategy \u2013 and by the way, it\u2019s the number one broadcast network in Argentina, and its lead has increased to its large level in 10 years this quarter.","Our strategy was to use that as a production base. So in the current fiscal year \u2013 current year, Telefe is going to produce between 701,000 hours of original content for use beyond Argentina. We\u2019ve done that. This is largely in the drama space. It\u2019s very attractive economics. And you heard our America\u2019s team at NATPE last week talking about a string of deals with all sorts of folks, streamers, traditional players, et cetera.","So that is a very significant opportunity on a traditional basis. And that Spanish language portfolio of content, both from our traditional Media Networks brands, which isn\u2019t used at all in the U.S. today and from our Telefe production, which we now call Viacom International Studios, forms a very material content collection that we can deploy against the U.S. Hisppanic opportunity. We think it\u2019s very exciting, particularly since no one is doing this today in the streamer\u2019s space.","Wade Davis","With respect to the amount of AMS inventory that we\u2019re utilizing today, there\u2019s a couple of ways to think about it. The biggest category of AMS is advanced addressable inventory. The largest \u2013 the big components of that are, number one, our O&O digital video inventory, digital video inventory that exist on our partner MVPD apps.","And then in advanced addressable inventory that we have contractual entitlement to over the set-top box environment, both on the VOD and the kind of more recent partnerships that we\u2019ve built around our ability to insert addressable in the live linear with Charter, with Comcast, with Altice, et cetera.","And all of that inventory has both higher price and higher yield. There\u2019s a very small amount of linear inventory that we kind of reach into when we\u2019re trafficking our advantage campaign, but that\u2019s a very small piece. When you take all of that together in terms of AMS revenue pre-Pluto, we said this quarter is over 10% of our domestic ad revenue now. And as we move through the year, it\u2019s going to get closer to 15% to 20%.","Robert Bakish","And then lastly, to your question on Pluto and how it works with the pay-TV ecosystem. Look, as I said before, the video marketplace is segmenting by price point. Majority of homes here in the U.S. are still at this basic $80 price point. But we got tiers below it, whether that\u2019s vMVPDs at $45, all the way down to niche SVOD like Noggin, in single digits.","Ad-supported free is an important and underserved piece of the segmentation. It appeals to, among others, the value-conscious consumer. And in many respects, these broadband-only homes are kind of the new broadcast-only homes, and that is a fast-growing segment of the marketplace.","Importantly, we believe the majority of the Pluto TV audience is not watching pay-TV today. And so this segment already exists, so it makes sense for us, as Viacom, to take share. As we said, Pluto TV is already the leader in free streaming TV and given the segmenting of the market distributors need a free TV offering. As everyone knows, a pain point for distributors is how to add value to their customer base without adding cost to their P&L. Pluto TV does that.","In fact, it\u2019s an opportunity for Viacom to add incremental value across these guys\u2019 whole sub base, including as you said, broadband-only without adding any fixed cost for an operator. And it provides an opportunity for an incremental revenue stream in terms of the rev share and an opportunity to up-sell consumers inside their infrastructure to pay tiers and SVOD services or conversely to retain value from anyone that churns out of their sub base, and so still be able to participate in free economics.","We think adding this free product is a natural next step in the broadening of our already successful distribution strategy, which again encompasses basically linear licensing, on-demand product, advanced ad partnerships and co-productions and now has this free streaming piece.","I think, lastly, I\u2019d point out the idea already has traction. I\u2019ve spoken to leadership at every MVPD. They get it and there\u2019s real interest. And, in fact, Pluto TV already has a deal with a major MVPD for inclusion in their bundle and that\u2019ll be announced shortly.","Jessica-Reif Ehrlich","Great.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our September quarter\u2019s earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.","I want to refer you to Page number 2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. Let me start by highlighting what a different a year makes. Last year on the Q4 call, when I had just been announced as Acting CEO, Viacom reported meaningful declines across all key financial metrics.","This quarter\u2019s and this year's performance is dramatically stronger. Comparing year-over-year performance for 2017 versus 2016 on a like-for-like basis, excluding Telefe and foreign exchange consolidated revenues improved 5% versus a decline of 5%. Adjusted operating income was flat versus a decline of 30%, and operating free cash flow grew by more than $300 million versus a decline of over $1 billion in 2016.","Finally, as part of our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining investment grade metrics, since February, we paid down approximately $2 billion of debt, a reduction of 15%. This is an area we continue to be focused on and you will see further delevering over the course of 2018. Our momentum has been driven by the new strategy we introduced in February, a strategy we have spent the last nine months aggressively executing against.","Our momentum is also the product of the many organizational and operational changes we have made to support that strategy. And it's not just financial metrics that have improved, it\u2019s operating metrics as well. Throughout 2017, we set out to fundamentally stabilize and revitalize the business and that is exactly what we've done. First, you see it in the flagship brands, which we have prioritized and put on a path to broader exposure. It's a strategy that's working. We closed the quarter with U.S. ratings across the portfolio, up 3% and flagships up 6%.","This rating story extends internationally as well, where each and every one of our flagship brands as well as our general entertainment cornerstones Channel 5 and Telefe achieved growth in share for the first time ever. At the same time, we've made progress in broadening the expression of our brand, particularly with respect to features at Paramount, where we have a slate of branded films coming in 2019.","Second, you see it in the partnerships that we've strengthened. In distribution per our strategy, we have in fact grown our business beyond carriage to include data, advertising, and co-production. Our renewed agreements with Altice and more recently Charter demonstrate the value of this approach.","Here we accomplished what we intended. We secured broad distribution as part of multifaceted agreements at rates that are consistent with other large distributors and with attractive weight escalators going forward and we continue to be overwhelmingly carried on basic [tiers] [ph].","In the past year, deals representing nearly 50% of our subscriber base have been renewed or extended and we now have no significant renewals until well into 2019. To be clear, this was a significant accomplishment at a critical time for our business that removed the major area of uncertainty that hung over the business in 2017.","It's a key part of the stabilization story and I am very happy about it. I'm also excited to see that the gap in the market for a sports free, low cost entertainment bundle, the entertainment skinny pack that Viacom has been calling for is now starting to be filled. Just this week, we joined with Philo and a number of other entertainment content companies to announce a first-of-its kind U.S. product offered to consumers at $16 per month.","But it's not just distribution you also see the growing strength of our partnerships in the ad market too, where our strong relationships, industry-leading innovation, and growing ratings have improved [Indiscernible] ad sales revenue by eight percentage points from last year's minus eight to this quarter's flat, a dramatic improvement in performance.","Third, you see it across the talent and IP at our brand, whether that's the cross-house deal with Tyler Perry who's writing a film for BET as we speak or the joining of Jim Cameron and Paramount Pictures for the next new Terminator films, or the iconic band U2 rocking Trafalgar Square in London as part of the MTV EMA last weekend. There's a fresh energy and talent vitality across Viacom and that is critically important for a creative company like ours.","Four, you see it in our expanding digital and real world offerings. On the digital front we piloted a series of initiatives and are now about to accelerate our push into digital native content with the launch of Viacom Digital Studios under Kelly Day\u2019s leadership. Kelly formerly Chief Digital Officer of Awesomeness brings deep expertise to the table to help take our brands to a significantly higher level in the space, and what I call the real world, we have doubled attendance at Viacom event this year to over 2 million people and we have significant room to grow this, our Consumer Products business further, which I'll talk about in a moment.","Fifth, and finally, you see it in the energy in our buildings all around the world. Today we are more integrated, efficient and creative organization and I've been blown away by how this organization has embraced the new strategy and executed so quickly to drive our meaningful progress.","Taken together, these were all important steps forward for Viacom and more importantly, we now have a strong stable foundation from which to attack a changing media landscape. The stabilization effort did have some near-term cost. From a revenue standpoint, the combined effect of renewal driven rate reset with the industry-wide decline in pay-TV subs will contribute to some further softness in domestic affiliate revenues, particularly in the first half of 2018.","But as the year goes on, we will see the benefit of regaining distribution at Charter combined with easing of rate renewal comps, these efforts will allow Viacom to once again get the full benefit of its annual escalators and set the stage for return to affiliate growth in 2019. And it's off this now stable base we've established that we have turned our attention to the next phase of the journey, which is accelerating the transition to long-term sustainable growth in both revenue and OI.","But before I take you through that, let me turn it over to Wade, who will go over our quarterly and fiscal year results.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Bob. Good morning. We are pleased to report our financial results for the September quarter full-year fiscal 2017. The quarter and for the full-year, we saw revenue growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment as well as growth in operating free cash flow.","First, I will discuss the consolidated results for the year. Viacom generated revenue of $13.3 billion, 6% increase over the prior year and adjusted operating income $2.7 billion that was flat with last year. Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment grew revenues. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $3.77, an increase of 2% over the prior year and we've generated $1.5 billion of operating free cash flow, which is up 26% over last year, demonstrating the durability of our cash flows. This represents operating free cash flow per share of $3.77, which translates to an operating free cash flow yield of 15%.","Now moving to the results for the quarter. Viacom generated $3.3 billion of revenue and $578 million of adjusted operating income, up 3% and 7% respectively over the prior year. Both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment grew revenues. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year.","As we previously announced, Paramount has secured a series of individual financing agreement, which replaces our prior slate financing deal and better aligned with the studio's new slate strategy, consisting of a mix of big broad audience films and more targeted flagship branded films. More flexible and tailored financing model will allow us to capture greater upside and more modestly budgeted titles were presently there is no third-party financing.","Given the decision to end the slate financing deal with HuaHua and pursue alternative financing arrangement, we recorded a net $59 million negative impact on operating income in the quarter related to the write-off of amounts previously reported. Absent this impact, EPS would have been $0.88 in the quarter.","Turning to our segments. Slide 4 of our web deck provides the financial overview of our Media Networks segment. Revenues for the quarter increased by 3% to $2.6 billion, worldwide advertising revenues increased 6%, and ancillary revenues were up 5%, while affiliate revenues declined 1%. Adjusted operating income declined by 8% to $693 million.","Slide 5 of the web deck provides the breakdown of our Media Networks domestic and international revenue performance. Domestic revenues decreased 2% to $2 billion, while international revenues increased by 24% to $593 million. On organic basis, absent a four percentage point favorable foreign currency impact and 14 percentage point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenue would have grown 6% a quarter.","At our Media Networks business, domestic advertising in the quarter improved sequentially to flat year-over-year, which exceeded our prior guidance. This compares to a year-over-year decline of 2% in the June quarter. In the quarter, ratings growth was largely offset by an overall decline in cable subscribers and our strategic reduction in unit load to improve the viewer experience.","Domestic affiliate revenues decreased 3%. Decrease in the quarter was due to the lower revenues from SVOD and OTT agreement, decline in subscribers including continued flow through from Charter re-tiering and the transitional impact from rate resets associated with renewals.","These factors were partially offset by mid single-digit contractual rate increases. 12% decline in Media Networks domestic ancillary revenue to $76 million is principally due to lower consumer products revenues and lower revenues from our Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise ahead of its relaunch in 2018.","Now turning to international. Advertising revenues increased 36% in the quarter. Absent a 3 percentage point favorable impact from foreign currency and a 26 percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe, organic international advertising revenues would have been up 7%. The organic performance reflects strength in Europe.","International affiliate revenues increased 12% including a 4 percentage point favorable impact from foreign currency and a 2 percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe.","Growth in the quarter reflects the impact of new channel launches, rate increases, and subscriber growth. 21% increase in Media Networks international ancillary revenue to $105 million included a 7 percentage point favorable impact from foreign currency and a 7 percentage point benefit from Telefe. The organic growth benefited from our strategy to grow our off-network business driven by revenue from our recreational deals and higher consumer product license.","Worldwide expenses increased 7% in the quarter and included a 4 percentage point impact from the acquisition of Telefe. In operating expenses, programming expense increased 12% driven primarily by the timing of original programming premieres and the acquisition of Telefe, while distribution and another expense declined 2%. SG&A expense increased 3% in the quarter which included a 3 percentage point impact from Telefe.","Now turning to the studios results for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment revenues were up 2%, as increases in license fees and ancillary revenue were partially offset by decreases in Theatrical and Home Entertainment revenues. Slide 6 of the earnings presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.","Theatrical revenues decreased 43% to $115 million, principally reflecting lower revenue from our current quarter releases. Higher carryover revenues driven by Transformers, The Last Knight were more than offset by difficult comparison to the release of Star Trek Beyond in the September quarter of last year.","License fees increased 30% to $423 million driven by higher Paramount Television production revenue as well as higher revenues from pay-TV and SVOD. Paramount Television continued its significant growth more than tripling its revenues in the fiscal year through breakout releases, including Shooter, 13 Reasons Why and Berlin Station, all of which were renewed for a second season.","Ancillary revenues increased 33% to $61 million in the quarter. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $43 million in the quarter which included the $59 million negative impact related to our decision to end our prior slate financing arrangement. This compares to a loss of $137 million in the prior year, an improvement of $94 million. The improvement was driven by the increase in revenues and lower operating expenses.","In term of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate for the fiscal year was 30% as compared to 31.7% in the prior year. This was driven by the mix of domestic and international income. Components of free cash flow are broken out in Slide 11 of the earnings presentation. We generated $962 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter and 9% improvement versus the prior year.","For the fiscal year, we generated $1.5 billion of operating free cash flow which is up 26% year-over-year. The increase in full-year operating free cash flow was principally driven by improvements in working capital at Filmed Entertainment, including lower film spend, partially offset by higher cash taxes.","Turning to Slide 10. Since we announced our strategic plan on February 9 and our commitment to reducing leverage and maintaining investment-grade metrics, we have made meaningful progress, reducing gross debt by approximately $2 billion or 15%.","In terms of our debt, at quarter end, it was principally fixed rate with a weighted-average cost of 4.9%. We had $11.1 billion of total debt outstanding cash equivalents increased $1.4 billion. If you take into consideration, the equity credit we received on our hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter end was $10.5 billion.","I want to echo Bob's commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining investment grade metrics. Over the course of fiscal 2018, we will continue to pursue opportunities to delever. Looking ahead to fiscal 2018 transitional impacts from our renewed distributor relationships will continue to flow through our results, particularly in the first half of the year.","The near-term, we anticipate pressure on domestic affiliate revenues driven in large part by rate resets, lower SVOD revenues and the subscriber declines, which are amplified by a lag in the penetration improvement associated with our recent Charter renewal. Domestic affiliate revenues will show high single-digit declines in Q1 and Q2 with these declines improving in the second half, resulting in a mid single-digit decline for fiscal 2018.","Importantly, we expect that the momentum we gained in the back half of 2018 will set us up to return to domestic growth as we get into fiscal 2019, we benefit from regaining Charter distribution, flat renewal rate resets and fully benefit from contractual rate increases. This guidance reflects the transitional impact of our successful efforts to stabilize the distributor base and position us to drive new opportunities for future growth with our distributor. As of international affiliate revenues in fiscal 2018, we anticipate continued growth.","Turning to the ad sales, in the December quarter, we expect to see overall growth driven by continued strength of International, a low single-digit decline on the domestic side due to some ratings softness. We expect domestic performance to improve over the year with positive growth in the back half due to new original programming coming on air, as well as greater carriage benefits and contributions from digital initiatives.","Turning to Media Networks fiscal 2018 programming expenses, we expect the growth rate will be in the low to mid single-digits and continue to invest in our flagship networks, while benefiting from a shift in mix to non-scripted programming. Network from our programming expense, we see the opportunity to reinvent our cost structure to drive margin and profitability.","Based on the plan we have constructed, we project cost savings approximately $100 million in fiscal 2018, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of additional run rate savings, most of which will be realized by fiscal 2019 and will drop to the bottom line. Accordingly, fiscal 2018 Media Networks SG&A expense will improve by low single-digits driven by these cost initiatives.","Moving to the Studio, Paramount Pictures new management team has moved quickly to begin production on a 2019 slate and find cost efficiencies in production and marketing to enhance the bottom line. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate hundreds of millions of dollars operating income improvement.","Finally, for fiscal 2018, we forecast a book tax rate of approximately 31%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Thanks Wade. So no question, the industry is changing, but we see so much opportunity in all this change, because we know our audiences are consuming more content than ever before and that's why they're evolving our content, product line and business to enable Viacom's greater participation in that consumption.","And again now that we have a stable foundation, we have been ramping up our ability to do just that. If 2017 was about stabilization of Viacom, 2018 is all about acceleration, especially when it comes to important growth initiatives. We have a global content engine with diversity and depth of content across film, television and increasingly digital-native and real world experience.","We have global infrastructure for creation, packaging and monetization and we have seen piloted and gained experience with alternative models outside the U.S., all of which we are benefiting from as we leverage our base to accelerate growth across three broad opportunity areas.","First, accelerating the evolution of Viacom's media business to better serve next-generation platforms and solutions. Second, pushing the diversification of our business to grow our revenue footprint outside of media. And third and finally, growing share and margins both in our core domestic networks business as well as at Paramount film and television production to drive earnings growth and what continues to be a very large and profitable business.","Let\u2019s go through each of these. First, we are accelerating the evolution of Viacom's media business, ramping up our push into next-generation platforms and solutions. This is a multifaceted opportunity to expanding both B2B and B2C providing access to subscription, advertising, and production revenue stream on a global level.","Let's start with the enormous assets we have. We have a TV library with more than 10,000 unencumbered hours of content. We have an iconic film studio that not only produces premium content, but its home to a library with 100 years' worth of movies. And we are launching a digital studio that will produce short form content at scale. We are now focusing on how we can leverage, package and further monetize these incredible assets in innovative ways on multiple platforms.","Specific opportunity segments include OTT, licensing our products to third-party OTT distributors such as Sling and Sky Now and newer entrants like Philo as well as mobile platforms like Bima TV and dTV in Japan or Telkomsel in Indonesia. It also includes our own direct-to-consumer experiences, maximizing our free and authenticated apps, standalone subscription services such as Noggin and an international app version of BET and new experiences to come.","Finally, there are advanced advertising and brand solutions. These include our large and growing pool of addressable video inventory on our O&O platforms and the third-party inventory we have access to our distribution partnership. The good news is that these are not businesses we just have to create from scratch. In fact in fiscal 2017, the next-generation platform and solution business generated more than $350 million in revenue. The better news is that we can grow this substantially and that is what we are increasingly turning our efforts to.","Growth will be driven by new Viacom DTC products as well as the inclusion of our existing programming and additional OTT and mobile distribution platforms. In fact mobile with its billions of connected video enabled devices and increasingly commoditize and competitive structure as an enormous potential to drive growth. As an example of that potential, consider our recent experience in Japan where we created made for mobile versions of MTV that now have more viewers than MTV linear on pay-TV. And MTV linear ratings are at year-to-year high.","Through this end some initiatives we will take advantage of pilot work, we've been doing outside the U.S. over the past 24 months as well as those 10,000 hours of TV library content. Those will also be driven by the rapid expansion of Viacom\u2019s digital-native content including that created by Viacom Digital Studios as we ramp up this important content factor. And again, this is both a distribution and advertising revenue opportunity and it provides important promotional linkages to the other expressions of the flagship brand and it's global.","All told, these areas are targeted to grow more than 25% to approximately $450 million in 2018 with a plan to deliver more than $1 billion organically by 2020. Going forward, we will continue to update you on our progress in these areas given their increasing importance to our business.","Second, pushing our diversification into businesses with synergies to our traditional core. In February, we announced we would increase our focus on businesses that live off the screen and in the real world. This area leverages our global brands, IP, promotion, and operational infrastructure that strategically create revenue streams that are incremental to and independent from business.","Our global consumer products and live event businesses are the key elements of this area. In 2017, these build an $80 million of revenues and are currently expected to deliver approximately 25% growth to $350 million in 2018. And we have a plan in place to deliver between $500 million and $600 million of revenue by 2020.","Growth of the Consumer Products business will be driven by leveraging Viacom's full portfolio of IP, including that associated with both TV and Film in a more structured way. We will also benefit from the launch of new IP like Nick Jr., top-ranked as well the relaunch of existing IP like the new version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that is coming this year.","And increasingly, we will build partnerships with third-party IP owners to represent their Consumer Products business generating substantial economies of scale for both our partners and Viacom's benefit. It is through this combination of initiatives that Viacom can create a true scale position in the marketplace over the next few years.","Moving to our Live business. Growth will be driven by new licensed recreation and theme park properties, growth of existing events, and new events. This includes next month opening of the SpongeBob musical on Broadway here in New York. The opening of various licensed international destinations over the next few years, which are already in the pipeline, and the further growth and commercialization of existing events by Comedy Central Colossal Clusterfest and the BET experience. As with next generation platforms and solutions we look forward to sharing details on our Consumer Products and Live business over the coming quarters.","Third, and finally, we will create earnings growth both in our Core Domestic Networks business as well that Paramount Film and television production by growing share and margins. On the Domestic Networks side, we see a clear path to share growth through the flagship strategy we're already executing on and we see audience share improving as the quarter goes on where relative to last year, we've back loaded premier volume growth to better fit with pay viewing seasonality and the related audience opportunity. We're also looking for the launch of the Paramount Network on January 18, 2018 as a next the very exciting milestone.","In addition, as Wade mentioned we'll continue to improve our cost structure to grow our margins and drive profitability. We see considerable opportunity through changes related to procurement, real estate and automation as well as various other efficiencies the capture approximately 100 million in savings in fiscal 2018 and additional run rate savings in the hundreds of millions mostly realized by fiscal 2019 and all of these savings will boost income.","Beyond this let me remind you that our Network\u2019s business is global and that our International business has a very strong momentum having grown earnings strong double-digits in 2017. This is a business that has substantial growth ahead of it and one that includes 50% of an unconsolidated India business that is now doing more than $0.5 billion in revenue.","On the Paramount side, we see significant share and margin growth as this great content engine completes it's already underway turnaround and the new slate strategy a mix of big tentpole titles and smaller branded films comes to theaters in 2019. This combined with our growing slate of TV production, which tripled revenue in 2017 will drive material earnings growth at the studio.","It is important to note that Viacom\u2019s ownership of Paramount differentiates Viacom from many of its TV Network peers, particularly those focused on the pay TV space. We also believe both of these businesses International and Paramount, are real sources of unrecognized value, particularly in an evolving Media business. We couldn't be more excited about the year ahead and where we're going to take this business.","We have culturally and commercially powerful brands diversity and depth of content and the global infrastructure and expertise to accelerate growth across three areas of opportunity and create value for our shareholders. And underlying all of this work are Viacom's devoted audiences.","In a world of ever expanding consumer choice, passionate and loyal fans are more critical than ever. Viacom is the most watched cable family in the country and we rank number one among our young and diverse audiences for a reason. Our ability to create powerful, relevant content, sparks passion in our fans like no one else in our industry, and in an environment where direct relationship with your fans is fast becoming a competitive imperative, Viacom is one of the handful of media companies in the world that can persuasively make that claim.","Lastly and very importantly to me, as we look ahead, I am committed to further igniting the culture of creativity that makes Viacom great and which is essential to our success in the future. That means making the best content, any genre, any format, any length, or any platform.","Content we are proud to make and our audiences are proud to share. That means attracting the best talent in front of the camera, behind it and in every office and that means being seen as a creative problem solvers, a team that is continually pushing the envelope when it comes to products, packaging and promotion, helping to lead the industry evolution and working with our partners to do so. Finally, know we will execute and deliver in the months ahead with the same discipline and passion as we have in the last nine months.","Thank you. Now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Hi. Thanks guys. Maybe two for me, it's somewhat related. One is, given the visibility, you just sort of laid out on domestic affiliate growth from a pricing perspective and then the deals you've locked in. I guess and then layering in the sub losses, can you help us a little more in terms of the bridge on the assumptions there in terms of sub losses and the path of that growth in 2019?","And then I guess related for Wade possibly. Can you speak to the comments on margins and growth in the Media segment? Is the read-through here that you expect margin growth this year even with the pressure on domestic affiliate growth or is that more of a 2019 event?","Robert Bakish","Sure. Hey, John, how you\u2019re doing? I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll flip it to Wade as you suggested. So in 2017, we accomplished what we setout to do on the affiliate side, which was securing broad distribution as part of broadening partnerships and entering into the associate agreements. And we did that at rates in line with other large distributors and with attractive escalators going forward.","And as we said, in the past years, deals representing nearly 50% of our sub base have been either renewed or extended and a significant number of those were outside of cycle and so it's part of us proactively addressing the sub base. And again to be clear, this was a real accomplishment at a critical time for Viacom and it's a major part of the stabilization story and we do have no significant renewals now until well into 2019.","Now to your question, so September quarter financials reflect the combined impact of really three different elements and that is kind of runway to the business, the impact of renewals and then activity outside of that whether that\u2019s SVOD or the like. So when you look at the run way in the business, we see industry sub declines in line with what the industry [Indiscernible] have been talking about, this is the minus 3.5 that we have talked about before. You apply to that our annual escalators.","The second part \u2013 but there is one slight negative, which makes our number worse than minus 3.5 on a temporary basis, which is the impact of the Charter tiering. And that's a situation we have resolved, and that will roll off going forward, but that shows up both in the September \u2013 in the fourth quarter and it shows up in part of 2018.","Moving to the renewals, as we said, we entered into a number of new affiliate deals, which included rate resets. That is \u2013 actually will comp through as we go through 2018. And then there's the third part, which is the SVOD part, and as we stated that's a business we've moved away from as we prepared for our next leg of growth and that's a leg of growth that we talked some about that.","So when you put that all together, you see our 2018 affiliate business as down mid-single digits. It will be more than that in the beginning of year. It will improve in the second half of year as we comp through some of these things.","Wade Davis","And with respect to margins and growth for Media Networks, so as we said we're very focused on efficiency for the Media Networks business. Bob did highlight some of the headwinds we have in the first half of the year, but those headwinds are substantially unwinding in the second half of the year.","We do expect to see significant margin enhancement in the second half of the year. And as it relates to overall OI growth for the year that\u2019s largely going to be a function of the timing of some of the cost savings that we see come online, but you can expect it to be essentially flat or growing depending on the timing of that. But definitively the overall company will grow operating income...","Robert Bakish","And I also want to emphasis on the affiliate side and as we transition through 2018, we will see a return to growth in 2019.","John Janedis","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thanks. Maybe just picking up on actually both those topics. Bob, I think the market, if you look at your stock price, obviously had some questions about your ability to drive affiliate revenues over time. And there's concern that every renewal that you have will lead to a reset. So when you look at what happened this year, the conversations you're having with distributors and the fact that you\u2019ve actively renewed with some. Can you contrast this process with what you expect the process to be in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 and beyond as you go through what will hopefully be a more normalized renewal process? ","And then Wade just wondering if you could help us \u2013 you talked a lot about growing company OI in 2018, which is good to hear. Could you help us on free cash flow and what you expect for free cash flow versus 2017?","Robert Bakish","Yes. So I'd say the difference now versus the future is really threefold. One is we have to address some friction in our relationships that have been built up over time, and so we spend a lot of time with affiliates. And as part of that going to the second part, we brought to the table a broader value equation, which includes not only licensing affiliate feeds, but also participating in adding value in the ad space and in the case of charter doing some co-production.","Now we did all that in a time where we're still revitalizing our product on the flagship side. And we did all that including with charter with a place where we did have a significant gap in rate given their current size. So as I look forward the two things that changed are, one is the products getting a lot stronger and we're able to leverage this proven at that time a broader relationship. So no, I anticipate that this is part of the stabilization process and as we move forward we leave that in our [tail lights] [ph].","Wade Davis","And as it relates to free cash flow, we had a very good year from a cash tax standpoint in 2017. So whether or not we will grow free cash flow in the aggregate, is going to be a function of cash taxes which obviously for everybody is a little bit up in the air in terms of tax reform and for us is going to be a function of domestic and international mix.","But fundamentally the operating part of our business, Media Networks, corporate Filmed Entertainments, we will grow cash flow out of those areas. So whether or not overall free cash flow growth for the company is going to be a function of cash taxes but it will grow out of the operating elements of the business.","Benjamin Swinburne","That's very helpful. Maybe just one follow-up, Bob on the advertising side, which was a nice surprise this quarter, as you pick up Suddenlink distribution and the re-tiering at Charter unwinds, is that a material tailwind to the ad business given you're going to pick up a lot more potential viewers?","Robert Bakish","It\u2019s definitely a tailwind that will roll in as we get into 2018.","Benjamin Swinburne","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jessica Reif with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thanks. I have two different topics. First, in light of the potential Fox, Disney transaction on AT&T, Time Warner just in light of some of the reshaping of the media industry. Can you give us your thoughts on where Paramount sits given its size? You said its core to the business and it differentiates you, but would you consider getting bigger and if so could you talk about potential structures you would consider?","And the second topic is on the newer cable deals, it seems like there's two pieces, advertising piece and a content piece. Can you give us a little bit more color on each of those and it sounds like you're getting not just more data analytics, but maybe more inventory, and then on the other side you've decreased inventory load. Can you just give us color across that whole piece? Thank you.","Robert Bakish","Yes. Sure, Jessica. Let me take the Paramount piece and then I\u2019ll let Wade fill in some of the details. So on Paramount, as you stated, we view it as an integral part of the company, it's part of our flagship brand strategy, we're thrilled with the new team we have in place, we have an industry leading team there, and we're very excited about what's in the pipeline for 2019 and by the way that's not just the film side that the television side as well, which as we remark tripled revenue in 2017.","We are highly confident in our ability to drive organic growth there as that great content engine really comes back to the fore. And so that\u2019s the business we think is great as it is and we look very much forward to. So we don't believe to answer your question we need to combine it with another film studio. Wade?","Wade Davis","Sure. So first I'd like say with respect to our strategy in changing the nature of our affiliate relationship, so we did announce in February that we\u2019re focused on really reinventing the nature of these relationships to become much more multifaceted and allow us to strengthen the overall value proposition of the pay-TV echo system with our distribution partners.","And so you saw that in our \u2013 you\u2019ll see it again in Charter where in addition to the core content licensing. We've also introduced content co-production as well as an innovative approach to advertising an advanced data that allows both of us to grow our revenues associated in these two areas.","As it relates to the co-production part, this is a great place where in the Charter, example we're creating value for both companies. Charter gets the first window for the exclusive content in their footprint and then we get a second window of exclusive airing nationally. And this is also going to be produced by Paramount, it\u2019s going to grow revenue for Paramount TV, it\u2019s going to grow library value for Paramount and continue to fuel this important area of growth for us.","As it relates to ad sales, it\u2019s a separate agreement between us and Charter outside of affiliate agreement to collaborate on advance data and advertising opportunities that are going to accelerate the penetration of dynamic ad insertion into the TV infrastructure. This creates new valuable and probably most important differentiated pools of inventory for both Charter and Viacom similar to Altice. And as far as we know we're the only company in the space that's kind of leading this transformation of the nature of these relationships to include these multiple facets.","Jessica Reif Cohen","And then what about the advertising decrease? How much did you decrease your load?","Wade Davis","Over the course of 2017 we decreased the load about 7%. It\u2019s among the factors that Bob indicated that are going to fuel the growth in domestic ad sales over the course of 2018 will be lapping that in addition to the other factors that Bob indicated.","Robert Bakish","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Rich Greenfield with BTIG Capital Markets.","Mark Kelley","Hi, guys. This is Mark Kelley on for Rich. Thanks for taking the question. When you say growth in 2019 affiliates, is that assuming a 3.5% loss of subs because the industry as a whole not just Viacom is underestimated the rate of cord cutting and shaving? So what gives you comfort in that runway for 2019? Thanks.","Robert Bakish","So as I mentioned there's three components of the affiliate equation. There is the run rate which is where your 3.5% would fall in. There's the renewals which wouldn't apply to this answer and then there's the other business which you think of us as SVOD. So where we see growth is really in the first component and the third component and we don't see a significant renewal activity in 2019.","Important to note that \u2013 you're right, I mean we have the 3.5% that's a plus or minus, we'll see that whether it plays out, but we do anticipate continued activity in the VMVPD space and importantly in the mobile space. So when you think about mobile as I mentioned in my remarks, you have at least in the case of U.S. hundreds of millions of subscribers, obviously billions worldwide and look at what's going on in mobile now.","We've been piloting video distribution on mobile outside the U.S., we begin to see some of that activity in the U.S. And by the time we get into 2019, we believe that will be a factor and that will be a strong positive.","Mark Kelley","Thank you.","End of Q&A","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the SVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our March quarter earnings call.","Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.","I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now, I will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Good morning and thanks so much for joining us today. I'm pleased to update you on our progress at this important stage in Viacom's turnaround. As we pivot from stabilization and revitalization to growth. In particular, you will see we are exiting the first half of our fiscal year with real momentum and are excited about our return to growth as we head into the second half of the year.","Let's start with the headlines for the quarter. Financially, we met or beat guidance on all key metrics. This includes sequential improvement in domestic ad and domestic affiliate revenues. Double-digit increases across all international media networks revenue stream and a strong double-digit increase on operating income and finally a return to profitability at Paramount.","All of this translates into consolidated adjusted operating income growth of 5% and 16% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter. Strategically, we delivered strong execution on our plan with importantly wins across our three priorities, which are first growing share and margins in our core business, second, accelerating our transition to next generation platforms and solution and third diversifying into adjacent businesses.","And we are excited about the future including the fact that we are reaffirming adjusted OI growth in the second half of the year and with Q2s over performance we now expect upside to the full-year with adjusted OI growth in the low single-digits. There is a lot to talk about.","Let me take you through each piece starting with progress in our core business. First, filmed entertainment. As I mentioned, Q2 marks Paramount's return to profitability with the studio's operating results growing $75 million in the quarter versus the prior year.","This is an important step towards delivering on our expected meaningful improvement in adjusted operating income for the full-year, and in fact, we have been more optimistic about the back half performance than on our last call.","Most importantly it's clear that Paramount's turnaround is really taking hold. The latest evidence of the turnaround is the breakouts hit A Quiet Place, which has the third quarter off to a very strong start. This is the first film produced and released under the studio\u2019s new management team and it is driven by great talent both in front of the camera and behind it.","The quality of the film combined with the team\u2019s production cost discipline and smart marketing execution or a pace of the coming slate and Paramount's potential going forward. And what a result. A Quiet Place was Paramount's biggest opening since 2016 and the second biggest domestic opening of any film in 2018.","Three weeks in the film has brought in more than $131 million domestically and $75 million internationally and many major markets are still to come including China. We are securing distribution for our horror film is a rare occurrence in an achievement in itself. Even this movie was made for just $20 million it's a monster hit by every measure.","Looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming slate, including the first BET co-branded film with Tyler Perry coming in November, I'm also excited to say that we are moving forward with Paramount players feature film adaptation of Trevor Noah\u2019s bestselling memoir Born a Crime stories from a South African childhood. As part of a broader cost company partnership, we recently announced the Trevor and his production, so we are not only delivering a strong and revitalized Paramount, but one that is an integral part of my Viacom with roughly half of the 2019 slate being comprised of branded films.","Additionally, we continue to see momentum on the Paramount Television Production side with 17 series now ordered or in production and 19 additional series set up at networks. We love the trajectory of this business and anticipate Paramount TV of which 400 million in revenues for fiscal 2018, put it altogether and it's clear that great things are happening at Paramount and the team is just getting going.","Next, Domestic Media Networks. Here the story is building to despite headwinds from the Olympics in February, the second quarter represented the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year view and share growth at our flagships and there was notable strength across the portfolio, including at BET which marks its third consecutive quarter of double-digit ratings growth as well as MTV, Comedy Central, TV Land and CMT.","And relative to the rest of the industry consider this fact in the second quarter only four basic cable networks in the top 20 grew rating and Viacom had three of them. With MTV, Comedy Central and VH1. This is based on total day ratings against the clinical 18 to 49 demographic.","I\u2019m also happy to report we are seeing a strong start to the third quarter including at MTV, where the turnaround is unquestionably taking hold. The network just had the biggest unscripted premier on all of cable since 2012 with 10 million viewers tuning into the New Jersey Shore Family Vacation series over the first weekend. And it\u2019s also worth noting that the show beats every other network including broadcasters during its debut.","Moving to International Media Networks, women continues to be a growth engine with double-digit increases in Q2 across all revenue streams including ad and affiliate, as well as very strong double-digit growth and profitability and it\u2019s on pace for another record year. On an operating basis, we saw cumulative household subscriber growth in every major geography.","Thanks to channel launches in markets like the UK and Poland and other distribution gains across the portfolio. Given that international Pay-TV penetration is approximately 40% as compared to 80% in U.S. we believe there is much more growth to come.","Lastly in our core business cost transformation efforts continue and we are on track to deliver in excess of $100 million of savings in this year and more than $300 million in run rate savings in 2019 and beyond.","Over the past year and a half this management team has made cost transformation a priority. The combination of the actions we took in 2017 whilst the current cost transformation activities underway we will deliver approximately $500 million of run rate savings. While the savings from actions in 2017 were reinvested in the business to drive growth, the savings realized from our 2018 actions will drop to the bottom line.","So, the cost transformation opportunity is important and material, and that is why we have now deployed dedicated personnel across multiple functions, including strategy, finance, technology, and sourcing, among others to ensure we are truly transforming the cost base of our entire business.","Very importantly to us a significant majority of these savings are not headcount reductions. Instead, most are driven by a continuation of our efforts to these [defile] (Ph) the company and act as one Viacom, consolidating real estate within given markets, standardizing policies and procedures, benefiting from our purchasing scale, and more.","As we work to position Viacom for the future, we also continue taking big steps against our second strategic priority, accelerating our transition to next generation platforms and solutions. Let's start with the important strides made in mobile; in Q2 we closed the mobile deal for Paramount Plus with Telenor in the Nordics and we have just announced an extension of our dealer Telkomsel to offer to Nick Junior channel to their mobile subscribers in Indonesia.","We also relaunched Nickelodeon Japan as an OTT only service after nearly a decade off the air. And we expect to announce two more mobile deals in major European markets shortly. These deals are important, because when combined with last quarter's Telef\u00f3nica deal, they mean that TV distribution on mobile catalyst is now beginning to materialize in Europe, Latin America and Asia. And we continue to push for progress in this category domestically too where we are in active discussions with our number of large carriers.","Turning to direct-to-consumer. We are on track to launch a significant differentiated B2C platform later this year, we have also secured distribution of the modern app on Amazon Prime video channels expanding consumer access to Nickelodeon\u2019s pre-school programming. Related to this, we also have Channel Fives Milkshake app launching on the Amazon channel store in the UK.","And while only launched last year late last year Viacom Digital Studios or VDS is already making significant progress in capitalizing on our digital presence. We have 850 million social followers across the portfolio and in the quarter reached 4.3 billion social video views and 4.7 billion minutes used domestically growth of 70% and 78% respectively year-on-year which is ahead of our expectation.","To support and further grow this demand, we will continue to be very aggressive in increasing the volume of digital output and will publish more than 600 hours of original content this year. And remember, this was short form so we are talking about an incredible volume of fresh episodes.","VDS Production will support a range of Viacom offering, including on social, upcoming mobile product and our B2C offering. All of this is just the tip of iceberg in fact next Monday we will be hosting our first New Front event in New York, which will serve a coming-app party to VDS and highlight just how much and how quickly the digital game has changed at Viacom.","As we head very quickly into the upfront season, I want to comment on how the market is shaping up. As everyone knows, the aggregate industry ratings picture across broadcast and cable is negative which means supply will be tight very tight, that combined with the fact we are seeing extremely strong scatter pricing, suggest the upfront will be strong particularly as remained with the pricing.","And more broadly the overall tone of the market is looking good. So we very much like how this is setting up and for us, one of the big elements of the upfront is going to be our Advanced Marketing Solution AMS, an increasingly import and differentiated offering for Viacom.","AMS is critical to our future, because it provides incremental supply in the form of both units and branded content and enhanced features and [targetability] (Ph) which in turn drive much more effective price and yields.","We have been working aggressively to strengthen our offerings through our acquisitions of Whosay and VidCon and very importantly the innovative Advanced Advertising and data the yields we have executed with MVPDs over the last year, including the one we announced with Comcast on Monday.","Dave will take you through the detail on AMS shortly so you can more fully understand the powerful growth driving assets we bring to the table and as he does note that the growth is largely independent of linear television viewership, which brings into our third strategic priority.","Our move to diversify beyond our core business, including live events, recreation and consumer product. Not only do these businesses reinforce the brand from a consumer standpoint and create new revenue opportunities, but they also give us unique offerings to advertisers and distribution partners one that stands for Media Networks and Film.","That's why we continue to increase the number of events and associated foot traffic. In the second quarter attendees at our global events, doubled over the same quarter of last year and there is a lot more to come. This quarter alone, we have the return of Comedy Central's Clusterfest and the BET experience plus we are adding Nick\u2019s first SlimeFest in the U.S. at our first ever VidCon this is an exciting area and we expect revenue in live events and recreation to nearly double in 2018.","Lastly, I want to talk to you about a new growth project we have been working on to quickly capitalize on the infrastructure and expertise we already have in-house. The launch of across Viacom Studio Production business to create premium episodic content that operates under the flagship brands but lives on third-party platforms.","Building on the success of Paramount Television, and Tele phase quickly growing production business we are going to much more aggressively tap into the huge demand for content and unlock more of our IP and production and creative capabilities to drive incremental revenues from third-party platform.","It isn't just an idea, given our leading positions in key genres we are already mining our libraries of IP to create long form episodic content that might not fit our liner brands today, but could work for others. For example, there is a lot of interest from SVOD partners in licensing, library properties from MTV and Nickelodeon IP for brand new interpretation. At the same time, we are also developing new IP for the sector and have already closed deals for brand-new original Nick IP in animation with third-party and we see more in the pipeline.","Now, I will hand it to Wade to talk you through the numbers and drivers of growth going forward.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Bob and good morning. The March quarter of fiscal 2018 was a great quarter for us and I\u2019m looking forward to talking to you about some of the key drivers and how this sets us up for growth in the second half of this year and beyond.","Before I speak to our adjusted results. I want to note that we recorded a $185 million pre-tax charge related to our cost transformation initiative this quarter. Additionally, as we continue to execute against these initiatives, we expect to take charges totaling approximately $40 million in the second half of fiscal year, principally related to third-party professional fees.","Now moving to the segment results, I will start with Paramount, which is on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation. As Bob mentioned the studio delivered a strong quarter and generated a $75 million improvement in adjusted operating income. This improvement in profitability was driven by lower distribution and marketing expenses associated with fewer theatrical releases which in part reflected the modification of the release strategy on certain films.","Lower overall film entertainment revenues also reflected the smaller number of theatrical releases as well as lower carryover performance from the legacy slate. I want to note that the modification of the release strategy on certain films shifted revenue from theatrical into licensing revenues. For the full-year Paramount is on track to deliver meaningful improvement in adjusted operating income and we now see upside to our previous guidance.","Looking at the first half of 2018, filmed entertainment profitability has already improved $125 million versus the prior year. In addition to improving the product on the screen and refining the release approach to selected films such as Annihilation and Cloverfield.","An important element of overall profitability improvement has been the team's ability to more effectively monetize the film library, where the profit contribution this year will be up 45% as compared to fiscal year 2016. The improvement in profitability versus last year will continue through the back half of 2018 and we expect Paramount to return to meaningful full-year profitability in fiscal 2019.","Now turning to media networks, which is Slide 11 of our earnings presentation. Worldwide media networks revenue for the quarter were up 1% to $2.4 billion, driven by 18% growth in international and partially offset by modest domestic declines.","Adjusted operating income declined 5% the increases in revenue was offset by investments in original programming higher participation expense and costs related our growth initiative. Worldwide ancillary revenues were up 30% or worldwide advertising and affiliate revenues were flat in the quarter.","Domestic advertising revenues declined 3% which was a sequential improvement from the first quarter and in-line with our guidance. The performance in the quarter reflects lower linear impression partially offset by higher pricing and strong revenue growth and Advance Marketing Solutions.","Given the importance of our Advanced Marketing Solutions portfolio as an engine of growth for our domestic ad or sales business I want to take a moment to build on what Bob discussed and we are clear about what activities are in this area, why we are so proud of what we have built and why we are excited about the prospects for growth.","Our AMS portfolio consists of two broad categories advanced addressable video inventory and brand solution. Advance addressable video inventory is made up of pools of inventory that we are aggregating and enabling to allow dynamic ad insertion and advanced targeting to fulfill the demand for next generation video ad products.","This is important because it allows us to transition the fulfillment advantage linear campaigns from the static linear infrastructure through a more efficient addressable infrastructure or high level, this inventory resides in two buckets OTT and advance set-top box inventory. The OTT inventory consist of our owned and operated apps, virtual MVPD apps, as well as MVPD companion apps.","The advance set-top box inventory consists of addressable units traffic through the set-top box infrastructure against DoD and importantly, our emerging ability to serve addressable ads in the live linear. For live linear insertion, we have made significant progress technically and operationally, enabling parts of our piece, Comcast and Charters footprint and expect to accelerate our monetization of this inventory towards the end of the fiscal year, which is one of the factors contributing to our confidence in turning to domestic advertising growth in the fourth quarter.","Second category of the AMS portfolio is brand solutions. These solutions generally consists of a bundle of consulting, creative services and associated media acquisitions. The four principle offerings include social campaigns that are sold and delivered under our Whosay brand, creative and marketing integrations delivered by Viacom Velocity.","Experiential solutions that are activated within our rapidly of live event and shopper marketing which extends our region to physical stores and provides access to trade promotion budgets, which is an industry in the 10s of billions of dollars that we have never participated in.","We are entering this market by leveraging our retail relationships is one of the larger CP licenses in the world and by capitalizing on our position as an advertising partner with the world's leading consumer packaged goods company.","In the aggregate revenues from our AMS portfolio grew 29% this quarter, and we expect them to accelerate in the back half of the years we bring new pools of inventory online and expand our capacity to deliver overall brand solutions. For the full-year, we anticipate AMS revenues will approach $300 million.","Additionally in the back half of the year domestic linear ad sales would benefit from increased capacity associated with the reinstatement on Charters basics here. Due to the principal factors they give us confidence and the continued sequential improvement or domestic ad sales in the back half of the year and the return to growth in the fourth quarter.","Moving to domestic affiliate revenue, 4% year-over-year decrease in revenue was in-line with our guidance and a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The performance in the quarter reflects subscriber declines, partially offset by contractual rate increases. The benefit of the current quarter contractual rate increases would temporarily reduced by rate resets in recent renewals.","This dynamic will unwind in the coming quarters as we lap these rate resets and we will begin to see the full benefits of the mid single-digit escalators that we have across our portfolio. As we look to the rest of the year we are on track with our full-year guidance of a decline at the low-end of the mid single-digit range for domestic affiliate revenues.","There are a number of drivers to give us confidence and improvement in the back half of the year. First, virtual MVPD growth is accelerating. We expect revenue from virtual MVPDs in the second half of 2018 to be 2.5 times what they were in the back half of last year.","Second, our reinstated carriage and charter in Suddenlink is expected to add up to 2 million more subs in the back half of the year. And lastly we will begin to lap the rate resets that I mentioned a moment ago. Looking to fiscal 2019, we continue to expect return to growth in domestic affiliate revenues.","Now turning to international media and networks and Slide 12. Strong momentum continued with 18% growth in revenue driven by the double-digit growth in all revenue streams as well as strong double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. International affiliate revenues increased 23% driven by higher SVOD and other OTT revenues as well as 9% points favorable impact from foreign currency.","International advertising revenues increased 11% largely driven by a 10 percentage points favorable impact from FX. Organic ad sales were impacted a fewer commercial impressions in the UK and a difficult prior year way to comparison in Argentina. Worth noting however that in the June quarter we are seeing strong pre-World Cup spending in LatAm as well as increased share viewing associated impression in the UK.","For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect low to mid-teens growth in internal advertising revenues and low double-digits growth in international affiliate revenues. Finally, we continue to make progress diversifying our business into adjacent revenue streams which is the third pillar in our growth strategy.","This is reflected in our worldwide ancillary revenues which were up 30% in the quarter with domestic revenues up 26% and international revenues up 36% including a 12 percentage points favorable FX impact. Absent the FX impact the growth in worldwide ancillary revenues was driven by growth in consumer products, recreations and live events revenues.","Looking ahead, we expect continued strong growth form our adjacent businesses. Recreation and live events which span both our media and networks and some of the entertainment division are expected to nearly double in fiscal 2018 and continued grow strong double-digits in 2019 driven by a growth in the number of live events as well as attendance.","Strong growth in recreation is driven by an increase in the number of site activations and design for upcoming sites. We also expect our worldwide consumer product business to grow revenue in the low to mid-single digit range as new partnerships and IP come online.","I will wrap up the media and network segment by touching on expenses. We continue to invest in our content and growth initiatives while transforming our non programming cost base to drive efficiencies in SG&A. In the march quarter programming expense increased to 5% reflecting investments in original programming.","Distribution and other expenses grew 30% driven by increased participation expense and cost related to our growth initiatives. Despite an increase in marketing expense to support our new programming, SG&A expenses was essentially flat in the quarter and included a five percentage point benefit related to savings from our cost transformation.","For the full-year, we continue to expect programming expense to grow in low single-digits as we invest in our flagship networks while benefitting from a mix shift to non-scripted programming and leveraging content globally.","In terms of seasonality in the back half of the year growth in programming and associated marketing expenses will be weighted for the June quarter reflecting the timing of original content launches. We continue to expect distribution and other expenses to grow double-digits for the full-year driven by investments in our growth initiative.","Now moving below the line, in terms of taxes the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, as we benefitted from the new tax legislation. For the full-year we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 25% which compares to 30% last year. We will continue refine this as go through the year and we get a better sense of domestic versus international profitability mix.","The components of free cash flow are broken out on Slide 14 of the earnings presentation. Year-to-date, we generated operating free cash flow of $235 million which compares to $343 million last year. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally driven by higher working capital utilization due to the ramp-up in film and television production, partially offset by the benefit from lower cash taxes related to Tax Reform.","At quarter end we had $10.1 billion of total debt outstanding and cash of $417 million. Our debt was principally fixed rate with a weighted average cost of approximately 5%. If you take into consideration the equity credit we received from S&P and Fitch on our hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter end was $9.4 billion. We plan to continue to pursue opportunities to delever over the course of fiscal 2018, including using our excess free cash flow to redeem debt.","With that, I would like to turn it back over to Bob to wrap up.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Wade. In closing, we are so pleased with the progress we have continued to make and the momentum we have heading into the next phase of Viacom growth. We have taken many important steps to ensure we get the most out of our large and revitalized core business, including continually improving how efficiently we operate and organize our business.","As we look ahead, the upside of Paramount continued strength as international and the going forward delivery of our strategic growth initiatives especially Advanced Marketing Solutions and next generation distribution will help to power our growth in the second half of the year and beyond.","We couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunities in front of us and our ability to very quickly capture them and deliver results. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your continued support.","I will now turn it back to Jim.","James Bombassei","Before we open up the line I want to note that will not be responding to any questions or comment about the process of CBS. The purpose of today's call is to discuss our second quarter results and performance. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Hi thank you. Bob maybe two for you. First, heading into the upfront and now that you are further along in the flagship strategy and with ratings improving along with AMS. Can you talk about early discussions in terms of appetite for marketers, are you seeing any incremental interest form new advertisers and with some of the tour industry headlines do have an early view on the kids upfront and then separately, I'm not sure I fully heard this correctly, but I know you talked about an interest from SSI partners to license product, can you talk about the balance, between license and some of the IP which to pull audience out of flagship relative to the revenue opportunity, is that more an international opportunity for you.","Robert Bakish","Sure, thanks John. Look, I mean upfront as I said in general it's selling up very well for networks and for Viacom in particular, supply is clearly tight and pricing going is proving to be very strong, I mean we are seeing 30% really plus scatter versus upfront pricing and we are seeing double-digits scatter-to-scatter in Q2. That\u2019s really strong.","There is a lot of conversation also around the quality of the environment and credibility of delivery both of which are strengths for Viacom. I think it's also worth noting, we have been having a series of meeting over the last couple weeks with agency holding companies and in those meetings there is a clear appreciation of the progress Viacom has made, including as you know John with the flagships.","And equally important the slates that we are bringing to the table for the next broadcast year plus our industry leading Advanced Marketing Solutions both in the data-driven and branded content form. So the quality of the conversation there is fantastic. So given all that we are feeling very good about the upfront, know that we will definitely be focused on price quote and where necessary we are willing to bet on scattered because again there is just not that much inventory to go around.","To your second part of your question. The kids upfront, let me add a couple of points there, the notion of tight supply and that help in pricing is certainly the case in kids as well, that will be particularly true with what we call hard ace that's the pre-Christmas series of weeks where demand is strong if an when there is a lot of revenue.","And I think unlike last year on the film category is looking very strong. If you recall from last year's kids upfront, if you tracked it, the film category was down and that was the real headwind for the upfront. This year and we have been out to all the studios in the last couple of weeks, there are more releases coming and probably equally importantly or at least in addition to that DreamWorks animation is back as a buyer they sat out last year.","And as you know, the studios have among the highest pricing, so an increase in this category is very important and bodes very well for the upfront. Worth noting that consistent with our overall strategy we will be selling a broader mixed ecosystem in this upfront including digital and events that helps accommodate involving advertiser mixes and helps bring more money into the house.","As an example to that SlimeFest will be sold out this year, a lot of interest there, our social products, Whosay is proving very interesting for kids advertisers looking for effective and quick creative solutions. So we are feeling very good about the upfront both in general and with respect to kids.","Your last question on SVOD, the comment is look core Viacom is a content company. We have tremendous capabilities associated with content creation and there is an incremental marketplace that we can serve not only with Paramount Television which is already serving that market, but also with under the flagship brand whether that\u2019s Nickelodeon or MTV, et cetera.","And we see that as an incremental opportunity, that\u2019s licensing new IP either spin offs from the library or new IP at a whole cost, this is probably IP that we look at, it doesn't fit perfectly with our linear strategy today, but is attractive against a third-party platform.","So we believe that\u2019s fundamentally an incremental opportunity, and again as I said, it\u2019s not an idea, we already have some deals in place that we will announce shortly and we think it's another leg of the Viacom growth story.","John Janedis","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi thank you. My question is on Paramount and the normal success you have had with the Quiet Place at the box office, anything you could kind of elaborate on in terms of things management team did differently with this project, was it the marketing or any other part of the release that contributed to success and any kind of read through on that success we can sort of take for Paramount\u2019s outlook?","Robert Bakish","Sure Alexia. Look the headline of this is this is the first film that was both produced and released under the new management team. And so as a remark that has showed off in terms of the quality of the exact film, the cost discipline, the way it was marketed. And again, Quiet Place is a huge hit, second biggest opening of any film in 2018, which means that although it was essentially or thought of as a horror film, it\u2019s gone wider than that, and that speak to both the quality of the film yet but also in how it was marketing.","And so you are seeing the team showed through in many dimensions here and it\u2019s what we believe we were putting together, but now you are actually seeing it happen and we are thrilled and as we look forward we are very excited about the slate ahead. The new team has ready green lit and dated 12 films from 2019, we will likely get to 16, we are excited about the diversity and balance of the upcoming slate.","When I talked to Jim even before he joined the company and he looked at the time our 2017 slate, he was troubled by construction, this slate that we have for 2019 a great balance to 10 fold, almost half of the films are modestly priced with budgets of $25 million or less, and of course as I have said, the four branded films play a prominent part in the slate as well.","So we are excited about the capabilities of this team, also their relationships in the creative community, so that in terms of sourcing product, it\u2019s something that keeps coming back to me at highest levels of the agencies, so it\u2019s really a testament to the quality of the team and at the end of the team great management matters and we have great management at Paramount.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you and just a quick follow-up if I can on the media and network side, I think Wade you talked or gave a lot of detail about the AMS and the improvements on the key flagship networks and the rating. I guess is it possible when you look at that guidance that you reiterated to put the advertising domestic advertising turning positive by year-end, is that in still process of the team given all these positive if Nickelodeon\u2019s rating still remain weak or do you need to - are you looking for turnaround there as well.","Wade Davis","Yes, where we remain confident in the guidance that we have given with respect to domestic ad sales of sequential improvement in the back half of the year and returning the growth in the fourth quarter. And the drivers of that and our confidence are really driven by the continued momentum in AMS, we expect AMS to accelerate from where it was in the second quarter where we grew just under 30%, we expect AMS to sequentially double going from Q2 to Q3.","We also see pretty strong acceleration of virtual MVPD growth which contributes to the inventory that\u2019s in AMS, the lapping of rate resets that we had in the June quarter of last year and then we are also benefiting from the reinstated carriage on charter and Suddenlink where we think in the back half of the year we are going to get up to about two million additional subs.","So we have great line of sight into the underlying factors that are going to drive improvement in - the sequential improvement in domestic ad sales and gets us back to growth by the fourth quarter.","Robert Bakish","And let me just tackle on to that a specific Nickelodeon comment, let's not forget Nickelodeon remains the clear number one kids television network. Even with the current rating challenges Nick\u2019s competitive position is very strong, it own a biggest share of total viewing at 43% and has 67% of all ads for viewing in the kids TV space and as a clear number one we are 64% ahead of Disney and a 125% ahead of cartoon and what does that do for us, being number one gives you over index from an ad sales perspective and all by the way your magnet for the creative community and your great launching pad the new IP. So as we combine that highly differentiated number one position with tight supply and what is going to happen in pricing, we feel very good about the prospects for Nick.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with Moffett Nathanson.","Michael Nathanson","Thank you, I have two for Bob. Bob I think for us a big surprise this quarter was international affiliate fee number which is growing in the teens kind of organically. So I wonder if you could walk us through your view of the sustainability of that longer-term and then how if those telecom deals are helping that and do you think that\u2019s a longer term driver too. And the second is on Paramount TV, Is that business profitable, then we are looking to the next couple of years at least $400 million of revenues how big of the revenue bucket can that be let\u2019s say two years out?","Robert Bakish","Sure. So on the international side, yes another very strong quarter for international, I think it speaks to the quality of the asset base and the execution, the affiliate fee growth per my remarks we had subscriber growth in terms of cumulative subs in every major geographies, so obviously more units or more subs that helps drive growth and if you look at again pay-TV penetration international versus domestic, we continue to believe there is a lot of upside there and continue to look to growth.","To your point on Telco, I think you probably meant mobile Telco, I couldn\u2019t quite hear, but we believe that\u2019s kind of a next frontier if you will, but it\u2019s a frontier that\u2019s already starting to happen, if you look at mobile subscribers in particular 4G subscribers, ex-U.S. there is over two billion of them, and obviously that\u2019s been growing and that\u2019s dramatically larger than the Pay-TV base.","And so between the Telef\u00f3nica deal in Latin America which kind of opens that up and there are some other deals we are working on there, between the European deals we are seeing and the Asian deals, that\u2019s starting to coming online, so we see very nice growth ahead and that being a real catalyst that will play out over coming years and ensure international continues to grow robustly.","Recently on Paramount TV, we see it being a $400 million business this year, at about 10% margin, if you looked at it today, we have 17 series ordered or in production, and that\u2019s what driving those numbers, obviously we recognize revenue on deliveries so we haven\u2019t recognized all the revenue from the stuff that\u2019s already going on.","And we have I believe the number is 19 additional series set up at networks, and that\u2019s really the pipeline of future growth, so we see this business continuing to ramp very significantly both in terms of revenue and contribution, There is no indication whatsoever that that demand is anything but strong.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thanks good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Advanced Advertising stuff, I don\u2019t know if there is a way for you to sort of isolate this for us, but how incremental is that revenue to the business as you guys work with advertisers and agencies to sell that inventory or is it simply shifting spending from linear to advanced? And then if I missed it I apologize, but Bob I don\u2019t think you mentioned OpenAP in your converse or weight in your conversation about the drivers there, I think NBC joined that platform, I\u2019m just curious if you could update us on whether that\u2019s still something you guys are excited about and how that fits into your overall Advanced Advertising strategy particularly on the upfront?","Wade Davis","Sure. So I will take it. Almost all of the Advanced Marketing Solutions revenue is incremental. There is only one place and it's really an overlap as we transition vantage campaigns to being fulfilled on the linear infrastructure, to being fulfilled on addressable infrastructure.","That\u2019s a little bit of an overlap and that the linear vantage campaigns we actualize them in-linear revenue and the benefit that we get from those is an uplift in pricing and yield, but when we talk to you about the $300 million of revenue that we see in 2018 that\u2019s incremental revenue.","And I mean we see as I said a moment ago, that is accelerating, it\u2019s going to almost double from this quarter to next quarter, for the full-year $300 million would represent about a little over 40% growth over last year, and we see that trajectory accelerating going beyond 2018.","In terms of OpenAP we think it\u2019s great progress, we now have the majority of the diversified media networks companies on OpenAP, the importance of that is that we continue to drive standardization around the trafficking buying of advanced ad campaigns that are traffic on targeted customer segments rather than broad demos.","And so, with everybody kind of moving towards that it's going to drive the standardization, which is going to drive liquidity and fluidity in the marketplace and help to grow that important segment of advertising for us and for all of the other industry participants.","Importantly, we also believe that our technology investments that we have been making in advantage and our targeting engine there is something that over the next few quarters you will see us start to prioritize and we actually believe that is going to materialize as an incremental revenue stream in licensing that somewhere out.","Benjamin Swinburne","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Rich Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield","Hi, thanks for taking the question. So I really wanted to ask about the milk and cookies at CBS, but I will instead focus on mobile distribution. First in the U.S. AT&T in quote the other day and said that if they win their lawsuit versus the DOJ which we think they will that they are going to launch a free for unlimited wireless subscriber video bundle without any broadcast networks nor the cable networks owned by those broadcast networks. That would seem to make Viacom content critical that to that AT&T watch product. Could you comment on what that status is and your thoughts around that type of domestic mobile distribution. And then two, Bob you talked about the international model for mobile distribution. I think investors are still trying to understand just generically without getting into the specifics of anyone deal overseas, but can you help us understand generically what a mobile distribution deal looks like relative to a traditional MVPD deal.","Robert Bakish","Sure Rich, happy to do that. So on AT&T like let's start with we have far ranging relationships with AT&T both on the distribution side spanning DirecTV Now and DirecTV as well of course on the advertising side both the PayTV and mobile. And I also want to note that we are very well carried on DirecTV now with 11 services so to your point that speaks to the importance of our services.","I have also said we are in the midst of many active discussions around next-generation distribution opportunities including mobile and skinny bundles, beyond that around any specifics but it's clearly now we were focused on.","To your second question on international mobile, the reality is there is a couple of different types of deals out there conceptually. We are obviously in the early days of this category. If you look at say the Telef\u00f3nica deal that deal looks almost exactly like a traditional MVPD deal where it's a monthly rate for sub and we carry ad avails in the product and it's distributed broadly to their sub days.","There is other forms of deals out there, for example in Indonesia there is a place where we are distributed two data to your sub and again get a fee for sub based on the data tiers. One of the Japanese deals is more ad supported. So again you got different models out there that are coalescing, but the important point is we are seeing real recognition that in a highly competitive.","And commoditized business which is what mobile is where they face declining ARPU in particular the voice segment and desperately need a growth driver to fund their CapEx video is rapidly becoming the obvious solution and again relative to four years ago the first time I went to Mobile World in Barcelona, the conversations are night and day and that\u2019s night and day is a positive, so we are very excited about the category.","Richard Greenfield","And then just to follow-up when you think about the U.S. should we assume that it looks more like Telef\u00f3nica?","Robert Bakish","That is certainly what we are working on.","Richard Greenfield","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif with Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you. I have two questions, one on Paramount, besides I mean obviously new management is doing a phenomenal job, but besides the film lineup, can you talk about some of the other changes that have been implemented or considered on the international side as well as windowing. And the second question the two clear growth drivers for you are the cost and Advanced Marketing Solutions, how unique are these two Viacom, in other words could these be applied to other media businesses in the event of any combination?","Robert Bakish","Sure. So, Jessica, on Paramount, let me start broadly, we have a highly talented and seasoned executive and Jim Gianopulos, running Paramount, he has brought in really an all star team across all aspects of the business including as you know at international, and they are systematically going through the business and improving its functionality and therefore ability to deliver value.","So places like the green light process has been totally overhauled with respect to how decisions are made and sort of the clinicality of that process and that is fundamentally new to better discussions and we believe although we will for sure in 2019 that that leads to better decisions and better film.","Obviously Jim comes out of international that\u2019s where he first built his reputation on the distribution side and continues to look for opportunities to strengthen our capabilities there, but you should think about it as creating a best-in-class studio across all dimensions and so it\u2019s not just one focus area. In terms of your second question on well - go ahead.","James Gianopulos","Okay. So I mean in terms of the sustainability, as Bob mentioned in his remarks, I mean we have a full-time team in place and this is a competency that we have been developing, in a sense the initial actions we took in 2017.","Our overwhelming focus is obviously pointing this at our own business and driving operating income growth and margin expansion out of the core and I think it\u2019s important to remind everybody that our current focus is on the non-programming cost base of domestic media networks.","There is some overlap with the international and Paramount around sourcing and standardization, but the point is that we have a significant amount of our cost base that we think we can continue to drive efficiencies out of it, so there is a lot of room to run on that.","The team that we have in place is really-really good at this and that\u2019s why we have decided to not only increase the amount of the savings that we are guiding you to, but also increase the magnitude of those savings, in terms of what we do with this capacity that we are growing, to the extent that there is incremental M&A we think that the capabilities of this team can obviously drive value on the back end of that.","Robert Bakish","But I think you asked a bigger question which goes to our overall growth strategy and I think the most important point here is it is multifaceted, it is not based on any one thing. Remember there is three key pieces to it, grow share and margins in the core of which the cost pieces that wage is articulated is part of it. It's accelerating participation next-generation platforms and solutions platforms is code for distribution solutions is code for ad sales and it's diversifying into incremental businesses or adjacent businesses with synergies for IP.","That's a strategy that is conceptually I suppose anyone could follow, but we have been pursuing that strategy because it fits very well with our asset mix, and we have built our team to execute against it, and is recently as the second quarter that were talking about today. You can see the progress and on executing it. So we are not betting entering to ranch on any one thing, we have many things going on in parallel, we feel very good about that combined ability to drive a sustainably growing Viacom.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you.","James Bombassei","Operator we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of John Hollic with UBS.","John Hollic","Thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up to our last question for Wade. Of the $100 million that you save in 2018, how much of that is you already seen so far in the first half. And [Technical Difficulty] then recognizing that all in the during the course of 2019 and maybe should we expect that to the sort of seen ratably through the year and maybe does it come from media net or Paramount or sort of overhead. And then lastly on the cost side, can you compare those savings to other say other incremental costs you may have especially related to B2C? Thanks.","Wade Davis","Sure. Actually John I miss the middle part of your question, but I think it was related to the over $300 million as run rate savings that we have talked about in 2019 and beyond, but let me - and if that\u2019s wrong you can follow-up, but let me start with the first part which is have we seen this cost materialize already.","So this is a broad portfolio of actions, it\u2019s actually over 300 discreet initiative that were in the process of implementing, over 90% of those initiatives are in process and with respect to the over $100 million of savings that we have indicated for fiscal 2018, all of those initiatives have been completed. So in the quarter as I said in my remarks, we actually got a five percentage points benefit from these initiatives in our SG&A line.","As it relates to going forward in 2019 and beyond the run rate savings that we are going to see is over $300 million. Those initiatives are also well underway and when you look at them, almost all of those are going to fall to the bottom line, we have built the team and the function in a way that drive compliance, so their very tight integration with finance.","So as we move through these processes and implement these specific initiatives there is especially the infrastructure in place to ensure that we are recognizing these savings on the bottom line in the context of our overall cost base. And in terms of how that fits with the rest of our cost base, we are going to continue to see - we are going to continue to be investing in content so overall content programming expense will continue to grow in the mid-single digits, but we actually believe from SG&A standpoint we can continue the trajectory of improving and reducing SG&A expenses overall in 2019 and beyond.","John Hollic","Great. Thanks Wade.","Robert Bakish","We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22105":["Viacom Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our December quarter earnings call.","Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.","I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on the call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","Before we begin I want to note that while we put out a statement last week, announcing the establishment of a special committee of independent directors to evaluate a potential combination with CBS, we will not be responding to any questions or comments about that process. The purpose of today's call is to discuss our first quarter results and performance.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.","Three months ago, we told you that if 2017 was about stabilizing and revitalizing Viacom then 2018 is all about transforming our company for the future. We said, we would fast-track our evolution into next-generation platforms and solutions that we'd further expand our business beyond TV and film, all grow in share and margins in our existing core business.","-->","[Author:G]","I'm happy to say that we accelerated these transformation efforts in the first quarter making important strategic progress. On the numbers, let me remind you that on the last call, we talked about Q1 and the first half of 2018 as being transitional quarters, which would not fully reflect the value of our strategy. At the same time, I want you to note that we are on track for growth in the second half of the year and in fact, now see upside to our prior guidance.","So, let's start with our progress growing share and margins in our core business. The first headline here, our flagship focus continues to work. Overall flagship share growth continued in the quarter, bright spots include MTV and BET, which are now in their third consecutive quarter of ratings growth.","In fact, MTV was the second fastest growing major cable network in Primetime. And beyond the flagships, VH1, CMT, and TV Land also grew ratings in the quarter. ","-->","[Author:G]","And of course, Viacom's flagship strategy is what led to our most ambitious rebrand yet, with the launch of Paramount Network last month. Kicking off with a live Lip Sync Battle at Adobe Theater, Paramount Network quickly followed-up with the first episodes of Waco, a high-quality cinematic mini-series, it's on a clear message to talent and business partners that we're playing to win in the premium content space.","-->","[Author:G]","While it's early days at Paramount Network, the results so far are encouraging. In its launch week, the Network reached 12.1 million viewers in the highly coveted 18 to 49 demographic, an increase of nearly 20% versus the prior week.","Up next, Heathers, a modern-day re-imagining of the 80's classic film, then American Woman, which stars Alicia Silverstone and Mena Suvari amid the rise of feminism in the 1970s, followed by Yellowstone, an epic and cinematic, dramatic series created by Taylor Sheridan and starring Kevin Costner.","The second headline in our core business, we're continuing efforts to strengthen traditional revenue streams and we see an improving picture relative to three months ago. In the quarter, domestic affiliate revenue was in line with previous guidance and we now anticipate better than expected results throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, as we benefit from our partner first approached with distributors.","-->","[Author:G]","I'm happy to tell you that our return to carriage with Suddenlink was effectuated in the first quarter, and as of February, our largest networks are back to their previous fully penetrated positions across Charter's most widely distributed tier. Something that has happened faster than we initially anticipated. That combined with stronger than expected VMVPD performance has resulted in our subscriber trends improving to the mid-2% decline range from the mid-3% range, we had previously discussed.","In fact, we now believe full-year domestic affiliate revenue will decline on the low-end of mid-single-digits, a 200-basis point improvement versus the guidance we gave you in the prior quarter.","Moving to ad sales, in the first quarter, worldwide advertising revenue gains were driven by the continued strong performance of Viacom International Media Networks partially offset by universe [ph] declines and rating challenges at certain networks domestically.","However, we believe we have reached a turning point in our domestic advertising story. As digital revenues continue to grow strongly, audience share improves and Charter and Suddenlink subs are back in our distribution.","-->","[Author:G]","We now expect domestic ad revenue to improve sequentially, over the balance of the year with positive growth in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we expect continued strong growth across our international networks.","The third headline in our core business. The turnaround of Paramount Pictures is well within sight. With Q1 behind us, we now have just a few films left on our legacy slate. And we are particularly excited about our Summer Tentpole, which has Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt returning for the sixth installment of the incredibly successful Mission Impossible series.","Very importantly, we have now finished building out our best-in-class leadership team at Paramount, including the recent additions of Wick Godfrey, President of Motion Picture Group, and David Sameth, the new Head of Worldwide Marketing who joins from Disney Pixar.","With his team in place, Jim Gianopulos is laser-focused on returning the studio to growth. And we're very excited about how the 29 team slate is coming together, including the fact that we anticipate half the slate will be co-branded productions through our Paramount Players division, which focuses on driving attractive economics on a fast production cycle. With eight branded films planned for 2019, Paramount Pictures is bringing Viacom's flagship brands to the big screen in a big way, which Viacom is uniquely positioned to do.","And with three new major production deals signed with Hasbro, Skydance and the Fast and Furious producer Neal Moritz, plus Wick Godfrey's immense film experience at the helm, we'll be able to further feed the studio's pipeline in the years ahead, including bringing to life exciting tent pole films like a Transformer spin-off Bumblebee, Gemini Man, a Top Gun sequel and more.","Building on the successes of 2017, Paramount Television continues to expand TV production relationships with top talent, including George Clooney, who will direct and star in Catch-22, a limited series for Hulu, and John Krasinski as the new Jack Ryan in the series picked up by Amazon.","Additionally, the Alienist, a limited series for TMT just premiered as Cable's number one new drama series this season in live-plus-three. With win after win, Paramount continues to gain credibility in the space and it's doing so, in an environment where demand has never been stronger.","Before I move on from the core business, I also like to note that we are on track with our cost transformation initiatives and efforts to improve margins. This quarter saw Viacom make meaningful progress, including through an organizational realignment that reunites all support functions across Viacom Media Networks, new sourcing and procurement policies, real estate consolidation and more. All told, we anticipate these initiatives will deliver $100 million in cost savings this year and generate hundreds of millions of savings on an annual run rate basis.","Moving beyond the core business to our second area of strategic focus, accelerating our efforts in next-generation platforms and solutions, this has been a huge area of focus for our company and we're thrilled with our progress in dramatically ramping up our digital efforts. One of the most important developments on this front in the quarter was the launch of Viacom Digital Studios, the digital studio is now executing against the clear vision to produce unique video content at scale to build loyalty and engagement for our flagship brands, to become the first choice home for a wide range of young talent, to develop an ecosystem where our massive social footprint supports a wide range of partnerships and distribution models, and to create a diversified, profitable digital business.","Our goals for this division are ambitious. We are going to increase video views to 2x in 2018, we are also going to increase watch time on YouTube and Facebook by 3.5 times by the end of the year. And VDS isn't just focused on short-form content production, they are working closely with our ad sales and distribution teams to evolve our offerings to mobile and OTT platforms and creatively connect partners to our brands and talent, which is one of the reasons why we recently acquired WHOSAY, an early mover and influence marketing with a strong track record of executing campaigns for major brands. ","-->","[Author:G]","WHOSAY will work with Viacom digital studios and our ad sales team to produce premium original content, innovative advertising solutions and truly multi-platform distribution for our brand partners.","In addition to ad supported social video, VDS is also partnering with our distribution team to power our products for digital and mobile platforms. Here, we are already in a range of discussions with carriers in U.S. who see the combination of our existing news and entertainment brands, tent pole events and new digital native series and talent as a potentially compelling new source of value in a very competitive marketplace. ","And outside the U.S., we're already bringing product to mobile. Earlier this week, we announced a major step forwarded in the mobile entertainments space working with Telefonica in Latin America.","In a first for Telefonica and its mobile and broadband subscribers, their mobile platform Movistar Play will carry live feeds of MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Junior, Comedy Central and the Paramount channel across Latin America, beginning in the first half of fiscal 2018.","In addition, Telefonica will have on-demand content available via our mobile streaming apps and its important note that economically this looks like a traditional Pay-TV deal with monthly affiliate revenue per subscriber.","This first of a kind deal for Viacom is a critical first step in what we talked about on our last call, bringing a new product to new distributors on a global basis. As we've said before, we believe mobile is a big opportunity globally and we're focused on quickly unlocking it. ","Finally, as we discussed on our last call, we continue to expect to launch a significant and differentiated direct to consumer experience by the end of this fiscal year.","Moving to our third strategic priority, diversifying beyond our core business, as we said on the last call, we believe there is a lot of opportunity to expand and grow our live events and consumers product businesses in particular, and we made some important progress in Q1.","Building on the success of our International events business, every flagship brand now will have a live event in U.S. including Comedy Central's recently renewed Clusterfest, BET's BET Experience, and Nickelodeon's upcoming SLIMEFEST. ","And even Viacom Digital Studios will have its own tent pole event. We just announced our acquisition of VidCon, the largest and most popular multi-day conference celebrating online video. This partnership will feed our next-gen and live events businesses placing Viacom at the center of the important conversations, innovations, and talent driving the future of content.","Think about this as VDS's VMAs. Here on Broadway, the SpongeBob Musical is also off to a very strong start, following its highly acclaimed debut. We're also making meaningful strides to grow our consumer products business.","Last call, we said we wanted to start putting our global CP infrastructure and expertise to work for other brands beyond our own. And in Q1, we struck a deal with Mattel to be their exclusive U.S. agent for Thomas the Tank Engine across many key non-toy CP categories. A strategy you'll be hearing more about in the coming year.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Wade, I want to discuss our International business, which is firing on all cylinders.","In the quarter, International had double-digit growth in overall revenues, affiliate sales and ad sales, and very strong double-digit growth in earnings. And there is a bigger strategic story underlying those numbers.","International strong track record of creating new incremental value across a variety of markets and models, like in India, where through our joint venture Viacom18, we took a loss-making business and turn it into a fast-growing top three diversified media and entertainment company with revenues up over $500 million.","Last week, we announced a transaction with our partner where we would sell 1% of the business at a $2 billion valuation. We did this deal to set the company up for its next wave of growth by more closely aligning with our partner's affiliated Jio platform, one of the largest and fastest growing mobile, broadband and video distribution platforms in India, having grown to 160 million subs in just over a year since launch.","This is fantastic for Viacom18 and for Viacom since we retain a 49% stake. We're very excited about the road ahead.","The latest success story for international is in Latin America. One year ago, we bought Telefe, a dominant local broadcaster in Argentina. Today, it's serving as a platform for global growth.","Let me explain. We acquired Telefe because we knew we wanted more scale in Latin America across audience, advertising and distribution. We also knew we wanted to own more content and production capabilities to satisfy the huge and growing demand for quality Spanish language content to feed global platforms, both ours and others.","When we acquired Telefe, they were producing 3500 hours of high-quality content per year yet monetized little beyond their own network. As a standalone market specific broadcaster, they didn't play in larger markets beyond Argentina, including Latin America more broadly, Spain, U.S. Hispanic, the Middle East and Africa, all of which have high demand for Latin originated Telenovelas. ","So, we spent the last year creating what we call our Latin orbit, combining Telefe's power and production capabilities with Viacom's global footprint to set Viacom up to be a true player in the global Spanish language content distribution business.","We started increasing IP ownership of Telefe content by retaining majority rights including International distribution. And we consolidated our content sales teams to capitalize on Telefe's volume.","While year one was really about laying the foundation for future growth, we expect to exceed the revenues generated by all but the largest well-established content studio players in 2018.","Output hours have increased by 12% and we project overall content sales to increase by 70% this year. All of our Telefe network maintained its position as the number one free-to-air channel in Argentina and we anticipate growing overall operating for Telefe by 40% this year and we are just getting started. Our goal is to quickly become, one of the top creators and distributors of Spanish and Latin content in the world and we are already on a path to get there.","I 'l now pass it over to Wade to take you through the numbers.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Bob and good morning. We're pleased to report our financial results for the December quarter of fiscal 2018. As we guided, we continue to experience short-term transitional impacts from the stabilization of our distribution base that are reflected in today's numbers. However, as Bob discussed, we have made meaningful progress on a number of important strategic initiatives since our last call and we are seeing more favorable trends and key metrics, such as our domestic Pay-TV subscribers.","These actions in trends will lay the foundation for growth and revenue OI and EPS in the second half of 2018 and beyond.","Before I speak to our adjusted results, I want to note that we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $103 million in the quarter, primarily due to the enactment of tax reform legislation. This amount principally consists of a reduction of our net deferred tax liabilities, partly offset by a one-time expense related to the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings.","I am going to speak to the impact on both our book and cash taxes from tax reform, later in my remarks. But it is important to note that Viacom has been historically a full tax payer, with the overwhelming majority of its earnings in the U.S. Accordingly, we will be a significant beneficiary of these changes going forward.","Now turning to our consolidated results. I would point you to slide four of our earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Total company revenue declined 8%, principally driven by fewer theatrical releases and legacy slate under performance at film and entertainment. Consolidated Media Networks revenue decreased slightly with the domestic affiliate declines more than offsetting strength in worldwide advertising and ancillary revenue growth.","Turning to slide five. Our adjusted operating income declined 4% to $717 million. This reflects an improvement at film and entertainment and a decline of Media Networks. Media Networks' decline was driven by the previously mentioned revenue decline, combined with marketing and content expenses associated with the January 18 launch of the Paramount Network.","Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 reflects the lower effective tax rate from tax reform and lower interest expense from our continued reduction of debt.","Turning to our segment results, slide six of our earnings presentation provides an overview of our Media Networks segment. Worldwide Media Networks revenues for the quarter were $2.6 billion, driven by strong international performance offset by domestic declines.","Domestic revenues decreased 6% to $1.9 billion, while international revenues increased 18% to $631 million.","On an organic basis, absent of five percentage point favorable foreign currency impact and a six-percentage point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenues would have grown 7% in the quarter.","Worldwide advertising revenues increased 1% and ancillary revenues were up 5%, while affiliate revenues declined 4%. Adjusted operating income declined by 7% to $913 million owing to domestic revenue performance as well as higher ad, promotion and original programming expense associated with the launch of Paramount Network.","Including the pre-launch expenses, aggregate programming and SG&A expense increased 1% and 6% respectively. In line with the guidance, we provided last quarter, domestic affiliate revenues decreased 8%, reflecting subscriber declines as well as rate reset associated with our successful efforts to stabilize our distribution base.","Domestic advertising revenues in the quarter declined 5% percent due to lower linear impressions, partially offset by higher pricing and robust growth in digital ad revenue.","Our expectations for domestic affiliate revenue for fiscal 2018 have improved since we last provided guidance. I am happy to report that we expect full year domestic affiliate revenues to decline at the low end of mid-single-digits, an improvement of approximately 200 basis points from our previous guidance.","Our improved outlook is based on the earlier than anticipated reinstatement of subscribers and accelerating growth at our virtual MVPD partners. In terms of seasonality, we anticipate that the domestic affiliate revenues in both the March and June quarters will decline in-line with the full year rate of decline, while the September quarter should decline in the low single-digits.","We expect that the momentum we gain in the back half of 2018 will set us up to return to domestic growth as we get into fiscal 2019, and benefit from rate escalator that lags [ph] the one-time impact of rate resets. ","In the March quarter, we see sequential improvement in domestic ad sales with declines in the low to mid-single-digit. We expect performance to improve steadily and sequentially over the remainder of the year reaching positive growth in the fourth quarter, this will be driven by ratings improvement we expect from new original programming coming on air, greater carriage benefits from improved distributor penetration and accelerating contributions from digital and dreadful [ph] initiatives.","Lastly, we had a strong quarter on our media networks ancillary business, reflecting our push into adjacent businesses that leverage our core brands and IP. For the quarter, domestic ancillary revenues grew 8% to $85 million, critically claimed a successful launch of SpongeBob Musical as well as higher gaming revenues with a primary driver of growth from the quarter.","We expect ongoing benefit from our diversification efforts and anticipate continued growth from this line of business over the course of the year.","Now turning to international media networks on slide seven. Performance continued to be strong with 18% growth in revenue and strong double-digit growth in operating income contribution. International affiliate revenues increased 18% driven by organic growth as well as the five percentage points favorable impact from foreign currency. ","Advertising revenues increased 22%, absent of five percentage point favorable impact from foreign currency and a 10-percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe, organic international advertising revenues would have been up 7%.","This organic performance reflects continued strength in Europe. As Bob mentioned, international is pacing ahead of our original plan and will continue to be an important engine of growth for Viacom.","For the balance of this fiscal year, we see opportunities for enhanced growth in affiliate revenues and expect full-year growth to improve to low double-digit, even growth in Latin America and our extended and expanded India JV licensing agreement. International ad revenues are expected to continue to be strong with growth in the low to mid-teens for fiscal 2018. ","We now expect the full year growth rate for worldwide programming expense to be in the low single-digits, as we continue to invest in our flagship networks of benefiting from a shift in mix to non-scripted programming and from leveraging our content across multiple platforms and multiple networks on a worldwide basis.","Given the timing of shows coming on air, we expect programming expense growth to be weighed for the June quarter. Given the momentum that's materializing in the performance of our growth initiatives, including advanced marketing and advertising solution, live events, and new digital experiences, we will be increasing our associated investments to fuel our second half of 2018 and beyond revenue growth. ","Accordingly, we anticipate that worldwide distribution and other expenses will grow double-digits for the full year.","As Bob noted, we've also made progress on our initiatives to grow share margins and profitability in our core businesses. Earlier this week, we took initial steps on our plans to reinvent our cost base and we're on track to realized cost savings of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2018, and we project hundreds of millions of dollars additional run rate savings, most of which will be realized by fiscal 2019, and will drop to the bottom line.","It is important to note that none of our cost reinvention strategies are targeted at programming expense. We continue to invest to grow the success of our flagship networks.","Taking all together, we see upside and media networks full-year adjusted operating income, as we benefit from both improved outlook for affiliate revenues and from improved international profitability. ","Now turning to film and entertainment on slide eight of our earnings presentation. Although the performance of the films from the legacy slate was disappointing, we are extremely bullish on Paramount's continued execution of its turnaround strategy, the build-out of its 2019 slate and ramping up of TV production.","In the quarter, revenues were down 28% to $544 million, reflecting the under performance of the legacy slate and fewer theatrical releases. Adjusted operating income improved $50 million to a loss of $130 million in the quarter. This was driven by lower operating expenses which were a function of the mix and number of theatrical releases, as well the studio's focus on more efficient marketing spend.","For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect Paramount to generate a meaningful improvement in the bottom-line compared to fiscal 2017. However, given the soft performance of certain December quarter releases, this improvement will be somewhat less than we had originally anticipated.","Turning to fiscal 2019, the slate will reflect the studio's new strategy and cost discipline. Accordingly, half of the 2019 slate will be co-branded films and six of the films have production budgets of $25 million or less. The 2019 slate looks great and we are excited for a new era at Paramount.","Now moving below, the line, in terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% under the new tax legislation, as compared to 30.8% in the prior year. For the full year, we are now forecasting a rate of approximately 25%, which compares to our prior guidance of 31%.","Given our September fiscal year-end, our fiscal 2018 U.S. tax rate is a pro-rated rate. We will continue to refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of domestic versus international profitability. From a cash tax perspective in fiscal 2018, we expect to see a benefit of approximately $200 million in the new tax law.","The components of free cash flow are broken out on slide 12 of the earnings presentation. We had a cash use of $16 million, which compares to $113 million of operating free cash flow last year. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally driven by higher working capital utilization due to the ramp-up in film and TV production.","The significant ramp in the size of Paramount slate from 10 films in 2018 to 16 films in 2019 will drive incremental working capital consumption for the year, which we expect to more than offset the cash tax benefits from tax reform.","Since we announced our strategic plan a year ago, including our commitment to reduce leverage and maintain investment grade metrics, we have made meaningful progress, reducing our gross debt by approximately $3 billion or 23%. During the quarter, we used our excess cash to redeem over $1 billion of senior notes and debentures.","Accordingly, at quarter end, we had $10.2 billion of total debt outstanding and cash of $394 million. Our debt was principally fixed rate with a weighted average cost of under 5%. If you take into consideration, the equity credit, we received from S&P and Fitch on our hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter end was $9.5 billion. And we plan to continue to pursue opportunities to delever over the course of fiscal 2018, including using our excess free cash flow to redeem debt.","Wrapping up, we've accomplished a lot over the past year, having stabilized our operations and implemented new initiatives to drive long-term growth. We see a return to growth in the back half of the year, with upside in domestic affiliate revenues, international operations and our media networks cost structure.","The negative impacts of the Paramount's legacy slate are largely behind us and we're looking forward to welcoming in a new era at the studio with the fiscal 2019 slate. We are extremely pleased with our progress and believe that the execution of our strategic initiatives will continue to deliver results.","And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Thank you, Wade. In closing, now roughly 14 months into our journey, to revitalize and reinvent Viacom, we couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made and more energized and excited about the opportunity ahead.","We believe in our ability to execute and we believe in our asset mix, which is compelling and includes world-class production capabilities that continue to build on one of the largest and most powerful libraries across television, film and now digital maintenance.","This content engine powers a broadly distributed set of Viacom branded services that are market leaders with the audiences they serve, and it feeds a growing ecosystem of partner platforms. Within that, we own one of just a handful of Hollywood studios one on a clear path to regaining its iconic status across film and television and a truly powerful International creative, distribution and monetization infrastructure which continues to grow rapidly.","We also see a broad opportunity set including potentially game-changing mobile distribution B2C advanced advertising and valuable extensions across consumer products and experiences. And we're on a clear path to unlock all of them.","Behind all of it we have a strong team and reenergize company culture and in an incredible set of creative advertising distribution and broader commercial partners whom we thank for working with us every day and with whom we look to do more.","Thank you for your time and support. We look forward to updating you as our journey continues. And now, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JP Morgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions first can you provide a bit more color on the recent management changes at the media network specifically Nickelodeon and then just staying on Nickelodeon, what can be done if anything to improve ratings there, it seems like your program is really strong, but it's more of an issue if you were spending less time on your TV. I guess how fast can digital ramp and are you forecasting ratings improvement at Nick in order to get back to the positive ad revenue growth you would achieve at the end of the year?","Robert Bakish","Sure. Thanks, Alexia. So, first of all there has been no change in leadership at Nickelodeon, but in light of media speculation and kind of confusion on this matter, I'd like to clarify a few points. ","Sarah Levy has been promoted to a newly created position as COO of Viacom Media Networks. That means we're bringing all our media network shared services under one structure and to be clear, this is about the shared support structure, it is an extension of the responsibility Sarah has held for the last year and that extension is to BET and to Nickelodeon. ","-->","Sarah and each of the brand Presidents will continue to report to me and as with our other efforts. The intent here is to streamline our structure, break down silos and ensure we are as efficient and agile as we can be.","[Author:G]","-->","[Author:G]","-->","[Author:G]","Now, on the Nickelodeon side, it's true we've had some rating softness at Nick and we're actively working to address it in two parallel paths one on television and one beyond television.","So, first the television point. Truth be told it's not the first time we've seen softness at Nick and we've turned it around and Seema and her team are very focused on this. We have a robust slate of about 400 premier episodes coming up and those 400 episodes are across 15 series that are across the board strong. And we will be supplementing that with some incremental stunting and marketing.","And just to give you an example, we debut a new series last week, Hunter Street, it's a serialized Novella and that show built each day. So, a lot of work going on the TV rating side and despite some of the headwinds with the parts, we feel good about our trajectory as the year plays out. ","But we are also working aggressively to build to your point our non-TV impressions, this includes ramping up our social video strategy, particularly through VDS, where we see a significant opportunity to capture share and add dollars.","It also includes continuing to grow Naagin, there we're going to add the power patrol franchise, that's something that hasn't been available on Naagin, and obviously is a worldwide hit as well as adding more educational content and supporting all of that with some increased marketing.","Finally, there is the live event side, we talked about it SpongeBob, the Musical and International property called SLIMEFEST which is coming to the U.S. this summer.","So, a lot of work going on at Nickelodeon and I am feeling very good about what the team is doing there. Also, worth touching on Nick at Night since that's the back half of Nickelodeon, there we had some ratings of softness in the quarter two.","However, we have recently made three programming moves there bringing Two and a Half Men and The Goldberg's, which are two very strong series to Nick at Night and then also doing some things with movies, a couple of night a week. And as we have done that we have seen demand [ph] ratings already start to move in the right direction.","So, lot of attention on this area, but again I feel good about everything we have underway.","Operator","All right. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis of Jefferies.","John Janedis","Thank you. You guys touched on this a bit but as you know the market has been nervous about your domestic distribution and affiliate growth, so can you just talk a little more about your confidence level and the improvement and to what extent that hinges on either the entertainment path launch for some sort of new deal with a Virtual MVPD?","Robert Bakish","Sure. So, John look, we really have a multi-part strategy in the distribution side, which encompasses the MVPD universe, the VMVPD universe and unlocking the next wave of opportunity, particularly in mobile. So, let me touch on each.","As you know, 2017 was really a year of transforming and stabilizing our relationships in the MVPD space, there you saw us implement a new strategy which is more relationship driven and bring incremental value to the table, beyond licensing, linear fee, putting more in the on-demand space, dense advertising partnerships and in some cases, co-production relationships.","That strategy is clearly working for us. And as we said before through those efforts we renewed or extended half of our sub-base. And worth noting that we have no significant MVPD renewal on the near-term horizon.","So, feeling very good about that and I would also remark that all that was done at a time where our flagship strategy really wasn't effectuated yet and we hadn't begun to see the audience improvements that we're now seeing.","So, as we go into longer-term renewals, which again there is no renewals on the near-term horizon. We're also going to benefit from the stronger product line, which I think is key. Then there is a VMVPD space, there we represented on the two largest by far OTT platforms, those are DIRECTV Now and Sling, and as I remarked earlier, there we're seeing nice growth in fact it's turning out to be more of a driver for the overall category that we had initially contemplated, so we feel great about that.","We did launch with Philo, that's still in its shake-down [ph] phase, hasn't gone to its marketing phase. So that should yield more benefit in the future. And we continue to have conversations with other players in this space.","Finally, mobile that's really the next wave of opportunity. We are in conversations with multiple carriers literally as we speak in the U.S. and I think again I'd point to Telefonica as an example of the future because that is really a great deal for us and we'll have significant benefits.","So, a lot going on this space, but I feel very good about our trajectory far better than I felt this time last year.","Wade Davis","Just one thing I'd like to underscore to that John you said, you asked if the improved guidance that we laid out hinges on any incremental virtual MVPD launch, the answer is that it doesn't any incremental virtual MVPD progress that we make and any sort of domestic mobile product that we bring to market like the Telefonica product that we announced that would be incremental upside, beyond the upside that we already guided to.","John Janedis","Thanks Wade. That's helpful. And then one quick thing Bob, there has been a lot of noise around the health of the ad market, given the audience fragmentation, so when you speak to the return to growth how broad of ratings improvement do you need to get there and get there and does that assume that you can get to industry like growth because that's something you really haven't done in a while probably a few years? And I guess related to that what is the contribution from digital?","Wade Davis","Yeah. Look, the softness that we had in domestic ad sales this quarter was a function of linear impression decline, which in turn was some linear rating softness principally at Nick. But it was also driven by the gaps in distribution that we had in the quarter.","It's important to note that those gaps as Bob said in his remarks have now been filled with Suddenlink carriage fully penetrated in the achievement of full penetration on Charter's most likely distributed tier.","So, having accomplished that, that's going to add a couple points of domestic ad sales growth going forward, so that is obviously something that underscores our confidence.","With respect to your digital question that's the place where we're seeing great momentum as you know. We have some of the strongest advanced ad sales capabilities in the marketplace. We saw nearly 40% growth over the prior year's quarter in our advanced marketing and solutions business. So that's also a place that we see momentum ramping over the course of the year.","And we further bolstered the capabilities in advanced, our advanced marketing solutions business with the recent acquisition of WHOSAY which brings us substantial incremental capacity in our network branded entertainment and solutions.","And then we also announced VidCon, VidCon is another place where we grow out our capacity in experiential marketing there are big domestic event is in June so that brings great capacity online in that category to supplement the growth that we are seeing in things like the BET Experience, Clusterfest and now the SLIMEFEST coming online for our experiential business.","So, the return to growth is actually really driven by a pretty broad portfolio of initiatives all of which we have pretty strong visibility into and it starts on the head start that we get going into this quarter with the penetration that's kind of head of what we had initially expected, so that's why we are confident in the sequential and consistent growth over the course of the year and the return to growth in the fourth quarter.","John Janedis","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield of BTIG.","Rich Greenfield","Hi, thanks for taking the question, actually I have two. One just philosophical, I guess for Bob. I realize you are not going to talk about CBS given Jim's comments at the opening\\, but we had the Disney-Fox transaction last quarter obviously discoveries in the process of buying scripts, which I know you were interested in as well, maybe if you could just talk about scale, do you need more scale or not even do you need, how would more scale help Viacom and especially when you think about Paramount, there is a lot of noise about Sony right now and other studios that might become available, ","Wondering how you think about your appetite for, if the Disney Studio isn't that scale and neither Fox, it would seem to me that Paramount definitely needs more scale through other studio acquisitions and just how do you think about that?","And then just the second question, Wade touched on the Paramount Television business, obviously the film slate you were left with is the films slate, but it's obviously disappointing, but when you think about the TV side of the business, it seems like that's a business that doesn't get a lot of focus wondering where are you in terms of earnings on an annual basis on the TV side of the film, of the studio and how you see that progressing and becoming more meaningful over the next couple of years.","Robert Bakish","Sure. Thanks, Rich. So, I'll take the first part. Look, there is a lot going on in the industry, there is a lot of conversation about scale but through that noise, let me reiterate we are excited about the progress we're making, our assets mix and our competitive position as we execute against our strategy to enhance shareholder value. ","And I want to highlight, international and Paramount are key points of differentiation and advantage for Viacom. We do see a clear path to organic growth through growing share and margins in our core business, accelerating our participation in next-generation platforms and solutions and diversifying into related businesses with synergies and we talked about that. ","All that said, we will, of course, continue to look at M&A and other partnership opportunities, because you can get benefits to scale off and without actually acquiring a company, we'll do so in a disciplined manner and look at ways we can potentially accelerate our strategy execution and create value. ","Two recent examples of that are WHOSAY and VidCon both which are essentially announced in the last week and both which clearly accelerate our strategy in terms of capabilities, in terms of top-line, top-line growth and in terms of value for our partners. ","On the Paramount side, it's a highly valuable asset. I am thrilled with the leadership team under Jim Gianopulos and the slate they put together and quite frankly, the creative thinking they have, because they are not looking at the business in the same old way, they are also thinking about other things they can do, and I would highlight that this fast Disney transaction should have come to pass, but even in this sort of unknown stage it's actually increasing the value of Paramount and there's plenty of people out there who are coming to Paramount every day wanting to do business with that and believing in the potential of this iconic studio. So again, we're overwhelmingly focused on organic execution and we see a lot of potential ahead, Wade the second part?","Wade Davis","Yeah, with respect to Paramount TV that's been a huge success story in terms of when it's going to start contributing meaningfully to profitability that will be in 2019 we expect that business to be significantly over $400 million in revenue in 2019 and as we reached as we go into its first year of profitability it should be operating at or above 10% margin.","It's important to note that that's a biz but all of that is achieved within just under three years of having launched that business. It's also important to underscore the strategic positioning of Paramount TV within the overall portfolio mix so all the financial permit side just described is really been driven by product it's being licensed by third parties.","But there are critical synergies with respect to the Viacom networks where we have either five shows on air or in late phases of development to fuel our flagship brands and then the last point I would just note that Bob actually hit this a little bit in his remarks but having these content creation capabilities at such a premium level is one of the things that's really been able to allow us to deepen and expand our MVPD partnerships who are looking for exclusive premium content as part of their mix to drive penetration and retention so Paramount TV is a huge success story in one that not only is going to contribute meaningfully to our financial growth but it is also a critical strategic asset for us.","Robert Bakish","And I would just say look at the product, go watch the Alienist and when Jack Ryan comes out watch it. It is and we're just putting out the incredible product and it's really part of bringing that iconic studio back.","Rich Greenfield","And maybe just give us a sense of how diversified in terms of who you're producing for I don't think everyone realizes how live that that array of partners is?","Robert Bakish","Yeah, great point Rich, thank you. Look, we're producing for in-house networks, things like School of Rock for Nickelodeon, we have a number of projects in development for the Paramount network including first Wide Club - in fact, one at Paramount we're also as part of this Telefe conversation looking at creating an English language show in parallel to what are the Novellas down there a very attractive economics.","In addition to in-house clients back to Paramount we're producing four call it traditional Cable Networks like the Turner Networks with Alienist as an example. We're producing for kind of new age networks, Catch-22 is for Hulu, Jack Ryan is for Amazon, so again and then Wade mentioned in the context of our Charter renewal we have a co-production relationship with them. So, this asset plays in a variety of configurations and is really part of the value creation that you began to see, and we'll continue to see ahead.","Rich Greenfield","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions I want to ask you about the Telefonica deal in Latin America and also your direct-to-consumer plans. We were obviously familiar with the traditional distribution model can you put a little more sort of color on what a mobile agreement looks like how that might translate into other relationships in that region or globally, you mentioned it's per month per sub to those economics tend to look sort of similar to a television deal or anything you can help us to sort of size that or think about the opportunity to build off of that?","And then direct-to-consumer a lot of the media company is moving down this pass, when you think about launching something by the end of this fiscal year can you tell us a little bit about whether that would be a U.S. or global launch how much content you might be able to bring to there and also is there any impact at all in your existing NDP relationships where you would - theory start competing with them a little bit?","Robert Bakish","Sure. So, let me get the first part on your Telefonica question. Again, this is a Latin America deal, it is about Telefonica rolling out five of our brands MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Junior, Comedy Central, what we call Paramount Channel XUS to be movie star play platform for their subscribers. It is Pan-Latin America, so it is not just one country, we build off an existing relationship we haven't with Telefonica in Latin America, there were also a Pay-TV distributor or MVPD, but this is a mobile complemented act. It is a sense, revenue per sub economics which are comparable to Pay-TV rates and it's really the first and what we believe will be a series as many, where we unlock that platform to drive incremental reach for our brands and of course incremental monetization.","It's worth noting that we're in numerous conversations similar to this all around the world and as I indicated we're in a set of conversation with multiple carriers in the U.S. And if you think about it this is the point that upends the whole argument with a client of Pay-TV. Because mobile is the most ubiquitous platform in the world and mobile subscribers outnumber Pay-TV subscribers by many, many, many multiples there are literally billions of them out there.","The business the mobile business highly commoditized and competitive and carriers are looking for differentiation and there is just enormous road ahead and therefore, I'm thrilled to be talking about Telefonica but it's really the tip of the iceberg.","Wade Davis","So, I mean in terms of B2C as we said in our remarks we are not yet prepared to fully announce the offering but we're very confident that we're going to be in a position to do so soon and then as we said launch it within the fiscal year. What I can say is that it's going to be significant and it's also going to be differentiated from what's in the marketplace today.","You asked about U.S. versus global initially it's going to be rolled out in the U.S., in terms of the amount of content that it's going to have, it's going to have tens of thousands of hours of content that cut across the library we have on a global basis. And it's important to note one of the reasons that we are able to do this is that we've chosen to curtail the amount of content that we license into third-party B2C experiences that the decision that we have made when Bob rolled out his strategic plan last year and although that had some short-term pain for us because unlike some of our competitors we've not been able to get the short-term revenue kick from licensing to third party SVOD.","It's really important that we've kind of built in that library to be able to use for our own strategic purposes and fuel offerings like this. In terms of the impact on our MVPD community, it's going to be a fundamentally different product and in fact at least one of our MVPD partners is looking at incorporating this into their broader product as an important complement to their offerings.","[Author:G]","So, you should assume that we are really putting all of Viacom's assets against this so not only the content library that I talked about but we're also going to leverage the power of our brands and the audience in activating the audience that they already have leadership positions in and kind of the important categories of kids and family, you can music comedy African-American and urban and also the general entertainment presence that we have in our building with Paramount, Paramount TV and now the Paramount Network and then also we're going to leverage our ad sales force we broadly acknowledged to have the leading advanced ad sale capability in the television landscape.","We have relationships with the world's largest advertisers. So, those are some of the at that when you think about Viacom bringing it's kind of full power to bear on launching something really different in the marketplace.","Probably the last thing that, that's important to just to mention is that although we're able to leverage all of these assets and that's kind of an important tailwind and platform for us to build on. It is going to require some investment. But I do want to really underscore that any investment that we are going to make in this business is already embedded in our guidance.","Robert Bakish","I just want to add one thing to Wade's remarks which is you asked what MVPD, we do not view this as an MVPD substitute product there has been a recent example in the marketplace, where someone had a substitute product and an MVPD, therefore, chose not to carry them anymore we view this very much as MVPD complement product.","-->","[Author:G]","And I know that sounds cryptic and we are going to have to leave it at that until we announce it but MVPDs MVMVPDs for that matter are critically important for Viacom we've done a lot of work to build our relationships with them in the last 14 months we continue to do that work, they continue to be very important to us. And so, this is a product that we think works in that ecosystem.","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Michael Nathanson of Moffett.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks, Bob. I have two quick ones, one on strategy and one Wade in the working capital. So, Bob two things just walk us through the rationale to sell that Indian stake to what percent and what does the change of structure provide in terms of growth opportunities ahead and then walk us through also the Cloverfield decision to sell that movie and do you ever see to start moving to maybe work for higher model for films and then for Wade what's the normalized working capital change for you guys, it's I know how - is but when we think about modeling working capital for Viacom what do you think about kind of a normalized year?","-->","[Author:G]","Robert Bakish","Sure. So, let me flip that around on, let me take Cloverfield first and I'll throw it to Wade since he was on the ground in India and did that deal for the India piece. So, on Cloverfield, let me start by saying this was a unique situation that we thought was the right fit for the franchise. It allowed us to take advantage of an attractive audience and really create some pretty compelling economics.","So, while we continue, now also important that we're going to continue to focus the vast majority of our releases on traditional theaters and we see a great opportunity there to take share driven by our 19 Slate and beyond. But given our production capabilities and the landscape, we're going to continue to deliver broadly and creatively for opportunities to create additional value for Paramount. So again, I think Cloverfield is an interesting story, it's a bit of a one-off but it's an illustration of creative thinking and ways to create more value.","-->","[Author:G]","Wade Davis","So, in terms of Viacom18 venture this is something that we're, this is a business we're incredibly proud of, it's been a huge success, it kind of bare us reminding people that little under a decade ago we formed this venture and had diminished revenue and pretty material losses. And today it's over $500 million of revenue and meaningfully profitable, it's one of the top three diversified media companies in India. It today has the number one Hindi language general entertainment channel but it's business is also span a bouquet of regional languages in channels, feature film business that's had a great deal of success in the last couple of quarters as well as enabled our business that's one of the leaders in the marketplace there. So, it's been a huge success story.","Now in terms of the transaction, we did this was really it was driven by the strategic desire to really take advantage of our partners' position in the marketplace and their affiliated Jio platform. The Jio platform is something that is really transformed the Indian market, media marketplace over the past year where it's gone from nothing to over a 160 million subscribers in just over a year and so by allowing our partner to take really kind of day-to-day operational control over this business it's going to facilitate a much deeper integration of our business into the Jio platform and we think drive a real inflection point against the already strong growth of the business.","-->","[Author:G]","And I think there's a couple of other points just worth for mining folks which is number one, this business was never a consolidated asset so the sale of 1% and giving day-to-day operating control to our partner isn't something that has any impact on our financial statements whatsoever. What does have an impact on our financial statements is the fact that we extended and enhanced our license agreement with Viacom18 and that's one of the thing that not only allows us to benefit from the top line growth of the business as we accomplished the strategic objectives that I just described but it also immediately has a material impact on Viacom International media networks financial performance and that's one of the things that fuel that's going to fuel the upside that Bob referenced in his announcement, immediately in 2018 and also beyond.","So, it's a great transaction, we're really excited about it, kind of well beyond a couple of billion-dollar value that it picked today and having sold only 1% we still retain the vast majority of our upside.","Quickly because we've got to wrap up in terms of working capital changes, so we do have some growth in working capital consumption this that's really driven by the ramp up in production for the 19-film slate, where we're moving from 10 films this year to 16 films next year. We're ramping Paramount TV production and then a lot of the investments that we're making to continue to fuel the flagship networks.","So, although we're going to see some cash tax upside from tax reform this year it's going to be more than offset by the growth in working capital changes. Going forward that's going to, you'll see that kind of lap itself and unwind so you'll see continue to see strong growth in operating free cash flow going forward beyond 2018.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks, Wade.","Robert Bakish","Okay.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise and after the. And after the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to the presenters.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.","I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements it involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now, I will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm pleased to update you on our progress to grow Viacom and position it for the future. When you look at what we achieved in Q3, and our momentum in Q4. I think you will clearly see that the Viacom turnaround is delivering demonstrable and measurable results. And you will also see how quickly we are evolving to be much more than a U.S. Pay-TV network company. In fact, through this combination of turnaround and evolution, we're setting Viacom up for success as a truly multi-platform, global brand and IP-driven entertainment company.","Before I take you through a whole set of facts supporting this statement, let me first touch on some high level financials. Q3 represents our second consecutive quarter of adjusted diluted EPS growth and year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS is up 4%. Underlying that, we are reporting compelling improvements in domestic affiliate sales and worldwide ancillary revenues and strong profitability improvement at Paramount.","Looking to the September quarter, we now project strong adjusted OI growth and double-digit growth in EPS. Wade will take you through the numbers in detail. But before he does, let\u2019s focus on our operations where we\u2019ve continued to execute on both the turnaround and the evolution of this company. ","As I speak to this, I\u2019d encourage you to refer to our earnings presentation on our website, which tracks the discussion. I\u2019ll start with four key areas that were clearly challenged when this management team took over. Notably U.S. distribution, the audience performance of our networks, the trajectory of U.S. ad sales and the state of Paramount Pictures. And in each, I\u2019ll highlight just how dramatically the picture has changed for the better. ","First, our domestic affiliate business. A critical area that was considered a significant uncertainty 18 months ago, but now is a key turnaround story. By rebuilding and expanding our relationships with distribution partners, we closed major renewals, secured incremental carriage and broaden the scope of our partnerships to include advanced advertising and co-production deal. At the same time, we laid the groundwork for new areas of growth, including most recently securing carriage in the AT&T Watch entertainment only mobile bundle. We also participated in a funding round that ensures Pylo, [ph] an entertainment only OTT skinny bundle has the resources to drive its next leg of growth.","Importantly, we also see improvement in Viacom Pay TV subscriber trends, with our sub declines now moderating to the mid-1% range. This driven by the full return of Viacom Networks to Charter and Suddenlink and continued vMVPD growth. All of these efforts delivered sequential domestic affiliate revenue improvement throughout fiscal 2018, including in Q3 and we now anticipate domestic affiliate revenue growth of 1% in Q4. Compelling evidence of just how far our turnaround has come in this critical area.","The second area of turnaround is viewership on our domestic media networks. Here we have another strong story of continued improvement. In fact, Viacom flagship brands have now produced five straight quarters of year-over-year share growth, with particular strength at MTV, BET, and Comedy Central. 18 months ago, MTV was deemed by many, to be a network in decline and at risk of becoming culturally irrelevant.","Well times have changed, if you haven\u2019t been following this channel closely, here are a few key facts. Since last summer, the network has had four consecutive quarters of year-over-year primetime ratings growth, its best streak in seven years. While dramatically increasing its digital consumption.","In fact, in Q3, MTV is the fastest growing network in Prime, across cable and broadcast, in its 18 to 34 target demo. And in 2018, it has launched 5 of the top 10 unscripted cable series with a mix of franchise IP, like Jersey Shore, International IP, like X on the Beach and new IP, like Siesta Key and Floribama Shore. Ad VH1, and we have 9 out of the top 10 unscripted series on cable this year. and it\u2019s the top nine. All are reducing costs by an average of 30% per episode.","As you can see, there is depth and breadth to their success, and based on the slate that\u2019s coming for 2019, the team is truly just getting started. BET, also continues to deliver. Cable\u2019s number one destination for black entertainment and culture, has now growing share and ratings by double-digit year-over-year in three of the four quarters, including this last one. Its highest rated Q3, since 2014.","At the Comedy Central, here too the story is strong. Q3 saw the network\u2019s largest year-over-year prime time ratings increases since fiscal 2014. And Comedy just closed out and even bigger July, growing double-digits in both total day and prime time, driven by continued gains among women 18 to 49, a key component of its go forward strategy to broaden the network. And we are building on strength outside the U.S. too. Where our international networks business continues to perform and is expected to deliver a record earnings year.","In particular, we have had success programming our largest free to air broadcast networks overseas. Telefe in Argentina and Channel 5 in the UK. For example, in Argentina and [indiscernible] in the UK, number one broadcast network, which has four hit shows that have an audience share of over 45%. That said, we do have rating softness in Nickelodeon and Paramount Network in the U.S. that has slowed our return to growth in domestic ad revenue.","But we have made a series of changes, including with Nick management and put strategies in place to address those challenges. And the early signs are encouraging. At Nick, we were in the late stages of a thorough search for new permanent leadership, but we have not been waiting to act, our inter management team has been aggressively implementing change, while simultaneously working on a new go forward plan. And their work is already starting to produce results.","In fact, Nickelodeon has reduced its ratings declines so far in the fourth quarter, with ratings improving from minus 20 plus, to minus 12 and minus 2 over the last two weeks. And Nick recently delivered its highest total day weekly rating in over six months. This is a function of a series of scheduling changes, as well as new programming like Double Dare, which debut as the most viewed kid series this year.","As for Paramount Network, its growth will come as its programming slate builds, and the good news is our originals are working. The channel\u2019s most recent scripted series Yellowstone, delivered on a very high expectations, with the latest episode delivering the highest Live+3 rating on people 18 to 49 to-date. The show is averaging nearly 4.4 million viewers in Live+3 and is now the year\u2019s most watched scripted series on cable after the Walking Dead.","Moving to ad sales. As I mentioned, some rating softness prevented sequential improvement in the quarter, but very importantly, in Q3, we continue to set the foundation for growing and evolving this area of our business. The stabilization in Nick\u2019s ratings that we have recently seen will benefit ad sales. But the bigger point is the strength of the upfront. We drove our strongest upfront pricing in five years, with mid to high single-digit growth across all our cable networks, reflecting the improved strength of our brands and greater share of viewership across our portfolio.","Beyond linear pricing, the upfront also reflected the power and demand for our Advanced Marketing Solutions portfolio. As a reminder, AMS includes our branded content, advanced advertising and experiential offerings. In Q3, our AMS portfolio delivered revenue growth of 33% year-over-year. As a result of our continued progress, we remain on track to deliver AMS revenue of approximately $300 million in the full year setting up return to overall ad sales growth in 2019.","Lastly on AMS, I'm pleased to announce that Fox has agreed to license the powerful data science platform behind Viacom Vantage, our ad targeting product. Fox, will be the first media partner to use the Vantage editing to power its linear optimization service across its networks. This is a powerful validation of our leadership in the space as we work to secure additional licensing partnerships with publishers, we're excited about potential of this new business to accelerate the ecosystem and evolve into an incremental revenue stream.","Fourth in the turnaround story is Paramount Pictures, another area which much like MTV many had written off, but where we're now seeing a very different picture. The resurgence of Paramount is evident in its continuing box office success, thriving TV production business and now six straight quarters of OI improvement. As a reminder our hierarchical release strategy is twofold, make targeted films for somebody or broad films for everybody with price points to match. That strategy is paying off as illustrated by our three most recent hits.","Our more targeted releases of A Quiet Place and Book Club together saw a domestic box office of over $250 million at a combined production and acquisition cost of $30 million. The pair clearly demonstrates the strength in the new management team, their ability to make and market great movies and to creatively and efficiently manage distribution and costs.","Of course, the latest broad hit is Mission Impossible: Fallout, which had the most successful opening of the franchise and is a global blockbuster by every measure. Coming out of the second weekend of its run, the film has generated already just short of $330 million at the global box office, with many key markets including China still to come. And we're very excited about the pipeline. Up next this fall is Nobody's Fool starring Tiffany Haddish. This is Tyler Perry's first feature for BET and Paramount Players under our cross-house deal.","In all, Paramount's fiscal 2019 slate will nearly double the number of worldwide theatrical releases compared to 2018 and consistent with the flagship strategy we unveiled last year it includes at least five films from Paramount Players that will bring our TV brand for life on the big screen.","And speaking of TV. Paramount TV continues its great run. In just a few years, Paramount TV has grown revenues from zero to more than $400 million expected in fiscal 2018. While we recently had made a management change, we have a strong senior team and a deep bench in place to continue our momentum. With seasonal news ordered for hits like 13 Reasons Why and The Alienist and the upcoming Jack Ryan series even before it airs, along with an increasing number of new show pickups like Catch-22 For Who and Maniac for Netflix, this business will grow substantially in 2019. ","Step back, and I think you can see the Paramount turnaround is firing on all cylinders. And know that as in Q3, the business is expected to be profitable in Q4. And that Paramount is on track to deliver well over $200 million in OI improvement for the full year. But in today's media marketplace, a turnaround is not enough. Viacom was also evolved to access new opportunities and new revenue streams. This is at the core of our strategy. And here too we are seeing signs of success.","To that end, let me take you through three really exciting opportunity areas, that we are in the early stages of unlocking. First, Digital this is really a multi-faceted area, which starts with the hard work at Viacom Digital Studios. Viacom's total digital video streams have grown sequentially every quarter and are now at $7 billion across O&O and social platforms. This is 3 times what they were in Q3 of 2016. By the way, we also delivered a 104% increase in watch time year-over-year in the quarter. And all of this is before we see the full impact of an additional 600 hours of new original digital content we\u2019ve already commissioned and before the impact of the recent acquisition of awesomeness, a leading digital first destination for original programming serving global Gen-Z audiences.","This acquisition enhances our footprint across leading in digital and social platforms and complements our studio production efforts. A growing area of opportunity we\u2019re focused on that I\u2019ll talk more about in a moment. All of this digital activity is key of feeding our audience consumption and Advanced Marketing Solutions offerings. At the same time, we continue to make progress establishing our presence on next generation distribution platforms.","Beyond the domestic affiliate area, we continue to expand our footprint Internationally through partnerships with OTT and Mobile providers. Just last month for example we completed a deal that will bring Nick Japan and Japan MTV Mix on to Amazon Prime Video channels, a platform that allows our International content to reach incremental audiences in Japan. We also expect to close two additional deals with mobile carriers in Europe, which will be announced shortly and we continue to talk to U.S. mobile providers about a range of opportunities.","On the direct-to-consumer front, we\u2019re taking a multi-dimensional approach to ensure that we\u2019re making the most out of our assets and capabilities and to quickly capture opportunities in the evolving ecosystem.","The first is through a move towards launching a new D2C platform, which we\u2019ve referenced previously. At the same time we\u2019re pursuing a B2B2C strategy creating targeted D2C products that are also distributed through our partners. Nickelodeon\u2019s Noggin is a great example. Since its launch on Amazon in May, we\u2019ve seen rapid subscriber growth for the preschool programming product, demonstrating the continued consumer demand for our category defining brands and content.","The last element of our D2C strategy is our cross portfolio Viacom Studio Production initiative. This significantly expanded global episodic content production business is the second opportunity area I want to highlight. To be clear, this isn\u2019t about the wholesale licensing of our library product to SVOD players. This is about new first run content for SVOD platforms and other third parties. Paramount TV\u2019s rapid revenue growth is clear evidence of the insatiable demand for premium episodic video content. But we now see a much larger opportunity and has set our sight on building a studio production into $1 billion business by 2020.","That\u2019s why we\u2019ve now established studio production units at Nickelodeon, MTV and Viacom International Media Networks. Comedy Central and BET will be launching shortly. The mandate for these entities is to create new original content for third party customers leveraging existing and new IP and it is already beginning to happen. In June we announced that Nickelodeon is licensing the animated series Pinky Malinky to NetFlix in a multi-year deal for 59 new episodes.","At the same time MTV Studios will capitalize on one of the TV industry\u2019s largest libraries of youth focused and music related IP in the world that up until now has been largely untapped. But it\u2019s not just in the U.S. launched in May Viacom International Studios unites the extensive production capabilities of Telefe and our comedy brand Porta dos Fundos in Brazil, with Viacom\u2019s Latin American brands and production capabilities. This creates a multi-lingual machine that accelerates our positioning as a leading global content creator and distributor of Spanish and Portuguese language content in U.S., Latin America and beyond.","Here we have already entered into deals with NetFlix, Amazon, Telemundo and Fox among others, with a long list of prospects at various stages of development in the pipeline. As we evolve our business events and experiential are a third area of focus. We know our brands connect with consumers in the live space and we\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a business there.","Millions of people around the world attended a total of 65 Viacom events in the first three quarters of 2018. In June alone we held Viacom\u2019s first VidCon and Nickelodeon\u2019s first Slimefest in the U.S. Another huge BET experience our second annual Comedy Central Clusterfest and outside of the U.S. we had a range of events including our 16th Isle of MTV in Malta.","In the quarter event activity was a major driver of our double-digit growth in ancillary revenue. And we\u2019re very excited about the partnership Bellator, form with streaming service DAZN in the quarter. The multi-year nine-figure distribution deal will bring 20% more live events to global audiences in 2019. More than doubling Bellator revenue and making it profitable.","With that, let me hand it off to Wade, for a deeper discussion on how our financial results underscore our turnaround efforts and our continued progress moving forward.","Wade Davis ","Thanks, Bob. As Bob mentioned, our progress in the June quarter translated to improvements in a number of key areas, including adjusted EPS, domestic affiliate revenue, Advanced Marketing Solutions revenue, Paramount profitability and our credit outlook. In aggregate, this translated to a strong third quarter and sets us up for an even stronger quarter in September.","Now moving to the segment results, I\u2019ll start with Paramount, which is on slide 13 of our earnings presentation. The new management team is delivering on its turnaround, and has made progress including significantly improving profitability in the quarter. For the quarter, the studio generated adjusted operating profit of $44 million, which was up $35 million year-over-year. The improvement was driven by the performance of A Quiet Place and Book Club as compared to the prior year releases, as well as the strength of the TV production business.","Filmed Entertainment total revenues declined 9% compared to last year, driven by the comparison to last year\u2019s theatrical release of Transformers: The Last Night and fewer home entertainment titles released in the quarter. The decline was partially offset by licensing revenues, which was up a strong 35% driven by the continued success of the TV production business. ","Given the success of Mission Impossible - Fallout, which was released on July 27th, we expect September quarter to be the third consecutive quarter of profitability for Paramount. Year-to-date, Filmed Entertainment, adjusted operating income has improved by $160 million versus the prior year and is on track to deliver well over $200 million of improvement for the full year. ","Now turning to Media Networks, on slide 14. In the quarter, we saw a continued sequential improvement in domestic affiliate revenue, strong growth in AMS revenue and in our adjacent businesses, including CP, [indiscernible] and Live. Worldwide Media Networks revenue for the quarter were down 2% to $2.5 billion, driven by the declines in domestic advertising and worldwide SVOD license. This decline was partially offset by the growth in worldwide ancillary revenues and worldwide linear affiliate revenues. ","Adjusted operating income declined 8%, driven by the decrease in revenue, investments in original programming and costs related to growth initiatives, which were partially offset by the benefits from our cost transformation. Domestic advertising revenues declined 3%, which was flat sequentially, due to lower linear impression, partially offset by higher pricing and strong growth in our AMS business.","AMS continues to be a source of strength for us and is an increasingly important part of our business, with revenue up 33% in the quarter. We\u2019re on track to deliver AMS revenue of approximately $300 million as previously guided, and we anticipate continued momentum in AMS in fiscal 2019. ","As Bob mentioned, we are seeing lower linear impressions driven by Nick and Paramount network ratings, as a result for the September quarter, we anticipate domestic add sales growth similar to the June quarter. However, we are optimistic for a return to growth in 2019 given our strong upfront, continued strong scatter pricing, our momentum in AMS and the actions that we\u2019re taking at Nick, which are showing early signs of improvement.","Now moving to domestic affiliate revenue. The 3% year-over-year decrease in revenue was ahead of our guidance and 100 basis points sequential improvement from the prior quarter. The sequential improvement in the quarter reflects the lapping of rate resets from the prior year, improving sub-trends including the reinstated carriage and charter, continued strong vMVPD growth, as well as contractual rate increases. Excluding library licensing to SVOD, linear revenue year-over-year was flat for the first time in five quarters, which is a strong reflection of our distribution strategy delivering results.","Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we now expect to deliver better performance than previously guided, with domestic affiliate revenue returning to growth, driven by the lapping of rate resets, as well as the benefit from our reinstated carriage in charter and Suddenlink. For fiscal 2019,we continue to expect growth in domestic affiliate revenues helped by rate escalators, sustained vMVPD growth, including the launch of new vMVPD services from traditional distributors and revenue from mobile.","Now turning to International Media Networks on slide 15. Revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange headwind particularly in Argentina, and the timing of SVOD licensing. International affiliate revenues decreased 2% driven by the timing of SVOD revenue, which is now expected to benefit the September quarter. for the full year, we continue to expect double-digit growth in international affiliate revenue.","International advertising revenues declined 4%, driven by a 5 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Argentina\u2019s peso devalued by 45% in the quarter weighing on Telefe\u2019s reported results. Excluding foreign exchange, Telefe\u2019s advertising revenue grew 25%. On an organic basis, international ad sales were up 1%, which was comparable to the March quarter. Organic results were impacted by softening and rating share in the UK. For the September quarter given continued negative currency impacts we accept reported international advertising growth to be similar to the June quarter.","From a bottom line perspective, our costs are largely naturally hedged. So we continue to expect a record year for international profitability. As we look to 2019, we anticipate continued growth in International Media Networks across all lines. We also see a rapidly growing global studio production initiative benefiting from a cost perspective, given the currency devaluation in Argentina.","Finally, we continue to make progress, diversifying our business into adjacent revenues. This is reflected in our worldwide ancillary revenues, which were up 17% in the quarter, with domestic revenues up 31% and international revenues up 2%. The growth in worldwide ancillary revenue was driven by growth in live events and consumer products revenues.","Turning to Media Networks expenses, we continue to invest in our content and growth initiatives, while transforming our cost base to drive efficiencies in SG&A. In the June quarter programming expense increased 2%, reflecting our continued investment in original programming. Distribution and other expenses grew 6%, primarily driven cost related to our growth initiatives. SG&A expense decreased by 2% in the quarter and included a 3 percentage point benefit related to the savings from our cost transformation.","For the full year, we now expect programming expense to be flat versus the prior year, as we invest in original programming at our flagship networks, while benefiting from the mix shift to unscripted programming and leveraging our content globally. In terms of costs base reinvention we\u2019re on track with fiscal year 2018 savings of over $100 million and continue to expect to achieve more than $300 million in run rate savings in 2019 and beyond. And for these savings to largely drop to the bottom line.","As previously guided, we took a $15 million charge in the quarter and anticipate taking a charge of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter, principally related to the third party professional fees.","Turning to taxes and free cash flow, the year-to-date adjustment effective tax rate was 24% as we continue to benefit from the new tax legislation. For the full year, we now expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 24%, which compares to 30% last year.","Turning to cash flow, the components of which were broken out on slide 16 of the earnings presentation. Year-to-date we generated $895 million of operating free cash flow, which is up from $548 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by lower cash taxes related to domestic tax reform and lower cash interest due to our delevering actions.","As Bob mentioned, Paramount\u2019s 2019 slate will nearly double the number of releases as compared to the 2018 slate. This working capital impact is largely being incurred this year. Despite this we anticipate generating free cash flow in fiscal 2018 in line with last year.","Turning to the balance sheet, as we\u2019ve said complete took over, one of our key initiatives is then to delever and strengthen our balance sheet. We took swift and deliberate actions over the past 18 months from both an operational and financial perspective to achieve that objective, including the reduction of our gross debt by approximately $3 billion. And in early July S&P reaffirmed our investment grade status and removed us from negative credit watch, recognizing our operating progress and the steps we took to delever.","In terms of debt, at quarter-end we had $10.1 billion of total debt outstanding and cash of $929 million. Our debt was principally fixed rate with a weighted average cost of just under 5%. If you take into consideration, the equity credit we received from S&P and Fitch on our hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter-end was $9.4 billion. We plan to continue to pursue opportunities to delever, including using excess free cash flow to redeem debt.","Turning to our consolidated results on slide 17. While total revenues and adjusted operating income declined in the quarter. The composition of the underlying drivers provides the window into why we're optimistic about our Q2 growth. In Media Networks, AMS continues to deliver strong double-digit growth and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to overall domestic ad sales. Our domestic affiliate revenue trajectories improved in the past two quarters and will now returned to growth in the September quarter, marking the first time since the June quarter of 2017.","And on the cost side, we're managing SG&A lower as we drive operational efficiency throughout the organization, while focusing our investments on regional content and other growth initiatives that will drive future top and bottom-line results.","On the studio side, while the decline in the international theatrical revenues and worldwide home video revenues reduced overall revenue performance in the quarter, this was due to the mix and number of titles in release. While revenues were lower year-over-year, our current quarter releases were more profitable than the prior year's releases, which is indicative of the types of films that the new management team is developing. Films aimed at either a broad or targeted audience, but with a financial profile of the match.","And in a short period of time, Paramount TV has become a meaningful contributor to the top and bottom-line. We expect to continue to realize the benefits of this momentum in 2019 as we make progress towards our goal of returning the studio to historical levels of full year profitability.","So we're extremely optimistic as we look ahead. The financial impact of the turnaround will be more significant in the September quarter as we anticipate year-over-year growth in total company revenue, adjusted operating income and mid to high-teens growth in adjusted diluted EPS.","With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Bob to wrap up.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Wade. So to recap, seven quarters in we've stabilized and turned around four critical parts of the business that were under serious pressure 18 months ago. Our domestic affiliate business, audience viewership, our path to domestic ad sales growth and of course Paramount Pictures. ","As we executed on all of this, we strengthened our financial position, where operating and financial momentum has improved our credit profile. But it's just the beginning, Viacom is a story of a company broadening its participation in the media landscape. We see that in the growth of our digital footprint. In the early success of our expanded studio production business and in our growing live events and adjacent businesses. Taken together, we delivered EPS growth in the quarter and are on track to deliver accelerated EPS growth in Q4.","So, it is an exciting time at Viacom, and we remain focused on accelerating this momentum as we close out the year and grow the company for the future.","Thank you for joining us today. And now we look forward to taking your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from line Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. ","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions. When you think about the success that you had in the upfront in terms of the domestic advertising outlook. I guess, how -- when should we see sort of notable improvement? I think you suggest better growth in 2019. I was just wondering how much if at all you'd make goods from Nick or Paramount that may offset some of that strong pricing gains you've gotten?","And my second question is just sort of follow-up on, I think, Wade's comments about the positive affiliate growth in fiscal Q4. Any SVOD sales in there or is that sort of 1% growth kind of a good run rate when we look out -- further out? ","Robert Bakish","Yes, Alexia, let's start with your question on the upfront -- let me start by reiterating that we're very happy with this upfront. Look, as I said in our last call, our strategy was the scarcity to drive aggressive pricing and packaging, including AMS and that's exactly what we did. We drove the strongest price increases in five years with as we said CPM growth in the mid to high single-digits.","And look, this is critically important to setting us up for growth in a supply constrained world. And this pricing is more than offsetting the current rate of universe declines. And if I compare that to our upfront last year that was not the case.","On volume, we were down low single-digits, but this was by design, we aggressively tiered our lower paying business, because we wanted to ensure we have inventory to monetizing scatter. The scarcity we're seeing will create a seller's market and scatter premiums will elevate the already strong upload pricing. ","Importantly, we also saw excellent demand for our AMS portfolio, that allowed for effective packaging, with other kinds of inventory. And part -- and as part of our growing position as solution providers. ","So all this is a really excellent foundation for ad sales growth, as we transition to fiscal 2019. And the last thing I would say because you talked about Nick specifically in the upfront. Importantly, we talked about mid high single-digit CPM growth across all the networks. But if you look at Nickelodeon, in particular, in the hard nine which is -- where the bulk of the money is, there we had strong double-digit CPM increases.","So very well positioned to monetize Nickelodeon. Particularly, as we start to see these early signs of a rating rebound. And then finally related to that your questions of ADUs, we'll be well positioned to burn the accumulation -- any accumulation off. So, feel good about this upfront as a critical step in our transition.","Wade do you want to take the affiliate one?","Wade Davis","Well, actually just on the ADU point, Alexia it is just a little bit more specifics there. So in the aggregate, our ADUs are actually down significantly Nick was the only place that we incurred any sort of growth in ADUs and even that was only up less than $10 million. With respect to affiliate, can you repeat your question, Alexia?","Alexia Quadrani","The question was just on your guide for the 1% domestic affiliate growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. Is that a good run rate going forward longer term or is there some SVOD sales or some other sales that are bumping up that number for Q4?","Wade Davis","Well, SVOD as we said was a headwind for us in this quarter, both domestically and internationally. When you think about the guide and the return to growth, we\u2019re not yet going to provide any detail with respect to 2019 overall other than to say that we\u2019re confident in overall affiliate growth for the full year. We are returning to a place where pricing, contractual pricing increases are more than offsetting subscriber declines, the benefit from Charter and Suddenlink reinstatement came online in this quarter. It\u2019s also going to impact to a lesser extent next quarter, we\u2019re continuing to see strong virtual MVPD contribution both from a volume and pricing standpoint.","And then obviously in the virtual MVPD line that\u2019s a good contributor to our AMS business as much of the virtual MVPD subscribers carry addressable units with them for us. And so that\u2019s contributing to the addressable AMS inventory volume. So we\u2019re confident about continued growth in domestic affiliate going into 2019.","Alexia Quadrani","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thanks. Good morning. One for Bob and one for Wade. Bob, you talked about a goal of $1 billion, I think TV production, just want to confirm is that across Paramount and the Media Networks lead up to 2020 target. And maybe you could just help us think about sort of the strategy around that and how you think through your confidence level in reaching those type growth rates over the next couple of years?","And then Wade, I think you\u2019re saying mid to high-teens adjusted EPS growth for 2019, I just wanted to understand what are you assuming for U.S. advertising growth at Media Nets underpinning that assumption just understanding sort of the strong upfront against the some of the ratings trajectory issues?","Robert Bakish","Sure Ben, so on the studio side $1 billion 2020 number is Viacom so that\u2019s Media Networks plus Paramount and that\u2019s global. And the studio initiative is really driven by a confluence of things. First, the large and growing demand from third parties for quality episodic content worldwide, Viacom\u2019s ownership of broad and deep libraries of IP now that stuff both we\u2019ve developed and stuff that we\u2019ve sitting in the libraries waiting to be developed combined with our strong capabilities in content creation.","It\u2019s about a deal flow that we currently have with respect to talent and ideas that\u2019s larger than our owned and operating network can accommodate. And it\u2019s about this increasing opportunity to extend brand reach beyond Pay-TV, which is serving more consumers and growing awareness to drive other elements of the flagship strategy.","Again this initiative is about creating new first run content it\u2019s not about the wholesale licensing of library product to third parties. We are taking a page from the Paramount TV Playbook, which is mine the library for IP, leverage talent relationships in ecosystem, use a cost plus model not deficit financing. We view it as a way to extend the brands to other platforms and generate incremental revenues. These shows in addition to being a business on their own right can service as promotion for our brands because by far the fullest experience of our brands will continue to be in the Pay-TV space.","So we\u2019re convinced this is a great opportunity here again it\u2019s global you heard me talk about international in my remarks and we\u2019re convinced it\u2019s incremental.","Benjamin Swinburne","So you see this -- just to follow-up, you see this as really additive to the engagement trends across your kind of core business rather than something that you may be making trade-offs around monetizing on or off platform?","Robert Bakish","We see it as definitely incremental.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you.","Wade Davis","So Ben, with respect to your question around high-teens growth in Q4 in particular ad sales got on domestic. So first of all we\u2019re very proud of the accelerating EPS growth. It\u2019s actually driven by pretty much factors across our entire business in all geographies. U.S. domestic ad sales though as we said in our prepared remarks are going to be sequentially flat with Q3. ","Our biggest issue there is supply constraints as you saw in Q3 our actual revenue numbers significantly over indexed the decline in supply that\u2019s a dynamic that is going to continue and really is reflective of ad sales firing on all cylinders despite the supply constraints. And that performance we\u2019re going to take into 2019 and we\u2019re highly confident that 2019 on a full year basis is going to grow.","Bob, talked about the dynamics in the upfront where our pricing gains are now offsetting the current universe estimate declines. And then AMS, AMS is now at a position where given that we\u2019re on track for $300 million of revenue in Q4 it is really material and that business is going to continue to grow into 2019 continuing its growth rates in the 30% to 40% range. And given the fact that it\u2019s now at that level of materiality and contributing that level of growth. It\u2019s really changing the dynamics of our domestic ad sales business.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you for the clarification.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Can you give us a little bit more color on the International business there have been a focus in adding channels, will that continue to slow, but the growth in Telefe are you set up for margin expansion on top of the revenue growth. And can you also give us an update on India? And then separately Bob, how are you feeling about the roll out and opportunity for the entertainment pack to some for an update there? Thanks.","Robert Bakish","Sure, so on international we did see it slowdown a little this quarter, but that was overwhelmingly driven by currency and on the distribution side some SVOD timing. Before I peal it apart very important to note we continue to expect a record year for international revenue and profitability and we anticipate international continuing to be a growth engine for 2019 and beyond.","So, with respect to Argentina, we have free to air broadcaster down there. The 45% peso of devaluation was a material headwind, but important to note organically, the business performing very well, we continue to be number one on audience share, ad sales were up 25% on a constant currency basis. And we\u2019re in the very early stages of developing a retransmission consent driven affiliate revenue stream, enabled by some regulatory change down there.","And I mentioned the studio production initiative, a big hub for it is Argentina. And so now we\u2019re looking at what else we can move into there to really even get more benefit given the cost economics down there. So, Argentina again the peso is a bit of an issue, but we\u2019re very happy in general what we see as we step back.","You asked about India, as you know Viacom 18 is unconsolidated joint venture that we have with Reliance, where we\u2019re at 49%, they are at 51%. That business continues to perform and in fact continuing to expand in both the regional space, India is kind of like Europe multiple cultures and languages in there. And the national space i.e. the Hindi space and it\u2019s Voot products, which is its ad supported AVOD platform continues to perform and ramp and continue to benefit and probably increasingly benefit from our partner\u2019s ownership of GL.","Wade Davis","I\u2019d just like to add a couple of things on India. As you know, we did a transaction with our partner in which sold them 1% and that created movement from 50-50 to 49-51 that Bob referenced. So just a couple of things on that, first it\u2019s important to remind everybody, that that transaction even though was for a small percentage occurred at a multi-billion dollar value and that\u2019s something we continue to be somewhat frustrated doesn\u2019t really show up in the value of the overall company. ","And then secondly, I just like to point out that notwithstanding the value that that placed on business, the real motivation for that transaction was to more closely align the operational incentives of our Viacom 18 business with Reliance, who has really transform the broadband telecommunication infrastructure in India and they have -- since they have taken more direct operational control of that business. They have chartered a very clear definitive and aggressive path to take Viacom 18 to the number one media business in India.","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. ","Richard Greenfield","A couple of questions. The first just, I think Bob if I heard you right, and I may do my hearing check. But I think you said that you\u2019re going to license your advanced advertising data to Fox. Love to just have any idea of the size of that in terms of revenue to Viacom, or how to think about that. But more importantly, I think the advanced advertising business from Fox is actually being sold to Disney. So does that mean effectively within the next six to nine months that Disney will be licensing data from Viacom for targeting advertising.","And then two, a bigger picture question for you and Wade. You\u2019re doing well over $3 in earnings through the nine months, it looks like you\u2019re heading to well over $4 for the fiscal year. Calendar year will be higher that\u2019s with Paramount losing money, I know it\u2019s a long winded question, but with your stock under $29, is there any reason for Viacom to be a public company, I mean, why don\u2019t you and National Amusements find a third-party and figure out a way to go Private. Because it seems like there is a growing disconnect between the company\u2019s earnings power and the stock price. And just wonder how you think about the importance of being public?","Robert Bakish","Sure, Rich, so let\u2019s do it in reverse order. So, on the Viacom question, we think there is a clear and the module fact set that this company is making material progress in a whole set of areas and we summarize that in our remarks regarding Q3 and what we are seeing in Q4. At the same time we totally agree that the company is currently undervalued by the public marketplace. But we\u2019re not going to comment on any specific M&A relate to Viacom, we are focused on operating a Company and again continuing to move the ball down the field, any M&A including of the form that you\u2019re talking about is really a board question.","Wade Davis","Yes why don\u2019t I take Vantage question. So, I thought to take it a little bit in reverse order. So first on the Disney point, which is just a little bit of a detail. Our deal does specifically contemplate that transition, but the important thing to note is that we're not actually licensing data, this is a technology license. So we're licensing our Vantage targeting engine, which is software. And then there is a set of managed services agreements that relate to the ongoing operation of the customer segment creation and posting.","This is a really key development for our AMS business and this comes out of the significant investment that we started making in 2015 in the Advanced TV business. And then ultimately the evolution and creation of the OpenAP partnership, which we in partnership with Fox and Turner brought to life last year. And it's important to note that OpenAP continues to evolve significantly. So even though we launched it only between us, Fox and Turner in 2017. It now has grown to include NBCU and Univision with just the current members representing well over 50% of the GRP delivery in the U.S.","Fox is going to the first publisher to license the Vantage targeting engine, which we're really excited about. The structure of that deal as I said it's a software license and managed service agreement. There is a upfront license fee associated with the initial tech and implementation. And then there is a variable part of that that allows us to participate in the upside.","And then, it is also important that this is a new line item in our AMS business. And a significant opportunity for us to partner with other publishers on this. And we're in late-stage discussions with a number of other publishers and we're really excited about the possibility and upside for this business in 2019. ","Richard Greenfield","Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Michelson with Credit Suisse. ","Doug Michelson ","I guess for Bob and Wade, a couple of questions. The first phase of the turnaround for ratings at your networks was done pretty cost effectively. I think you've talked about the switch from script to don\u2019t script it. As you look forward to maintain the momentum and progress of MTV and others and revitalize Nick and invest in the Digital Studio. What's the right outlook for sort of programming cost growth? And a second question, you've talked about TV production quite a bit, and how it's growing substantially. If you haven't said it, where would you expect margins to shake out at that TV production business once it\u2019s fully scaled for Paramount? Thanks.","Robert Bakish","Yes, so on the production business, that is a double-digit margin business. And we would fully anticipate getting there pretty quickly. Again, we are not doing this in a kind of deficit financing model, we're doing this in a cost plus model, which has a bunch of appeals certainly from a capital standpoint and has pretty predictable margin characteristics. ","As far as the Media Networks programming side. We've been very focused on -- as part of the flagship strategy that was clearly really about prioritization and making sure that we were spending our money in the places where we had the best short and long-term position was also about mix. We talked about we entered into unscripted as an example of that. And both of those things are clearly working. And we anticipate continuing to move in that direction. Our programming growth was probably in the 2% range this quarter or Q3. On a long-term basis it's going to be higher than that. We\u2019re probably more in the mid-single digits. But that's how we see it playing out.","Doug Michelson ","If I can just ask Wade a question. On the balance sheet, when is the balance sheet refresh sort of complete and you can be more aggressive deploying free cash flow in otherwise?","Wade Davis","So in the short-term, we have said that we're going to continue to use free cash flow to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. We -- and importantly, I mean, if embedded in your question is are we going to start buying back shares. We don't foresee any share buybacks in the foreseeable future. You're right, this is a business that has tremendous free cash flow that creates value for shareholders and also creates significant opportunities for us.","As the balance sheet continue to strengthen, we're going to shift the incremental free cash flow towards higher levels of investment in the business. First in the organic opportunities that we see and that we've been delivering on. And then second on targeted M&A that you've seen us engage in where we think we can both accelerate the clearly articulated strategic plan that we have, as well as drive kind of immediately attractive risk adjusted returns from a financial point of view.","Doug Michelson ","Thank you, both. ","Robert Bakish","Operator, we'll take our last question. ","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Moffett Nathanson. ","Michael Nathanson","Hey guys, can you hear me. So I have two questions, thanks. One for Wade, and one for Bob. Wade, if you turn to your cash flow on slide 16, I'm just trying to get a better handle of what's the right way to think about your cash tax payments normalize? And then working capital, I know this year is a build to Paramount, but in kind of a normal steady state cycle, what's the right way to think about working capital and cash flow?","And then for Bob, I know international affiliate has been bouncing around due to SVOD, currency Telefe, but can you give us a sense of at a linear side what's the right way think about the normalized affiliate fee growth for the international business maybe ex-currency and the SVOD business?","Wade Davis","Sure, so quickly on cash flow. So the dynamics currently are really a fairly significant upside around cash taxes and that\u2019s both function of domestic tax reform and rate as well as some significant tax planning that's been done by our tax department that's given us some real benefits with respect to domestic and international.","Working capital is obviously up, as we've importantly absorbed the nearly doubling of the Paramount's film slate 2018 to 2019. Media Networks to working capital is relatively stable, and what you're going in to the next year is you are going to see positive working capital trends and you'll see cash taxes normalize. So that's really the dynamics that you should think about from a free cash flow standpoint.","Robert Bakish","Yes. And on the affiliate side, internationally it\u2019s a function as you said of SVOD. You strip that out constant currency and again it varies depending on launch activity as well. But I think you should think about that as mid-singles revenue growth envelope. And the reason you get that is, there was a lot of noise, but our services are still in significant demand.","I recently was with the CEO of [indiscernible], which I know is a U.S. operator. But in that conversation, he told me that the re-addition of Viacom services to Suddenlink has been a significant positive to their business. And the performance of the video bundle in particular where weekly viewership minutes are up over 10% since we were added. And bundle video selling rates are also up over 10%.","So, that continues to speak to the importance of Viacom services to viewers in the U.S. and beyond. It speaks to what the great work that we\u2019re doing at MTV, where those ratings are up dramatically. I mean, heading 9, the top 9 unscripted shows on television is no mean feat. So that stuff is resonating. And that\u2019s why, as we look to the future, we had to manage to the implementation of a new affiliate strategy, where we broadened, what we were doing to include advanced advertising and co-production as we simultaneously got a whole bunch of our brands healthier. ","And as we did all that, you\u2019re seeing sequential improvement in affiliate sales in fiscal 2018, including in Q3, you\u2019re going to see a return to growth in Q4. And there are a lot of positives going on here. And I think it\u2019s worth noting that, the decline in the Viacom stock price as I look at charts over the last two years was fundamentally correlated to negative news in affiliate in general and with respect to us.","And what you were seeing here is us coming out the other side of that through strategy, through relationships, through product. And so, yes, we do project international affiliate growth in the mid-singles. We project U.S. affiliate growth in the fourth quarter and in 2019 and we\u2019re feeling pretty good about that.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for our June quarter. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our CFO. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.","I want to refer you to Page #2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.","Sumner M. Redstone","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Viacom continues to build its leading brand and build outstanding value for its shareholders. As our industry continues to evolve, our management team is keeping right on position for even greater success.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Viacom's CEO, my great, great friend, the wisest man I have ever known, Philippe Dauman.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you very much, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the third quarter of Viacom's 2014 fiscal year. Viacom is in great shape. Audiences are enjoying our programming in more ways than ever across screens and around the world. Paramount Pictures delivered the global mega hit of the summer in Transformers: Age of Extinction, the highest-grossing film of all time in China, and we continue to return significant capital to our shareholders.","Let's look at a snapshot of our financial performance for the quarter. Tom and Wade will go into greater depth in a moment. Revenues decreased 7% to $3.42 billion, reflecting revenue declines in Filmed Entertainment, partially offset by increases in Media Networks. Operating income rose slightly to $1.09 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations decreased to $618 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 10% to $1.42.","As always, we maintain a strong balance sheet, allowing us to invest consistently in content across platforms and capture growth opportunities worldwide. And as I mentioned, we remain steadfast in our commitment to returning substantial capital to our shareholders. In the June quarter, we repurchased $850 million in stock under our ongoing stock repurchase program. In the current quarter, we plan to repurchase another $850 million in stock, and expect our buyback for the September-ending fiscal year to total $3.4 billion. Including dividends, we will have returned nearly $4 billion in capital to our shareholders by the close of fiscal 2014.","Speaking of growth opportunities, a quick update on our acquisition of Channel 5 in the U.K. We're well along in the regulatory process, and we expect the transaction to close by the end of this quarter. In the meantime, we continue to identify content and marketing synergies between Channel 5 and our current network portfolio. As we've said, this acquisition is a fantastic opportunity for us to grow our business in the strong U.K. market with a great free-to-air asset. We're looking forward to our bright future with Channel 5.","Returning to our results. At our Media Networks, domestic advertising revenue increased 1%, and worldwide advertising increased 2% in the June quarter. In the current quarter, which has a difficult comp against double-digit growth last fiscal Q4, we expect domestic advertising to grow low-single digits.","It's been widely reported that this year's Upfront selling season was relatively soft, with most networks seeing decreases in volume as a few major advertisers held back dollars. While the market generally was indeed challenging, our Media Networks outperformed, and we grew volume in the low to mid-single digits over last year. This positions us very well for next year. This is a credit to the strength and vibrancy of our brands and our ability to create value for our marketing partners in new, innovative ways. Our new Viacom Velocity Integrated Marketing unit has driven tremendous business for us this year as it develops more and more custom campaigns and content for advertisers and connects advertisers to our huge social media footprint and wealth of data and insights on our audiences. These programs will only grow in importance.","The recent BET Experience is another great example of how we're creating new opportunities to work with advertisers. In its second year, BET nearly tripled the number of sponsors for the LA-based festival and substantially grew advertising revenue.","On the distribution side, total affiliate revenue was flat in the quarter, largely due to the lapping of our Amazon Prime deal in the comparable quarter fiscal 2013. Domestic affiliate revenue for traditional distribution grew in the low-double digits. With a strong fourth fiscal quarter, we continue to expect affiliate revenue to grow in the high-single to low-double digits for the full fiscal year.","In the quarter, we struck a number of distribution deals reflecting the breadth of opportunities at hand for us to serve audiences and monetize content. As we've mentioned, we opened the quarter with a successful renewal of our agreement with the National Cable Television Cooperative, extending our partnership with nearly 800 cable operators and 4.8 million subscribers nationwide. We also struck an agreement with Google Play, covering a wide swath of library content from across our brands. We completed a great agreement with Hulu, renewing our existing deal and bringing the entire library of South Park to the streaming service. Finally, in the current quarter, we secured distribution for EPIX on AT&T U-verse, growing the footprint of the network to nearly 50 million homes nationwide.","In the June quarter, many networks across television experienced rating softness, including a number of our own. Even in this landscape and amidst heavy competition from sports programming, we did have 2 of the strongest stories in cable in the quarter.","SPIKE marked its fourth straight quarter of year-over-year ratings growth with Adults 18-49 with increases in every key daypart. In fact, SPIKE achieved the largest year-over-year net ratings gains of any non-sports cable network in the demo. Bar Rescue led the way for the network. Remarkably, the show recorded its highest-rated cycle yet in this, its third season, establishing itself as appointment viewing even among a very crowded Sunday night field. Ink Master also continued to perform well, along with newcomers Catch A Contractor and Hungry Investors.","VH1 had the second-largest year-over-year net ratings gain of any non-sports cable network in the demo, right behind SPIKE. The network's hit series Hit The Floor and Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta were key drivers of that growth. More recently, VH1 successfully launched a new Thursday primetime lineup, highlighted by the solid performance of Candidly Nicole and the network's complex meditation on romance, vulnerability and human connection in the modern age, Dating Naked.","As we move forward, we're consistently investing in original content, and bringing more and more new programming to air. Nickelodeon has a torrent of new programming for us coming, including 9 new shows launching from the current quarter through the first quarter of calendar 2015, including the premiere of Dora and Friends this month and new live action series Henry Danger and Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn in September.","In the period through the critical back-to-school and Hard Eight selling seasons, Nickelodeon has 12 straight weeks of premieres, many of which are returning hit series that powered the network to substantial gains last fall, including Sanjay and Craig, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.","Nickelodeon also launched a new tentpole in the current quarter with the solid debut of the Kids' Choice Sports awards, which delivered on our expectations and BBSP's in total viewership. Advertisers loved it, too, with a number of the inaugural, as well as new sponsors, already committing to next year's show.","MTV just debuted its highly anticipated, scripted drama, Finding Carter, which is currently cable's #1 new series of the year with teens and the network's best scripted launch in more than 2 years. Carter is one of the many MTV shows that benefit remarkably from nonlinear viewing. Last week, the show saw a 104% lift in live-plus-3 playback.","Finding Carter joins the recently renewed Faking It in MTV's lineup of new scripted originals this year, along with the forthcoming Happyland. In addition, MTV has new episodes of hit series, including Teen Wolf, Teen Mom 2 and Ridiculousness this quarter. And of course, the 2014 Video Music Awards air live on August 24. The VMAs have confirmed fantastic performers like Usher and Ariana Grande and already booked greater ad revenue than last year's show.","In the current quarter, Comedy Central has hit an all-time high in volume of original programming, which now accounts for more than 50% of its schedule. In fact, Comedy is hitting its peak in terms of quantity and quality. It recently earned 21 Emmy nominations, a new best for Comedy Central, which also had more shows nominated than ever before. Remarkably, 4 out of the 6 nominees in the Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series category are Comedy Central shows. One of those series, Key & Peele, returns in the fall, as does the enduring hit, South Park. The sheer volume of original programming we're producing now and the ever-multiplying ways in which we're delivering it to audiences underscore the ongoing transformation of the viewing landscape.","When we look at video consumption across the many screens we program -- Linear TV, DVR playback, VOD, apps and streaming services -- we see overall viewership outside traditional measurement is growing strongly. This aggregated growth speaks to the continuing demand for high-quality content and the vitality of our brands. It also points to the yet untapped potential we see as new measurement tools are introduced, some as early as next quarter.","Across Viacom's networks, total video consumption of our full episode programming has grown year-over-year, with a number of our series seeing dramatic lift when you factor in time-shifted and on-demand viewing. Take MTV's Teen Wolf for example, a show with a very tech-savvy audience, an entire online and social media culture onto itself. Live-plus-same-day ratings for the just-completed cycle of Teen Wolf were up 18% among all viewers over the show's debut season in 2011. But when you factor in all measured screens, the total audience of the show is up 38% over the same time frame.","Comedy Central's Inside Amy Schumer is another great example. The show grew ratings in its recent second season over its first, but it doubled its total video consumption on nonlinear platforms, VOD, SVOD, and of course, the Comedy Central app. This show does particularly well in the day-4-plus window on VOD, which represents a great opportunity for us as dynamic ad insertion increasingly comes into play.","Moving on to international. We continue to expand and diversify our brand portfolio across the world. The June quarter saw the launch of a number of new networks, including the Paramount Channel in Romania. We've now launched 28 channels internationally since the beginning of 2013, and we will continue a steady pace of channel launches as we go forward and establish a platform for a much bigger international business.","We've also benefited significantly from the improved ad market abroad and the strategic moves we made during the economic downturn. International ad revenue increased 20% in the June quarter. MTV Italy continues to be a great story for us, with ratings up 20% since we acquired full ownership of the channel last fall. We launched the Paramount Channel in Spain 2 years ago and it has since grown to become the most-watched network in our international portfolio, with ratings up 50% in June. Currently available in 5 international markets, the Paramount Channel will take another big step forward when it launches in Latin America in November.","In Filmed Entertainment, the big story at Paramount Pictures is the biggest movie of the year thus far, Transformers: Age of Extinction, which recently surpassed $1 billion at the worldwide box office. The film now stands as the highest-grossing theatrical release of all time in China, a crowning achievement in its phenomenal international run.","Paramount announced last week that it has extended its first-look deal with film maker, Michael Bay, the visionary behind the multibillion-dollar Transformers franchise and many of the most popular films of the last quarter century. Hercules is also off to a strong start, with a solid debut domestically and internationally. The film will continue to roll out internationally over the next few months.","And this weekend, Paramount's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hits theaters, which marks another milestone in our revitalization of the franchise since acquiring it in 2009. Following on the heels of the film, Nickelodeon is rolling out 26 new episodes of the animated series, and continues to grow and build out new categories of the very successful Turtles consumer products lines.","Speaking of Nickelodeon, we announced earlier this week that Paramount Television will produce a live-action TV series based on Paramount Pictures' 2003 musical comedy, School of Rock, for the network. The series, which debuts in the spring of 2015, marks Paramount TV's first foray into children's programming and its first straight-to-series order. This announcement is the latest in a flurry of activity at Paramount's new television unit. We also recently announced that Oscar-winning screenwriter, Dustin Lance Black, will script his forthcoming Lindbergh limited-series event. Additionally, Paramount TV announced a first-look deal with Oscar-winning director, Robert Zemeckis, who has a long and storied history with the studio from Forrest Gump to Flight.","To close, we see a lot of opportunity at Viacom. We continue to invest more than $3 billion a year in content and connect with audiences that are consuming entertainment in more ways, across more platforms than ever. We're investing to capture growth opportunities, both at home and abroad, whether it's distributing and monetizing our content on new platforms, building or acquiring new networks internationally, or building robust television production, film animation and consumer products businesses. As ever, our focus is to continue to deliver results, create value and return substantial capital to our shareholders.","Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Wade.","Wade C. Davis","Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.","Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 1% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up 1%, while international revenues grew 2%. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.","In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 2% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were up 1% and international revenues increased 20%. The growth in international advertising reflects the impact of new channels, including MTV and other -- MTV Italy and other channels, as well as continued improvement in the European marketplace.","In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues were flat year-over-year, while international revenues were down 5%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew low-double digits in the quarter. The decrease in international revenues was due to the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, partially offset by new channel launches, increases in subscribers and higher subscriber rates.","Expenses increased 4% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 8%, while distribution and other expenses declined 17% year-over-year. SG&A expenses increased 3%. The decline in distribution and other expenses primarily reflects lower participations related to the timing of product available under certain affiliate distribution agreements.","Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 3%, and the adjusted operating income margin was 43%, a margin decrease of approximately 180 basis points compared to the prior year. The decline in adjusted operating income primarily reflects lower revenues from certain distribution arrangements and the increase in programming expense during the quarter. The margin decrease was driven by top line growth of 1%, which was more than offset by the 4% overall growth in expenses.","Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 26% in the quarter, principally due to the declines in theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased 43%, reflecting the number and timing of titles in the quarter. We released Transformers: Age of Extinction at the end of the June quarter, while we released Star Trek Into Darkness, World War Z and Pain & Gain in last year's June quarter. Home entertainment revenues declined 24%, primarily due to lower revenue from carryover titles, as well as the current quarter's releases. The decrease in TV license fees of 21% primarily reflects the number and mix of titles available in syndication.","Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $55 million in the quarter as compared to $17 million last quarter -- last year. The increase principally reflects the number of current quarter releases.","Moving to taxes. The year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32%, reflecting a 180-basis-point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability. In terms of noncontrolling interest, the $43 million principally reflect -- represents the minority interest share of income associated with the renewal of a content distribution agreement.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow and debt profile, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover factors impacting our September quarter.","For the quarter, we generated $571 million in operating free cash flow compared to $728 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. Decline in operating free cash flow in the quarter was due to higher cash taxes, which was primarily due to the sunsetting of provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense.","As for our debt, it is principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. In April, we completed the redemption of the $600 million outstanding of our 4.375% senior notes that were due in September.","In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we had incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 25 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end.","As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $12.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9x. At June 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.","Our long-term commitment to return capital to shareholders continued in the June quarter. During the quarter, we returned a total of $980 million of capital back to our shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs, and we ended the quarter with 424 million shares outstanding. For the September quarter, we are on pace to purchase approximately $850 million of our stock, which means that for the fiscal year 2014, we will have returned a total of nearly $4 billion to our shareholders.","Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the September quarter. In terms of our affiliate revenue, we continued to see long-term annual growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the September quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will grow double digits as compared to the prior year.","For the full year, we continue to expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the mid- to high-single digits. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins. For 2014, we are now forecasting a booked tax rate of 32%, reflecting the mix of domestic and international profitability.","Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline, we are in production on the hybrid live-action and CGI-animated film, Monster Trucks, which is directed by Chris Wedge. We are also in production on a reboot of Terminator, which is a coproduction in partnership with Sky Dance and is scheduled for release in July of 2015. And later this month, we will be going into production on Mission: Impossible V. The studio is also in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises including Star Trek, World War Z and Beverly Hills Cop.","In summary, we remain committed to investing in our brands, increasing the level of original programming on our networks, and strengthening the connection with our audiences on every screen. Our industry is evolving and consumers have an ever-increasing array of choices and ways to consume our content. Our continued investment in our organization, in our infrastructure, as well as advancements in technology, is enabling us to monetize our audiences as the industry evolves.","As we partner with distributors, we are increasingly able to deliver targeted ads to our viewers, both in our apps and on VOD through the use of dynamic ad insertion and first-party data. Advertisers are increasingly looking for new and innovative ways to reach their consumers. Our investment in specialized products within our ad sales offering, like Viacom's Velocity and Viacom's Echo, is enabling us to develop unique integrated marketing opportunities that create additional value for our advertisers. As Philippe mentioned, these were instrumental in helping us drive the increased volume in this year's Upfront. These investments and initiatives, combined with our continued focus on driving operating efficiency and on returning capital, will drive value for our shareholders.","As a matter of fact, if you go back to when we restarted our share buyback program in 2010, through the end of this fiscal year, we will have returned a total of $15.7 billion of capital to shareholders over the full year period. Our market cap, when we restarted the current program, was approximately $22 billion. So this represents a 70% return of capital as compared to our market cap at the start of the program. Our leverage ratio has gone from 1.9x during that period to 2.9x now within -- and it stays within our target range of 2.75 to 3.","With that, I want to turn the call over to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first one from John Janedis from Jefferies.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Philippe, you spoke to the soft domestic ad market. On the Upfront, were there particular categories where you gained share? And on the international side, can you speak to profitability and channel launches going forward? Does the Paramount Channel launch plan slow given penetration?","Philippe P. Dauman","Sorry, what was the last thing about the Paramount Channel brand?","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Does it -- does the Paramount Channel launch plan slow given the penetration increases?","Philippe P. Dauman","Okay, so in terms of the demand on -- in the advertising marketplace, there were certain advertisers in the consumer goods sector and the automotive sector who chose to either defer or withhold dollars from the upfront marketplace. And at the same time, there was some softness in some of the same sectors in demand in the scatter market. We have strength with many of our traditional advertisers, whether it's the movie category, new -- all the many new devices that are coming out, fast food areas, things like gums and other categories that we are strong in. And as both Tom and I mentioned in our remarks, we were greatly helped by the -- the targeting, the integrated marketing solutions that we were able to offer as part of this Upfront, and we were able to capture dollars and, we believe, gain market share in the Upfront. As far as our international launches, we are benefiting from an upturn in the advertising market, primarily in Europe. We're also benefiting from the channel launches we have done thus far, Paramount Channel being a new brand that we are rolling out. Obviously, as we achieve improving results in international, we are also absorbing the launch cost of Paramount Channels across our international footprint, but that will set a base for -- really enhance the growth as we go forward. So this is a good situation that we're in, in international because we're able to grow our aggregate profitability, while at the same time, investing a lot in our future growth. So we're going to have -- once we establish this brand, we're planning to launch another brand shortly. I've talked before about the SPIKE brand. We will have a much bigger platform, which we'll be able to monetize, both in distribution and advertising, consumer products in the case of our many Nickelodeon brands.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Philippe, I have 2 for you, particularly on the advertising theme, first domestic. This is your third straight quarter of ad growth that's come in weaker than we first expected into the quarter. So what do you think is driving that weakness in scatter? And what do you think improves that scatter in terms over the back half of this calendar year?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, in the case of this quarter where we had, at the beginning of the quarter, we were looking to mid-single digit growth and ended up at 1%. I would say about half of the difference related to the soft demand that we talked about before and half were some ratings issues at individual networks, in our particular case. And that the latter part, we expect to improve as programming rolls out. In terms of the back half, we see an improving economy. We do believe that some of the dollars that were withheld in the general Upfront market will be coming back in the scatter market. Some advertisers made the calculation that, either because of their individual situation or their perception of the general marketplace, that they would not be greatly disadvantaged by waiting for the scatter market and they would gain flexibility by waiting for the scatter market. Some of those advertisers who tried that in some prior years ended up costing themselves more money. We'll see what the future brings, but we do see a continued improvement in the economy. We do see a more competitive sector so we do expect, in that kind of environment, that the scatter market will pick up steam as the year progresses.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, let me ask you a quick one on international. You mentioned MTV Italy as a helping network. I know you spent a lot of time redoing your MTV Brazil partnership. So are you seeing any benefit now in the ad numbers from Brazil or is that to come?","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, MTV Brazil is really -- we've been expanding our distribution there. Our -- the ratings position has improved significantly in Brazil. We are currently in discussions in Brazil to further expand distribution of MTV and other brands.","In Latin America, in general, we see great opportunity. We have a great focus on that. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are launching the Paramount brand in November throughout many territories in Latin America, which will give us more heft on the distribution side and advertising side. So this is an opportunity that we had not monetized very strongly to date. And we -- for ourselves, we have a lot of catching up to do, and we are devoting a lot of effort to doing so.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, I guess. The first one is, if you could you can give us an update on the sort of TV production-side initiatives at Paramount, both from a, maybe, kind of projects in the works and when we might expect to see some -- the first kind of slate of shows and financial impact from that. And the second is kind of more big picture on the advertising side, forgetting maybe fiscal 3Q or 4Q. But you guys have been more forward thinking, at least from the outside, it looks like in terms of integrated digital, as well as traditional, linear advertising. And a lot of what you read in the press about the softness of the Upfront seem to suggest that some advertisers were moving money from traditional into digital advertising. Did you see any of that across your platforms as you sort of observed where money was being spent? And I guess, in a related sense, do you think that there's been a shift in the intermediate-term trajectory, kind of sustainable rate of cable advertising? [indiscernible] of growth?","Philippe P. Dauman","On the, David, on the TV production initiative, Paramount is making announcements as shows are gelling and getting distribution, so you will see a steady stream of announcements. The most recent one, of course, was the School of Rock with our very own Nickelodeon. The nice thing about our production activity in the current environment, which is a very good one for production activity, is we're able to build up this entirely new business with a very low overhead and a very low cost and, also, very little capital employed. So it will not have a major financial impact right away, but I think, as we continue to build it out over the next fiscal year, it will produce meaningful results to Paramount after that and it will be a steady build from there. So this is an exciting new business that will create strong long-term value for us. In terms of the big picture on the advertising side, in this Upfront, I think a major factor was really certain [indiscernible] -- particularly large advertisers who withheld dollars from the Upfront and every indication and it certainly seems to have been confirmed by remarks from some of our peers out there, every indication is that some of those dollars will come back in the scatter. And some of the other dollars may not come back, but it's more because of some difficult circumstances that an individual company or 2 are at in their general business where they're trying to save some dollars in the short term. At the same time, there are trends out there, which we are trying to and succeeding in participating in. There are a lot of dollars to capture by making use of data and putting our content out there on new platforms and getting monetization. And monetization is, of course, facilitated once you get measurement and that is improving. We're getting it on our own apps, because we have the data ourselves. Nielsen is rolling out a new measurement of mobile devices next quarter. That will help. So all the trend lines are such as to favor monetization on other platforms. And we are moving in that direction because our audiences are adopters of these other platforms. Our content is already being viewed by them. We're not getting the full monetization today because of some lag in the measurement and that will catch up over time.","Thomas E. Dooley","David, just to add to that, our -- Viacom's Echo product is a product where we joint venture with a company called Mass Relevance to measure Viacom's earned media across the social spectrum. So as dollars do move to digital, we're able to follow those dollars because a lot of the digital movement -- a lot of the activity in the digital space is consumption of our content and other big media companies' content. And we're now able to work with advertisers to measure that earned media, provide them with accurate statistics as to how their brand and their message travel across all those social platforms. And as Philippe said, the better we're able to measure that, the better we'll be able to -- and sooner we'll be able to, monetize that brand message being echoed across many platforms.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just jumping back to your commentary on the international business. I guess, what inning do you think you are in international expansion and your efforts to improve profitability there? I guess, any way you can give us some more color on the size of that opportunity?","Philippe P. Dauman","I think it's a huge opportunity. It's an opportunity that will not stop, so we are very early. I think the potential is -- so for many, many years of continued growth. I see double-digit annual growth in operating income from here on in, and I see our international business having the potential to become very big. This acquisition we're going to -- we expect to close this quarter of Channel 5, will build our business in a country that is very strong for us and where the economy is doing reasonably well, and it will be good for us in the U.K. But also, it's part of our ability to produce a lot more international content, which we will be able to distribute, not just in U.K, but around the world as we build existing brands and launch new brands. So this is a very, very big opportunity. In addition, on the distribution side internationally, there's some places where there are obstacles to traditional distribution, and we are benefiting and we see that growing from distribution on -- whether it's an SVOD platform, whether it's a distribution of certain content on mobile. So we just see a lot of opportunity across the board in many parts of the world.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on your -- I think, your commentary earlier about seeing -- expecting low single-digit growth in domestic advertising in the September quarter despite very challenging comps. Is that just from your -- is that from your expectations of the scatter lifting, like you had mentioned? Or are you actually seeing, I guess, little bit of a pickup as you're entering that quarter?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, again, another way -- everybody's pretty much closed out their Upfront season. You're seeing the market normalize a little bit in the scatter market, the pricing is strengthening a bit in the scatter market and, yes, we'll see how it unfolds. We do have a -- last year's quarter is a very strong quarter for us, so we're lapping that. And we're still early in the quarter. We'll see how it plays out.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Morris from Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. One, just back to the advertising potential from the distribution of your shows on multiple platforms. Can you talk about sort of the competitive environment there? You sound very bullish on the potential to see growth as the measurement improves. And I guess, my question is, do you feel that you are in a stronger position relative to your peers? Does the data that you have show that you can actually be share takers across platforms as that measurement improves? And then my second question is on the slate at MTV. I think Susanne Daniels has been with Viacom for about 1.5 years at this point. And I'm curious as you look at the slate of programs and the mix of sort of scripted versus non-scripted and the amount of new programming on MTV, do you feel like you've sort of achieved the mix that you want to be at? Or is this something that's still evolving? And anything that you can point to for how that mix would evolve from here would be helpful.","Philippe P. Dauman","Okay, Michael. Yes, there's evidence that our content performs very well in new platforms. Just take VOD, our content really outperforms our peers' content on video-on-demand. Our viewers, who are young -- remember, we are very young-skewing -- if you look at demos, we are the leading family of networks when it comes to teens in 2 to 34s. We have 30%-type market share in cable in those categories, and those are heavy users of new technologies. Those are -- they look at VOD. They use devices. So to the extent that we can monetize that, we will disproportionately benefit as compared to producers of content geared toward older audiences. We also happen to have a greater mix of original programming compared to other programmers. And again, original programming is what will play the best in these new platforms. As far as the programming on MTV, Susanne has done a great job in developing compelling scripted shows, which really drive our audiences. We also have a good slate of reality programming on the boards. We're also looking at some individual animated possibilities. So this is a continuing building effort as part of our overall Viacom plan to increase the level of compelling original programming that will play well on all platforms. This is a big initiative of ours. At the same time, we're also looking at creating much shorter-form content directly using these new platforms -- non-television content. That's also a separate opportunity that we're devoting new resources within our company to participate in.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I could follow up on that, how -- what would be the plan for capitalizing on a different form of content? I mean, would that go on to linear networks or through your existing web properties? Or would you look to invest in different web properties to monetize that?","Philippe P. Dauman","Michael, as you know, we're launching a lot of apps. We think that the apps should have not just the television content that we have, but it should have a lot of complementary content and social media connections. We have, on MTV, we have a very successful budding effort to provide topical information of what's happening in the culture on our websites and our apps. And more broadly, we see mobile operators, the big ones like AT&T and Verizon and others, really looking as we go into the future to enhance their mobile and make case for small devices, mobile video content. And so we think there will be new opportunities on both distribution and advertising side to monetize \"made for those platform\" short-form content, and we're already working on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Just following up on your comments on the strength of viewing on other platforms. I was wondering if you can give us any updated thoughts on how you think the inclusion of mobile-device-viewing data will impact reported viewership or ad revenues on Nick and kids' channels in the year ahead. And secondly, I was curious about your thoughts about selling traditional TV inventory programmatically? Or otherwise, driving more data automation into the process of buying and selling.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, as far -- if I understood your question on Nickelodeon, the opportunity to monetize content appearing in apps, we've launched the Nick apps very successfully. We are able to add some advertising elements there. We're looking at other -- for some of our other Nick brands and other opportunities we might have to really mine additional advertising revenues, either directly on those or in connection with our television offerings. So that is showing an opportunity for Nick. As far as programmatic advertising for -- in terms of the television product, we don't see much appeal for that right now. It is useful for certain digital product, what I'd call more commoditized inventory. And what we offer, we provide a unique offering, for which we get high CPMs, of premium inventory, integrated marketing opportunities, as Tom referred to, marrying that with social media. None of that is captured in programmatic buying, which really does not provide the value to advertisers that we're able to provide with our premium video content.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I guess, on the mobile question, I guess, partially I was wondering about the consequences of OCR, in particular, and just given the issues around measuring younger audiences. But on the programmatic issue, I guess, I was also thinking more on the -- your longer-tail inventory. If there -- if you see any opportunity for the Saturday, 10:00 a.m. on your lowest rated network, for example, if you see any opportunity? Or if again, it just doesn't make sense in the context of how you sell?","Thomas E. Dooley","Brian, as you know, we still run a schedule across many of our networks, with some exceptions, some notable exceptions. For the most part that inventory, therefore, is not subject or applicable to the programmatic world. Where we do have some -- what I would label as remnant inventory, very little of it, and the amounts we have there, we do participate in the programmatic marketplace. But I don't think it's a significant factor in our business, as we continue to emphasize, as Philippe said, how to work with advertisers to come up with integrated marketing solutions to turbocharge their brand region consumer focus.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2. The first, Tom, you said affiliate revenue in September is going to be up double digits. Is that low double-digits? Teens? Any range you could give would be great. And then, Philippe, you talked about the Upfront. The volume was up to low- to mid-single digits. What about CPM increases for your portfolio?","Philippe P. Dauman","So as far -- I'll take -- on the affiliate side. Yes, as we indicated, we expect the full year to be high-single digit to low-double digit. So I think you can -- knowing the results of our first 9 months, you can figure out the range we expect for affiliate revenue in this quarter. So in short, it will be not low-double digits. As far as the Upfront CPM...","Thomas E. Dooley","Upfront CPM, we're -- very adeptly managed by our ad sales force. The folks that gave us significant volume increases, paid CPM increases in the low to mid-single-digit range. The people that did not give us significant volume increases paid in the high single-digit range.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Philippe, can I just ask you one more question on what's driving the variability in the September quarter for affiliates used?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, again, within our affiliate revenue base, if you look at it on an annualized basis, and as Tom mentioned in his remarks, we have quarterly fluctuation that is really caused by product availability under deals with companies like Amazon, like Hulu, like some of the others that we deal with. And their -- we have the revenue recognition ties into product availability. So you get some variations when you look at last year's third -- third fiscal quarter, we had a big Amazon Prime deal that hit, which resulted in the flat affiliate fees we had in that quarter. This quarter, we have some different dynamics, where we have a combination of our continued steady, very strong traditional affiliate revenues, supplemented by, in this case, some better comps on the revenue recognition relating to product availability, and it's as simple as that. So on a full year basis, it all washes out, and when you get back to our consistent guidance year after year of high single-digit to low double-digit growth in affiliate revenues.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So given how the advertising revenue growth is panning out this year, I was wondering at what point investors should worry that the Viacom story, which is modest sub2 [ph] rating and earnings growth and a lot of buyback, is in danger? Is low double -- low single-digit advertising revenue growth in the U.S. enough for you to keep doing what you are doing, and what drove the stock price up?","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, Vasily, we have a lot of confidence in our growth opportunities as we go forward. We've been able to invest in growth. We have many opportunities for growth as we go forward. We think there are advertising opportunities that, in addition to the traditional ones, as we've been talking a lot about during this call, that relate to all these new platforms. We have the ability, thanks to the strength of our brands, our #1 position in all the important demos in our peers set, we're able to drive affiliate revenues at a consistent high single-digit to low double-digit rate. We are growing our international business very significantly. We are growing new revenues, whether it's television production, or animation efforts, consumer products, as we create content that is susceptible to ancillary revenues, including consumer products. So we see a lot of opportunity. We are disciplined in maintaining cost -- our cost structure, evolving our cost structure, while investing for the future, generating cash flow and really being focused on organic growth. Very targeted occasional acquisitions in the international arena, which will -- which we are very disciplined looking at as being accretive, and we believe we create a lot of value for our shareholders by returning capital to them. And that formula we've been consistently pursuing now for close to 8 years, Tom and I, and we will continue to do so.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, so it sounds like the buyback is not in danger.","Philippe P. Dauman","Not at all.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant from ISI Group.","David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It's David Joyce. Question on dynamic ad insertion again, if I could. I think you've got a -- the trial out there now with Time Warner Cable. I don't know what you can talk about there. I was just wondering how widely -- when that would be widely distributed? When do you think it moves the needle? Does it seem like it's more of a product beyond the C plus 7? Or is it more for closer in-viewing for on-demand? And is it more from incremental advertisers or your current advertising base, such as those that you were selling to in the Upfronts?","Thomas E. Dooley","David, the dynamic insertion is a great new opportunity for us. The Time Warner experiment has been a terrific one. However, the volumes have been very small. The demand on the advertising side with this kind of product is great. And the sooner we escalate it, I think the more advertisers that will participate with us, because it allows a lot of data to come into play and a lot more targeting capabilities associated with that advertiser, which draws very, very nice EPMs relative to a regularly distributed commercial insertion. We are working with the other distribution partners and anticipate dynamic ad insertion agreements pretty much on a national level over the next couple of quarters. And when that happens, then we'll be able to produce this kind of inventory upscale somewhere into the second half of 2015. And I think it will benefit significantly, our ability to grow advertising and be much more precise in terms of the delivery of audience. We're working with a lot of partners who are just trying to figure out how to define that audience delivery. There's a lot of revolution on the advertising side to define who that specific audience target is. But as we get better at that and they get better at that, I think this will be a very fast-growing piece of the equation. As far as when we're going to start dynamic ad insertion, we've been doing it after the third day in 4-plus, and that has been very successful for us. And we haven't moved to the C7 currency, as you've heard out there, and dynamic ad insertion is more of an emphasis for us than C7.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Barton Crockett from FBR Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I thought I'd ask a question about consolidation since it really hasn't come up yet on this call. The waves of interest in consolidation have kind of, obviously, crested and fallen here. But you guys have some experience here, at least on the other side. You used to be one with CBS. And I was just wondering -- obviously, it was a different world back then. But did you feel, when you were part of one company with a lot of networks that you would would've had more leverage than you do today? And do you see any viable argument that makes sense for a company like Viacom to merge to get bigger in the U.S. to combat the consolidation of cable?","Philippe P. Dauman","Barton, we are focused on creating shareholder value and fortunately, because of the consolidation that we participated in much earlier than this era, we have built up a portfolio of networks that is #1. We have the strategic scale today. We don't have to buy it to be there. So we're #1 in 2 plus, so age 2 to 102, we have the #1 market share in our network family for all viewers; it's over 17%. If you take 2 to 49, we have over 23% market share, #1; 2 to 34, 27.5%, this is all according to Nielsen, #1; teens, we're #1. I could go on, but we have the leading positions in all that, and that's why we are able to do well as we drive affiliate revenues. We provide good value at the same time. We are still a low-priced family of networks. We provide a lot of functionality. Our audiences are using our distributors' VOD platform very heavily. They are using a different device and services that our distributors are offering their own customers. So we are in good shape. We're focusing on creating value in all issues. That's our singular focus, how can we create more value in Viacom, and we've done well in that regard, and by the way, since the split from CBS. So, yes, we were together. We've both done well on our own as we've gone forward, and as we've talked throughout about this call, Viacom has a lot of opportunities to grow as we go forward. And it's strategically well positioned to do so.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.","I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC.","Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed in this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter, we were hard at work executing against the strategy we presented six months ago to revitalize our core business and I'm pleased to say that we've made considerable progress.","We're seeing real green shoots across our brands and our business and meaningful improvement in our balance sheet. I'll speak to this progress after taking you through our high-level numbers, which Wade will subsequently discussed in depth.","From a financial perspective, performance in the third quarter continued to show improvement with overall revenues up 8%. An increase in affiliate revenues and sequential improvement in advertising performance contributed to solid results. We've also seen gains across all Filmed Entertainment business lines and continued revenue growth in the international business.","Media Networks operating income held steady and Filmed Entertainment operating income return to growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2015. This performance drove double-digit increases in adjusted net earnings and EPS for the quarter, up 12% and 11%, respectively.","At the same time, we continued to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet. In addition to the sale of our interest in EPIX, we took the proceeds and cash on hand to redeem over $1 billion of outstanding debt, continuing to demonstrate our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and making us stronger and more flexible for the future.","Now, moving to the heart of Viacom; our brands. We are making clear progress in our strategy to revitalize our brands, particularly the flagship six, and accelerate Viacom's evolution into the leading global multiplatform branded entertainment company.","To that end, we're seeing improvement across our portfolio and across every platform. Ratings is understandably one of my main areas of focus and I've seen a marked change in the numbers over the past few months as a result of the actions we've taken.","They've done what was a sea of red towards increasingly a sea of green, particularly when it comes to share with revenue weighted live same-day share up 4% in the quarter across the entire portfolio. And in an environment where most stable groups saw ratings declines, our C3 ratings were up 1% year-over-year and I'm happy to say this momentum continued through July.","Bright spots include MTV, which is really starting to gain traction and which I'll talk more about in a moment. BET, the brand had its strongest June year-over-year ratings growth in four years and July was the network's second consecutive month of year-over-year growth.","Nick remains the number one rated kids network by far, dominating with nine of the top 10 shows for kids six to 11 and four of the top five shows for kids two to five. At comedy, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah achieved its highest-rated and most-watched quarter ever.","VH1 has had eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth, the longest active streak among major entertainment networks. And CMP and TV Land have all been performing very well and generating positive ratings growth.","This momentum is true internationally too, where last quarter's revenue weighted share for women's portfolio increased 6% with growth across each and every one of our paid brands as well as at Channel 5 and Telefe.","Now, I'd like to briefly highlight efforts at MTV, which, as I mentioned, is seeing strong early results, reflecting the relentless work by the team to implement their new strategy. After five years of declining ratings, this June, MTV achieved a 3% increase in ratings and a 14% increase in share, marking the first June year-over-year ratings increase since 2011 and July was even stronger.","Last month saw a 19% increase in share and a 12% year-over-year ratings increase, the first double-digit increase in four years. And MTV got back into the top five cable networks in prime time for viewers 18 to 34. And this doesn't even reflect the strong performance of Siesta Key, which debuted this week and was MTV's second-highest rated series premiere in the last two years after Fear Factor, which debuted in May.","And the new content the team is bringing to air is much more cost-effective, freeing up resources to invest in more programming. As we look to fiscal 2018, MTV will have 60% more original hours versus 2017 and it will actually spend less. That includes more live programming, which bridges linear and digital platforms, and there's no better example of this than the new TRL, which will program as many minutes per day for social platforms as it does for linear when it launches on October 2nd.","So, what you've seen to-date is just the beginning as a bigger, truly multiplatform MTV is coming, when it will complement its clear and growing linear momentum with much more digital activity like the recent hit reboot of Cribs on Snapchat or our industry-first 1 million followers status on Musical.ly; and in 2018, a bigger focus on live events and expanding into feature films.","And speaking of live events, I'm happy to say that we continue to make progress on the ground across the portfolio, creating and executing experiences that engage our fans in the real world.","Fiscal year-to-date, we've had 1.5 million people on the ground at our events, a number that will continue to grow. To name just a few, the inaugural Comedy Central Colossal Clusterfest attracted more than 40,000 attendees to rave reviews. And this year's BET experience had 165,000 fans on the ground.","Internationally, more than 50,000 people took part in our I love MTV Malta music event. And here in New York, Spike's BELLATOR came to Madison Square Garden, the world's most famous arena.","Moving to the studio side, the business, of course, will take time to turn around, but we are seeing improvement in 2017. While Transformers: The Last Knight didn't perform to expectations, there were certainly points of strength. It was the number one domestic film on its opening weekend and internationally, it's opened number one in 53 markets to-date.","But the more important point is that the revitalization of Paramount is well underway as we fill out Executive leadership at the studio. We're especially excited about the launch of Paramount Players, the home of our branded and lower budget films and the appointment of a Brian Robbins to lead it. He's the perfect Executive to attract fresh new talent and help connect our brand to the big screen and he's already hard at work.","We're also very excited about the appointment of Mireille Soria who joined as our new Animation Head in July. She was previously Co-President of Feature Animation at DreamWorks Animation, and we're looking forward to her making her mark at Paramount.","Lastly, and representative of our brand's unique multiplatform orientation, we couldn't be more excited about the landmark talent deal we did this quarter, a first of its kind cross-portfolio deal with Tyler Perry, spanning TV, film, short form and digital. This is the -- exactly the kind of cross-house deal we want to do, partnering with the best, most versatile talent in the film industry who can work flexibly across our brand and platforms to bring great content to our audiences. This is also a part of our plan to take BET to the next level.","Moving from brands to the business. Last quarter, we made swift progress with our renewed partnership focus with an emphasis on putting the full power of Viacom to work for our partners, using our points of strength, our brands, our extensive largely on content offering, our data and advanced advertising capabilities, our marketing power, and our global footprint to help us succeed together.","And this is evident on the advertising side, where we're seeing solid momentum coming out of the U.S. up front, which resulted in volume growth and mid to high single-digit CPM increases across the Board. The changes underway at the brands are making a real difference.","In particular, advertisers have responded to the new Paramount Network, the revamp direction at MTV, and continued strength at Nickelodeon. They also love the value and dependable delivery at networks like TV Land.","We continue to find that advertiser will recognize the value of TV quantity advertising, appreciate the controlled premium environment that Viacom can offer, and increasingly, look to our company for innovation including our advanced advertising products.","And on the distribution side, we announced in May global multiyear agreements with Altice. These agreements extend our Cablevision agreement and reintroduce Viacom networks on Suddenlink starting this month.","They include a first of its kind partnership to combine Altice's unique audience data, multiplatform measurement, and analytics capabilities with Viacom's advanced advertising expertise to deliver local and national advertising across platforms. It also includes the licensing of Paramount product in France.","This demonstrates that we're delivering on our commitment to be flexible and creative and that our work on developing and launching new innovative solutions for the benefit of our distribution partners from improved TV Everywhere products, the data-driven advanced advertising solutions is a true differentiator for Viacom.","As we do this, we're also obviously cognizant of what's going on with the pay-TV universe. We have seen marketplace information on the clients and we've seen it in our numbers, too.","For us, it reinforces the importance of alignment with our partners. We need to work together to ensure consumers have the best possible pay-TV experience. That means accessing content the way they want it on all devices in linear and on-demand. And it also means providing choice across price points. The ship has sailed on everyone having $100 bundle.","Many consumers want lower price options including options below $40 and so, we continue to focus on leveraging our unique attributes to be part -- a core part of that offering.","And I'll say again that low price entertainment packs will be a reality. This will be a critical development in the arc of pay-TV subscriptions and it will be a positive development for Viacom.","Moving beyond that U.S., this deeper level of partnership and more flexible creative consumer offerings is a big part of our international strategy. Our vast global infrastructure continues to be a real competitive advantage.","As we capitalize on the various market dynamics to continue growing our pay-TV footprint and, very importantly, experiment with new distribution models. We've launched 12 new channels internationally this fiscal year and have announced that we will launch the Paramount channel in the U.K. in January.","On the new distribution front, in Japan, the launch of MTV on mobile has transformed our audience reach in that market and now has consumption that surpasses linear viewing.","We're also working directly with mobile carrier, Telkomsel in Indonesia, to make our branded Nick and Nick Jr. Play Plex apps available to 170 million subscribers as they increasingly migrate to consume data.","And we've just announced a content development collaboration with iQIYI China's leading OTT video service, which will bring an original Chinese animated series to Nick Asia for the first time following a digital premier on iQIYI's platform.","In sum, and then stepping back to look at the big picture, while there's still more work to do and industry trends to navigate, we're very pleased with the quick progress we've made to revitalize the business.","I'll now hand it over to Wade to take you through the numbers.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon. We're pleased to report our financial results for the June quarter of fiscal 2017. In the quarter, we saw revenue growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment as well as growth in adjusted operating income and operating free cash flow.","We continue to execute on our strategic plan by extending and broadening our relationships with key distribution partners, evolving our advertising business including leveraging our leadership position and advanced ad -- TV ad products and strengthening our balance sheet.","During the quarter, we took additional actions to delever including the sale of our stake in EPIX and the completion of our recent tender offer in which we retired over $1 billion of debt.","Before I go through the adjusted operating results, I want to note that we took $59 million of restructuring and programming charges in the quarter. These actions principally result from new leadership and the implementation of our strategic plan at Paramount.","In terms of consolidated results, Viacom generated revenue of $3.4 billion, an 8% increase over the prior year and adjusted operating income of $805 million, which was up 5%.","We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.17, an increase of 11% over the prior year. And year-to-date, we've generated $548 million of operating free cash flow, which is up 71% over last year.","Topline growth was driven by growth across all Filmed Entertainment revenue streams as well as an increase in affiliate and advertising revenues at Media Networks. Slide four of our web deck provides the financial overview of our Media Networks segment.","Revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $2.6 billion. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased 4% and advertising revenues increased 2%, while ancillary revenues were down 9%. Adjusted operating income was substantially flat at $870 million.","Slide five of our web deck provides the breakdown of our Media Networks domestic and international revenue performance. Domestic revenues were flat at $2 billion, while international revenues increased 8% to $522 million.","On an organic basis, if we exclude a five percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact and a 14 percentage point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenues declined 1% in the quarter.","At our Media Networks business, domestic affiliate revenues were up 4%, our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The performance in the quarter was due to a timing benefit related to revenues from certain SVOD and OTT agreements, as well as contractual rate increases, partially offset by a decline in subscribers.","In line with our guidance, domestic advertising in the quarter improved sequentially to decline 2%. This compares to a year-over-year decline of 4% in the March quarter. In the quarter, price increases were more than offset by lower impressions.","Importantly, however, we made a decision to reduce ad loads in the quarter at a number of our networks in order to improve the viewer experience. If you exclude the impact of these unit load reductions, domestic ad sales would have been up 1% in the quarter.","The 17% decline in domestic ancillary revenue to $71 million was principally driven by the timing of revenue associated with consumer products arrangement as well as our decision to rest the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise ahead of its relaunch in 2018.","Now, turning to international. Advertising revenues increased 14% in the quarter. If we exclude a seven percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency and a 22 percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe, organic international advertising revenue declined 1%. The organic performance reflects growth driven by our global brands offset by softness in the U.K. due to Brexit.","International affiliate revenues increased 1% including a four percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency and a four percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe.","The growth in the quarter reflects the impact of new channel launches, rate increases and subscriber growth, partially offset by a decline in revenues from SVOD and OTT agreements.","Worldwide expenses increased 3% in the quarter and reflect an unfavorable three percentage point impact from the acquisition of Telefe. Within operating expenses, programming expense declined 3% due to timing of programming premieres.","Distribution and other expense increased 39%, driven principally by higher participations related to the timing of SVOD revenues in the quarter. SG&A expense increased 7% in the quarter due to the acquisition of Telefe as well as higher employee costs.","Now, turning to the studios results for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment revenues were up 36%, driven by increases across all revenue streams. Slide six of the earnings presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.","Theatrical revenues increased 189% to $263 million, primarily reflecting the performance of our current quarter releases, Transformers: The Last Knight and Baywatch as compared to the performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the June quarter last year.","Filmed Entertainment revenues increased 14% to $218 million, primarily reflecting catalog distribution revenues. Ancillary revenues increased 61% to $66 million in the quarter.","Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $9 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $26 million in the prior year, an improvement of $35 million. The improvement was driven by the increase in revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses.","Now, turning to our co-financing relationships. We just recently extended our successful partnership with David Ellison's Skydance Productions for another four years. The agreement allows for Skydance to co-finance and co-produce certain Paramount properties while giving Paramount the first opportunity to co-finance and distribute all movies Skydance produces.","As an update on our slate financing deal with our Chinese partners, there's been a delay in our June payment, and as a result, we've made the decision not to book any impact of the deal in the quarter. The deal continues to be in effect and we view HuaHua Media's acquisition by Oriental Time Media we know well as a positive. I would also like to the reiterate that we've been in business with HuaHua for a long time and may have and continue to be a valuable strategic operational and financial partner.","Now, moving below the line. The increase in equity income primarily reflects the recognition of profits on transaction with EPIX than have been previously deferred. In terms of taxes, the year-to-date effect -- adjusted effective tax rate 30.5% as compared to 32.8% in the prior year, driven by the mix of domestic and international income.","Slide 11 of the earnings presentation provides the components of free cash flow. We generated $205 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter, which is 128% improvement versus the prior year.","Year-to-date, we generated $548 million of operating free cash flow, which is up 71% year-over-year. The increase in operating free cash flow was driven by improvements in working capital at Filmed Entertainment including lower film spend, partially offset by higher cash taxes.","Turning to leverage, which is detailed on slide 10. Since we announced our strategic plan on February 9th and our commitment to delevering, we have reduced the gross debt by approximately $2 billion or 15%.","In terms of our debt, at quarter end, it was principally fixed rate with an average cost of 4.9%. We had $11.2 billion of total debt outstanding and $425 million of cash and cash equivalents. If you take into consideration the equity credit we received in our hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter end was $10.5 billion.","During the quarter, we continued to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our liquidity, and delever the company. In May, we completed the sale of our stake in EPIX for $634 million inclusive of dividends. Net after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately $570 million.","In June, we used these proceeds as well as cash from operations to redeem over $1 billion of debt. These actions were taken with the goal of supporting our long-term strategic initiatives and maintaining investment-grade metrics. We will continue to explore opportunities to monetize non-core assets, enhance our cash flow, as well as take other actions to achieve our stated objectives.","Now, let's turn to some of the factors impacting the September quarter of fiscal 2017. In terms of worldwide ad sales, for the September quarter, we expect to see continued sequential improvement. This is driven by ongoing double-digit growth in international, partially offset by a decline in domestic.","We expect the September quarter domestic ad sales decline to be similar to the June quarter's decline, including a similar impact from our decision to continue to reduce ad loads. We are pleased with the progress we have made to-date in broadening our relationships with our distribution partners and maturing early renewals.","In terms of the domestic affiliate revenues, given the timing benefit related to SVOD and OTT agreements shifting into the June quarter, we expect domestic affiliate revenues to decline in the low single digits for the September quarter. As for international affiliate revenues, we anticipate continued growth in the September quarter.","For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks' programming spend will now be in the low to mid-single-digits including the impact of the acquisition from Telefe, partially offset by benefits from our restructuring actions.","For the full year, on an organic basis, we expect Media Networks' SG&A expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. However, including the acquisition of Telefe, reported SG&A expense will grow in the high single-digits. In terms of taxes, for 2017, we forecast a book tax rate of approximately 31%.","With that said, I'd like to turn it back over to Bob to wrap it up.","Robert Bakish","Thank you, Wade. As I think you've seen, the financials for the quarter reflects an arc of progress across many facets of the business, but they also reflect certain challenges. Some challenges are a result of the time it takes new leadership to realize the benefits of the changes we're making, as in the case of the studio and our distribution relationships.","But know that we remain highly focused, focused on revitalizing our company and strengthening the performance of our brands including the studio. Some of this is already happening, and we have a clear line of sight to more.","At the same time, we're actively working to reinvest, to address the shifting landscape, to film new and growing sources of consumer and partner demand both year and all around the world.","As we do all of this, organic execution is obviously critical. But we will also look broadly including a potential partnership and M&A opportunities to both strengthen our position and accelerate our transition.","As we assess opportunities, know that we will be rigorous and disciplined that we will be guided by our strategy, our ability to execute, and our overriding commitment to creating shareholder value. This is something that we have successfully accomplished in the past, with Channel 5 in the U.K., Viacom 18 in India, and, more recently, with Telefe in Argentina.","But to be clear, incremental opportunities may or may not happen. At the core, our overwhelming focus is on organic execution. We continue to see great opportunity at Viacom and the potential for material value creation from the assets we own.","Thanks for your support. We look forward to continuing the dialogue with you as we move forward. And now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]","Our first will come from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Hi, thank you. Bob, as you know, we've seen some X numbers from your peers from a subscriber perspective. So, what kind of trends are you seeing at the flagship six or core nine compared to the smaller networks? Is your outlook for stabilization? And can you give us an apples-to-apples domestic growth rate ex the extra timing I guess for the current quarter?","Robert Bakish","So, there's a bunch of questions in there. Let's talk about the sort of pay-TV environment and some of the decline that's been discussed. So, a couple of pieces. So, the internal data that we have showed a slight degradation from Q2 to Q3, and that data shows a run rate of about minus 3.5%. That's a sad number.","Now, it's important to note that that data because the internal data based on remits we get from operators that has arrived, so it's incomplete. Now, in general, our internal data tracks with Nielsen in terms of the shape of the curve, i.e. when we're -- when they see improvement, we tend to see it, when there's degradation, they see it.","So, if you look at the Nielsen data, which runs now from July, that data improved by 0.04 of a percentage point from May to July, so that suggests our data will too and we think the quarter will likely finished once we get through all these remits in the low 3s in terms of decline.","So, I would characterize that as sort of moderation in the -- versus some of the things that people are talking about. And by the way, our data includes the impact of remits from both MVPDs and VMVPDs because we are seeing some growth from the VMVPD side.","Wade Davis","In terms of the question as it relates to the timing shift, if you look at the apples-to-apples third quarter to fourth quarter, if you were to take out and adjust for the shift of the timing of the SVOD agreements, both quarters would have been essentially flat. The growth in -- the majority of the growth in the third quarter and the low single-digit decline in the fourth quarter would have normalized out if we had shifted at that.","John Janedis","Okay. And maybe one quick. Given the comments that you made around the China slate financing, can you give us a little more detail on where you are there?","Wade Davis","Yes, I mean, as I said in my remarks, the deal is in effect. There was a delay in the June quarter payment and as a result, we decided to not book any impact of the June quarter in our financial statements.","We've been in business with HuaHua for a long time. They've been a fantastic operating partner in China. They've really moved the needle for us on a number of the pictures that have been highly successful in China. They've been a co-financer -- co-financier for us for years.","And as I said, we view the transaction that they entered into with OTMC is positive. OTMC is a fantastic company and a company that, frankly, is also well aligned with our Media Networks business in China.","So, notwithstanding the delay in the June payment, everything's on track. We're happy with our partnership there. We're working with those guys every week and everything is fine.","Robert Bakish","Take our next question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. A couple of questions as well. Just finishing out on the September quarter affiliate revenue or I guess 3Q and 4Q being flat, if subs are down around 3.5% maybe improving to low 3s in the September quarter, and you're doing flat, I guess the simple math would be your average rate increases are in that same 3%, 3.5%. And I seem to remember a previous commentary that rate annual escalators were more in the mid to high single-digits range, is that right?","Wade Davis","Well, for the quarter, the rate increases were around four percentage--.","Doug Mitchelson","Sorry, you cut out there.","Wade Davis","For the quarter, the contractual rate increase was in fact was around four percentage points.","Doug Mitchelson","Should investors think that's a good run rate to use in their models company going forward or based on negotiations you're having with Altice or ongoing conversations you have with other renewals that might be coming up? You expect that to improve, deteriorate, is that a good run rate number?","Robert Bakish","I think that the mid-singles is the right run rate to be thinking about. The content from the Altice deal, they're going to start lightning Suddenlink subs this month. They may even announce it today. They also talked about it on the earnings call and talking about a 90% penetration of Viacom services on that. So, that'll be beneficial. I think thinking about a mid-singles as a sort of annual price component is probably the right way to think about it.","Now, of course, we will, as we get into next fiscal year, have some renewal activity. We're already in discussion around some of that. That has the potential to affect that. But as a general model, I think mid-single is the way to think about it.","Doug Mitchelson","And since you mentioned it, can you give investors a sense of what percentage of distribution does come up for renewal next year?","Robert Bakish","We don't typically disclose it. We do have staggered long-term deals, so we don't have any kind of majority distribution base coming up any year. We have deals that go so well past 2020. But we have some renewal activity and we're already in discussions around that, although these things typically don't get done early.","Altice was a little unusual in that, and that was a deal that was done before the term ended as a result of some of the value they saw across the combination. But again, we do have -- it's an ongoing business and there are discussions, and ultimately, we're going to be focused on ensuring we get the best results for Viacom.","Doug Mitchelson","Bob, my other question was on M&A. I know you addressed it in your prepared remarks, but I think it will be helpful for investors that you are very focused on your turnaround strategy, improving the balance sheet as to -- as you approach whether there was a recent M&A transaction that was speculated or as you sort of look out at other possibilities, what the attractiveness of M&A might be for the company, again, notwithstanding that you'll be disciplined.","Robert Bakish","Yes, no, that's fair. Obviously, we're not going to comment on anything specific. But in general, we think it's our obligation to look at the full range of opportunities that present itself to the company as we look to strengthen our positioning in the industry and accelerate -- and\/or I should say accelerate our transition and getting to the multiplatform place that we have as our vision.","So, we look at stuff. I believe it's beneficial to look at stuff, point one. Point two, as we do that, we are going to continue to be very rigorous and look at where we see value and how much that value is worth and ensure that we have confidence in execution so that we can capture that value.","Again, personally, Wade, and I have been involved in a number of transactions which reflect that. Those happen to be international transactions, but I think it's important that we look.","But rest assured, we are going to be focused on creating shareholder value. That is ultimately what this is all about and if we see an interesting transaction that can do that, then we will engage there. But beyond that, it's really hard to comment.","Doug Mitchelson","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks Bob. You guys have -- you're having regular conversations with distributors. You've also extended some large ones, I think, after announcing the flagship six strategy shift. Can you just talk about how those renewals were approached on both sides as you sort of shift your investments around? I think there's a lot of concern that the revenue falls away from the non-flagship six as you move forward.","But you've already signed some extensions with large distributors after announcing those deals. So, you maybe you could just talk about how that all works from an economics perspective now that you've done some deals post the announcement.","And then sticking with the Media Net on expenses, same sort of kind of question. As you change the strategy at Media Nets, you've talked about not having to significantly increase investment in content. You still feel confident in that? Sitting here whatever it is, eight or nine months or seven or eight months since you first announced and you talked about the opportunities around cost as you head into the back half of next year?","Robert Bakish","Yes, sure. So, look, on the affiliate side, one of our -- before we get to the flagship six, which I'll address, our fundamental belief is that there's benefit to much more engagement, which is more regular engagement and broader engagement. And again, that's -- you could characterize that as a page from the international playbook, but my experience is that it yielded great dividends there and so we've been applying it here. And you could argue that the Altice outcome was an example of that working.","Now, within that, by broadening discussion, frankly, you have more levers to play with. And this -- the ad lever in the form of data-driven advertising is a lever that has attracted a significant interest. And in fact, we're having conversations, I would say, at this point really with almost all of the distributors about that and are in various stages of expanding our partnership to address that. And importantly, as we do that, getting access to tens of millions of homes on a dynamic ad insertion basis, which again is a place where we can create value.","Now, in the context of brand carriage, which is a component of the discussion and really the core of your question, you should conceptually think of Viacom services in three buckets: the flagship six, obviously; then another three networks that are widely distributed and have, frankly, strong audience engagement, but because of the definition of the flagship, which includes things like a piece of the feature film slate, doesn't really fit. Those are TV Land, CMT and VH1. And then there's a third segment, which is a whole set of smaller, call them, digital services with a distribution basis in 20 million -- I don't know 40 million, 50 million range, right?","Now, if you look at the affiliate revenue composition against those buckets, the vast majority of it is in the flagship bucket, there is some real affiliate revenue in the second bucket. There's not a whole lot, maybe 5% in the third bucket. And actually I think it's even less than that.","And so as we've gone into these discussions, first thing we're focused on is demonstrating our commitment to the value and performance of the flagship six. And if you think about that, you've got the world's leading preschool channel in Nick Jr., the world's leading kid's channel, Nickelodeon. You have MTV, which is in need of some revitalization, but frankly, on a very good track. I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing there. And by the way, that was a very well-received component of our discussions with advertisers, which I think is also a good, if you will, market test.","We got rid of the only comedy network in the U.S. certainly and then you've got the leading African-American network. And then coming in January, you've got Spike reposition, rebranded as Paramount with really a very strong product line upcoming. And so people get that, that's valuable.","And then when you add to the fact -- I mean, a lot of the early concerned around the flagships were like, does that mean TV Land is going away? And the reason operators were worried about that is it actually delivers very nice-sized 50-plus audiences that tend to be bill players.","So, at least to-date, we've had, I'd say, productive discussions and in the case of Altice, a productive renewal, against the backdrop of our flagship strategy. And I think as the year -- the calendar year continues to play out, people will see that continue to gain an audience performance and that will help. So, it's certainly a subject to discussion. But as you put the facts on the table, you add these other pieces of value, to-date, we've been happy with the navigation.","Then you asked a question about expenses, also relates to the flagship six. Let me touch on that and Wade might want to add in general. The flagship strategy is about -- it's prioritization and expense and shifting. As we look into our fiscal 2018 as an example, we're significantly increasing our investment on the Paramount side. We're also increasing investment at BET. And as a result of that, we are shifting some investment that was, historically, in some other places.","We fundamentally believe that is the right way to ensure real brand strength and therefore portfolio value for Viacom, but it's a part of the strategy that I envisioned in February and that we are -- have been executing as we've gone through the year including in the prior quarter with our restructuring and certainly will be manifesting itself in our 2018 budget, which we're not quite done with yet. We still have a little on that. So, hopefully that helps and addresses your questions.","Wade Davis","Just to point that -- just to put a finer point, we don't expect any significant increase in expenses around content spending. In the aggregate, it's very much a remix. That's what we had said in the prior quarter as we were -- in the prior quarters as we were implementing this strategy.","As you know, we're further down the road in the implementation and the content that we're bringing online. We're seeing the performance of that. We're even more confident in that guidance.","As Bob said in his prepared remarks, that MTV is going to be able to deliver a 60% increase in the delivery of their original hours at a cost that's less than what they were seeing in the prior year. So, no significant increase. It'll be -- it's purely a remixing and we're very happy with the results.","Robert Bakish","Yes and think of the remix as the remix of cross-brands, which is reflecting prioritization and a remix within brands that's reflecting type of programming.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","Robert Bakish","We'll take our next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. If you could provide a bit more color on your domestic advertising commentary for the September quarter. I think you said similar decline in the June quarter if I heard right.","I guess with the ratings improvement you saw in June and more notable improvements in July, some of the [Indiscernible] networks, I guess why would we see some more improvement? Is it the ad load reduction going to be more notable maybe in the September quarter? I guess if you can sort of fill-in the missing pieces there. And then any general commentary sort of on scatter and the overall marketplace would be great.","Robert Bakish","Yes, so let me start then Wade will chime in. There's a couple of pieces to the answer that question, although it ends with yes. Ad load reduction is an investment we're making in the health of our brands which we believe will pay strong dividends.","But going through it, we're coming out of an up front that we're very happy with. We have up volume. We've got a mid-singles rate of change or you could about it as CPM. Good demand across brands, so that's a nice foundation.","Scatter right now, we're actually very pleased with scatter. I'd say it's certainly a decent market. You look at MTV as an example and scatter is up double-digits. So, we don't see any issues with access to money. We also candidly have the benefit that we do have an ADU bank that were anything to weaken a bit, we can ride through it, but again, the scatter market continues to look good.","So, -- and we are -- we've seen ratings improvements and anticipate continuing to do so as additional new programming comes out. And when you look at October as the beginning of the fiscal, BET has a lot of programming coming; MTV, really through that -- today through them, a lot of programming coming.","We got Klepper coming to Comedy Central to create late-night power hour with Trevor. So, we do like how this is lining up, and we do believe that the will pay dividends in terms of reported audience performance.","However, our ad loads, in my opinion, were unhealthily high. And therefore we have taken this opportunity to use this rating growth to partially fund reduction in ad load. We think that's the right decision. But yes, that is -- and you heard Wade's commentary, if you adjust for that in the current or the third fiscal quarter just ended, we probably would have been around a plus one versus a minus two. So anyway, Wade -- you would add, Wade?","Wade Davis","That's exactly right. Think of it as really a three percentage point swing in terms of -- that's driven by the impression volume declines related to our deliberate decision to reduce unit loads. So, that deliberate decision is more than offsetting the impression volume gains that we get from our increased loads -- in our increased ratings.","Robert Bakish","That's just another revitalization step we needed to take given the hand we were dealt coming into this.","Alexia Quadrani","Sorry, I was going to say, does that headwind or that three percentage point swing stay consistent if we look forward in the next few quarters? I mean I'm trying to get a sense if the ratings continue to improve, despite that headwind, I would assume we would begin to see some sequential improvement, is that fair?","Wade Davis","No, it shouldn't -- I mean, it shouldn't continue.","Robert Bakish","The answer is the way you're thinking about it is fair that we should -- as we deliver additional audience gains, you will get that to flow through to the ad line. Again, we're looking at the next quarter; the services aren't fully where they need to be.","If you think of the arc of turning around, if you will, on television network that tends to be a kind of one year window from the time you start working on programming until you get critical mass on air. So, again, we're not there yet. We have more programming coming and over time, the ad performance will follow.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will comes come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. Let me just follow-up for ad load and then one for Wade on balance sheet. So, on the ad load, the question I have is what type of content -- which networks are you cutting the most and what are you seeing that on the C3 benefit from cutting it?","Wade Davis","BET has the highest ad loads across the house and we're seeing coming into this quarter some of the strongest ratings performance improvement at BET. So, that's a place that we're cleaning up.","But really across the house, we're using this opportunity to really walk that fine line of reaping some of the payback from the ratings gains to try and deliver a better experience for our consumers and our advertisers. So, it's really across the Board. BET is the biggest one -- and then I think you can also look at--.","Robert Bakish","I think MTV down, too.","Wade Davis","Yes, MTV. Those two are the biggest.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And Wade, you and Bob made great strides in reducing your leverage to focus on every call. You talked about being done your leverage by $2 billion this year. So, I have to ask you, given the reported rumors of a bid for scripts using cash, a lot of people were caught off-guard because everything you've done to delever.","So, can you talk a bit about your willingness to stay investment-grade as you look at deals? And if you're going to stay investment-grade, how is that deal going to be funded? Because we were sitting there kind of mystified, doing everything you've done so far to get back to lower debt ratios?","Wade Davis","Well, obviously, we're not going to comment on anything specific deal other than to say what we've said which is that we're going to -- to the extent that we're looking at M&A, which we believe is our obligation to our shareholders to do and to assess that we're going to be very disciplined in terms of how we think about delivering the right risk-adjusted return for our shareholders associated with any transaction.","And obviously, we're balancing and looking at any transaction. There's a number of factors you're going to look at. You're going to look at the pro forma operating performance of the OP entity, a big part of which you're going to adjust taste on point of view you have on synergies.","And then one of the things that we've demonstrated is our discipline around divesting non-core assets. And so it's possible that as we look forward to the strategic future of the company, we may take a different look at how we may free-up incremental capital from our asset base to potentially fund things that we think might be more strategic.","So, I can't -- again, every transaction is unique. I can't comment on -- it doesn't make sense, obviously, for me to comment on any specific transaction, most notably ones that are speculation.","But in general, we're focused on delivering shareholder value within the context of the priorities that we've laid out for folks and we're going to continue to be very disciplined around evaluating things through those lenses.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thanks Wade, thanks Bob.","Robert Bakish","And the other thing I would say just to add to that, -- excuse me, Mike, transaction may or may not happen. We feel we've got to look at it. At the same time, we feel very good about the asset base we own and the potential to create value and where -- that is the vast majority of our focus.","Operator","Rich Greenfield with BTIG has our next question. please go ahead.","Richard Greenfield","Hi, thanks for taking it. I've got a few questions. One, just on housekeeping. I think in the prepared remarks, you said domestic ad revenue. The trend is improving for fiscal Q4 versus fiscal Q3? I realize you're not saying whether it's up or down, but is it a continued improvement sequentially? Just want to clear that up.","And then two, your stock has lost my guess is over 20% of its value since the charter news broke last quarter. You had indicated at the time, I believe, Bob that this is not in keeping with the way you read your contract or at least your impressions of your contract. You haven't sued them yet. They've launched a new sports list bundle without Viacom channels.","Did [Indiscernible] and team screw-up the Charter contract, the legacy Charter contract? Is this going on litigation? And -- or is there a new deal imminently coming with Charter? I think it's had a huge outside impact on your overall stock and market cap. And then I've got the last follow-up after that.","Wade Davis","I'll take the ad sale piece.","Robert Bakish","Sure.","Wade Davis","So, yes, just on housekeeping, Rich, 2% decline this quarter, we think that the performance is going to be comparable in the next quarter, but it's important to underscore that we did say in my prepared remarks that the impact from the unit load reduction was comparable, right?","So, to the extent that we saw a three percentage point more or less impact from our deliberate decision to take those units out of the marketplace, that's going to be -- you're going to see very similar dynamic in the fourth quarter with the caveat that the ratings trend that we're seeing early in the fourth quarter are pacing ahead of what we're initially modeling.","Robert Bakish","Yes. And on the Charter question, so a couple of things. One is a strong point of view that they don't have the contractual right to tier our services in the way they have. We've obviously had that looked at by outside counsel, et cetera. So, we haven't changed our point of view on that, point one.","Point two is I really don't fundamentally believe suing big customers is the way to solve problems. I think the better way to solve it is through engagement and exploring ways that we can create value together, and that's what we're focused on.","Ultimately, I don't see this getting resolved in terms of the tiering until we get to any deal. And so this could take a little time. But rest assured, we're focused on it because we understand that it has caused some concerns, which in turn has likely affected the value of our stock. But again, we're focused on playing through that and ultimately getting to the right place with an important client.","Wade Davis","But to be clear, we're going to -- we are very focused on resolving this constructively given their importance as a client. But to the extent that we're not able to reach resolution, we are going to -- we will reserve the right to enforce.","Robert Bakish","Yes, that's right.","Richard Greenfield","And so just -- is there a timeframe you can give like your contract expires at the end of the fiscal year into the new fiscal year? And then just the larger point really for Bob. Obviously, we've had the discovery scripts transaction. Scale looks like it's becoming increasingly important as the sector matures, would you support the renewed merger with CBS if National Amusements chooses to pursue that path?","Robert Bakish","So, in terms of the Charter timing, look, we're not going to comment on that. You know that, we can't comment on that. And as far as a CBS-Viacom merger, that's really a decision of the Board, not myself as a CEO. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Jessica Wright with Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you. Just two divisional questions, I guess. Can you talk a little bit about of film, which in terms of upside, it's a smaller division, obviously, but otherwise could be very significant if you turn it around. Can you talk about some of the steps that Jim Gianopulos is taking to ensure a film turnaround?","And going back to some of these advertising comments that you made, you've made a number of deals, Altice, and you said you'll do other distributed deals and open [Indiscernible]. How quickly you think Sean Moran's group can really drive non-traditional advertising to the revenue play?","Robert Bakish","Yes. So, on the Paramount side, look, it starts with you need a plan. There's a plan for Paramount, which has to do what a slate going forward including the composition that is a significant component of branded films.","Then the plan enabling organization, which starts with leadership and there you've seen not only Jim, but now additional leadership reporting to Jim, Brian, et cetera. We have a great new television sales licensing Executive who came over from Disney. And so that's when you start going into execution.","And you're right there is a significant opportunity to turn around Paramount. Jim is certainly excited about that and focused on that and building a team to achieve that. In the interim, it's focusing on getting the most out of the assets we have. That can go to marketing that could go to, as I said, licensing, library sales, et cetera.","But it will be a material and really integral part of Viacom, both strategically and over time, financially. Worth noting that even with the existing slate and even with the underperformance of films like Transformers and Baywatch, we will have a nice year-to-year increase on the earnings side.","Wade Davis","The only thing I would add to that is I mean to the extent that your question was focused on actions that Jim has taken, so beyond charting a very well-defined slate strategy, beyond putting in place a world-class leadership team that can execute on supporting that slate strategy, just from a financial point of view, I'd just reiterate that we did take a restructuring charge this quarter that was reflective of Jim's strategy that included some -- cleaning out some development and programming that Jim didn't think was appropriate to carry forward and then was reflective of his strategy.","So, Jim's doing -- Jim and his team are doing a lot of great work, where nearly -- actually have been kind of the medium stages of 2018's budget and we're very happy with where that's shaping up and the progress that those guys have made.","Robert Bakish","Yes. And then on the ad sales side, a couple of comments. The advanced data, the vantage product is a real source of value for Sean and the team. And while we're through the probably -- 95% through, there's some small cleanup work to do on the up front, but that's a place where really budgets, if you will, are committed and we're still at the point then where you really turn them into actually actionable plans including how you incorporate some of these vantage products into their delivery.","Another point I would add and it goes to the value of some of this dynamic ad insertion that we've gotten, which includes not only Altice, but Comcast and are you're starting to have significant base of essentially inventory you can utilize.","And then if you look at a very large consumer products company from a marketing standpoint has recently indicated that they will use digital budgets to fund that kind of inventory because there's some differences in that inventory.","These are meaningful levers that Sean not only can, but will and is, pulling as we move forward in this ad market. And again, the fact that we are a scale player in the ad market, you see the benefit that we went very early on in the queue of people that were going, which was a good thing in terms of access to budgets.","And it's part of the story, just like, by the way, that what we're doing with the core brands, whether it's Paramount or MTV as part of the story, it's a multifaceted story, the one that has real value and has already delivered value.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everybody for joining us on our earnings call.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead sir. ","Jim Bombassei","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our September quarter and full year fiscal 2019 earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are, Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. We also have an accompanying slide presentation that you can follow along with our remarks. I want to refer you to the second slide in the presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","Before we begin, I want to note that due to the pending merger with CBS, we will not be providing forward-looking guidance for Viacom on today\u2019s call. During the February 2020 call for ViacomCBS, which will be the first call for the combined company, we will provide full year 2020 guidance. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Bakish","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Q4 was a strong quarter capping up a strong and pivotal year one where Viacom delivered on the ambitious plan we set out at the beginning of fiscal 2019, strengthening and growing the business for today, while accelerating the company\u2019s transformation for the future. ","Let me start off with a few of the headlines. As promised, we returned Paramount to full year profitability. We delivered full year growth in domestic ad sales and affiliate sales. We grew international media network\u2019s revenue on a constant currency basis despite macroeconomic issues in UK and Argentina. ","We used M&A as a transformational accelerant including importantly, acquiring, integrating and scaling Pluto TV, the leading ad supported streaming TV service. These are significant achievements, particularly in this dynamic media environment. What is perhaps most important is that all of this reflects the delivery of promises we made to you, our investor base.","So, let\u2019s break down the quarter and the year a little more. First, I want to highlight the success we\u2019ve had at Paramount. The studio was profitable for the first time in four years and OI improved by over $500 million in the last three years. We did this by improving execution across the board, putting in place a new balanced film plate strategy and by significantly ramping the TV business. ","Very importantly, it\u2019s again become a place where talent brings their best work and we are just getting going. While Gemini Man and Terminator, Dark Fate didn\u2019t perform as we hoped, our exposure was limited and we remain optimistic and excited about what the studio has coming including key franchises from our portfolio that we are bringing back for audiences. ","These include a Quiet Place 2 coming in March, a new SpongeBob movie expected in May and Top Gun: Maverick coming in June, which by the way looks amazing. ","And on the TV side, our studio business continues to thrive. During the year Paramount Television delivered hits like the third season of 13 Reasons Why, the second season of Jack Ryan, as well as debuts like Catch-22, Looking for Alaska and more. ","Moving to domestic media networks, Viacom maintains the number one share of U.S. basic cable viewing among key demos and our portfolio grew market share in the quarter and for the full year with strong results at MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount Network. ","In fact, in the quarter, we had the number one cable comedy telecast with South Park, the number 1 drama series with Yellowstone, the number 1 reality series with Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood, and the number 1 pre-school with Ryan\u2019s Mystery Playdate and that is just the tip of the iceberg. We had nine of the top-30 cable networks more than any other cable family.","More recently, in Q1 at BET, we launched Tyler Perry The Oval and Sistas. In fact, The Oval became the number one news series for African\/Americans 18 to 49 for cable and broadcast season today. Looking beyond Linear TV, in Q4, Viacom Digital Studios delivered its highest views ever on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. ","In fact, VDS drove year-over-year increases in Viacom\u2019s aggregate number of social video views and minutes by 38% and 75% respectively across all of our domestic, social accounts bringing their total social video views to 9.6 billion in the quarter. So, no question about it, our content continues to connect. ","Moving to domestic ad sales, thanks to the combination of our vibrant brand and strong ad sales execution including our sophisticated suite of Advanced Marketing Solutions, we delivered 6% ad growth, marking the second consecutive quarter of positive performance. Perhaps more important, we also delivered full year revenue growth for the first time in six years. ","This represents a significant milestone for Viacom and it\u2019s evidence of our transformation. In particular, the success of our Advanced Marketing Solutions business, where revenue grew 83% in the quarter and 76% for the full year, shows how we\u2019ve evolved the ad sales business to thrive even in the phase of linear impression constraints. ","Our ad sales strategy was built to enable sustainable growth in an evolving TV marketplace. In executing that strategy, we created and acquired a suite of products beyond the Pay TV ecosystem and it is working, evidenced by our strong domestic ad sales growth in the fiscal fourth quarter and returned to growth for the full year where AMS was an important driver. ","Looking forward, we expect continued growth, given the demonstrated power of the model, and our leadership position. Pluto TV is of course one of those strategic acquisitions and has quickly become an integral part of our AMS offering. Pluto TV continues to grow, expanding its leadership in the free streaming TV space, and its contribution to our ad sales growth. ","It now has approximately 20 million domestic monthly active users, a nearly 70% increase this calendar year-to-date. Our focus on an investment in Pluto is evident. In Q4 alone, Pluto launched 43 new channels and last month, Pluto Latino added 11 new channels given the platform of total 22 channels with over 4,000 hours of Spanish and Portuguese language programming. ","We also continue to grow Pluto TV distribution both globally and on new platforms, which benefits both our audiences, and our partners and Pluto has not only been a driver of our return to overall ad sales growth and it\u2019s also been a platform to enable Viacom to widen our ad sales business and radically increase the number of clients we do business with, which is a very good thing. ","In short, in the crowded subscription universe, as consumers become increasingly more value conscious, we strongly believe that having the leading free streaming service in the country and over time, the world is a huge competitive advantage. ","Turning to affiliate revenue, our growth in the quarter and full year demonstrate our strong execution in a challenging environment. Over the past few years, we have renewed or expanded almost all of Viacom\u2019s traditional subscriber base, gained inclusion on vMVPDs and announced mobile partnerships. ","Last quarter, we highlighted our distribution renewal with MCTC. Today, I am pleased to report that virtually all of the MCTC members opted into the agreement further demonstrating the strength of our brands. Over the past several years, we have implemented a distribution strategy to serve the widest addressable market. ","Our business today delivers and monetizes IP and content across all price points including MVPDs, VMVPDs, SVOD and free. Our dynamic affiliate strategy has led us to grow and demonstrated resilience, despite the macro trends within the industry. We believe persistent headwinds from subscriber trends and rates will continue to impact the business, which is why our multi-faceted approach is the right strategy going forward. ","On the Media Network Studio side, including Nick Studios, Awesomeness, MTV Studios and more, we have 17 domestic series order to or in production for third-parties, which is an impressive achievement for a business we created less than two years ago. ","Add the 26, we have a Paramount TV and we have a total of 43 shows in a rapidly growing TV studio business in the U.S. alone and this business continues to show strong momentum. ","For example, we got two new deals with Netflix. Just this week, Nickelodeon Studios announced the new multi-year output deal to produce original animated films and series, based on both Nick Library and brand new IP for kids and families around the world. ","I am also pleased to announce that Paramount has licensed the rights to Beverly Hills tops to Netflix, which will produce a new film based on an iconic IP, further expanding our relationship with this important original production client. ","In October, Comedy Central Productions and Trevor Noah signed an agreement to develop a comedy series for Quibi and we recently licensed South Park\u2019s domestic streaming rights to HBO Max, further demonstrating the appeal of our IP and our ability to maximize its value. ","We continue to broaden the business internationally as well. As an example, we now have almost 40 mobile deals live reaching 5 million subscribers. This is important early progress and we believe this segment will ramp significantly in the near-term. ","Finally, we said we\u2019ve made more out of our foothold in live events and we did just that with total event attendance growing to more than 4 million people in 2019. VidCon is a great example of how we are expanding our advanced franchises. ","When we first acquired it in early 2018, it was purely an Anaheim-based experience, but now, we have VidCon events in Australia, London, Mexico, Singapore, and the Middle East with more planned in the coming year. ","By leveraging Viacom\u2019s significant international operating footprint, VidCon is rapidly becoming a global brand. ","Now, before I turn it over, I want to take a minute and thank Wade for his relentless hard work and dedication to Viacom. Over the past 15 years, he has been a critical strategist and operator and over the last three years played an integral role in helping develop and successfully execute our strategy to evolve Viacom for the future. I am grateful for his many contributions and look forward to watching his future endeavors. ","With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Wade to provide some of the financial details. ","Wade Davis","Thanks. We\u2019ve had a fantastic run together and I really want to thank you for your friendship, your partnership, and your support. You and the rest of Viacom couldn\u2019t be better positioned for success going forward. ","Now getting into the numbers, as Bob just discussed, we ended the year as a standalone company on a high note delivering on our promise, returning Viacom to long-term sustainable growth. Paramount has had an amazing resurgence and delivered its first full year of profitability in four years. ","Worldwide Media Networks grew total revenue on a constant currency basis with both domestic ad sales and domestic affiliate revenue growing in the quarter and on a full year basis. ","The execution against our key growth initiatives in ad sales are driving the evolution of the company and are now at a scale that\u2019s fully offsetting headwinds in the linear business and will predictably deliver growth going forward. ","Over the course of the year, we invested in AMS to reinforce our leadership position in advanced advertising. We acquired Pluto TV establishing Viacom as the leader in free streaming TV in the U.S. and we expanded our suite of streaming offerings with the launch of BET+. We accomplished all of this, while continuing our focus on deleveraging the company and strengthening our balance sheet. ","The progress we have made over the course of the year is remarkable and lays an extraordinary foundation for the growth of ViacomCBS going forward. ","And turning to the results on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation where we have a summary of our consolidated performance. For the full year, on a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 1%, driven by growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. ","Adjusted diluted EPS grew for the third consecutive year. In the quarter, on a constant currency basis, total revenue was flat as growth at Media Networks was offset by a decline at Filmed Entertainment. ","Taking a closer look at the segments on Slide 11, I\u2019ll start with Filmed Entertainment. Paramount has delivered on its turnaround promise, returning to profitability on a full year basis for the first time since fiscal 2015. Adjusted OI improved $117 million versus a year ago and has improved in excess of $500 million over the last three years. ","Profitability for fiscal 2019 benefited from carryover profitability of the prior year film slate, increased monetization of the library and growth in TV production. ","In the quarter, revenue for Paramount declined 14%, while we saw strong growth in licensing revenue of 26% fueled by TV production, this was more than offset by a decline in theatrical revenue, reflecting the comparison to the release of Mission Impossible Fallout in the prior year quarter. ","Filmed Entertainment profitability in the quarter was $54 million, benefiting from profitability of the current year\u2019s slate, growth in TV production, increased monetization in the library, as well as disciplined cost management. ","Turning to Media Networks which is on Slide 12. My comments on Media Networks will be in constant currency terms. For detail on our reported results, please see our earnings release. Worldwide Media Network\u2019s revenue finished up 1% for the year driven by 1% worldwide advertising growth and 2% worldwide affiliate growth. ","For the quarter, Worldwide Media Network\u2019s revenue grew 6% capping a strong finish to the year. Adjusted operating income for the segment was down 5% to the year and 13% in the quarter, largely due to investments we are making in growth initiatives including Pluto TV, the launch of BET+, and the scaling of our AMS infrastructure. ","Moving to domestic ad sales, revenue finished up 1% for the year, benefiting from a return to growth in the back half, including a strong Q3 and Q4 with both quarters up 6%. The September quarter marked the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and the fourth quarter of sequential improvement excluding the timing impacts of Easter. ","Domestic ad sales benefited from strong AMS growth, which finished up 76% for the year, and up 83% in the quarter. AMS is enabling us to decouple our ad revenue performance from broader industry declines and linear capacity, setting us apart from our peers, and helping us now deliver industry-leading advertising revenue growth. ","AMS revenue accounted for 17% of full year domestic ad sales and over 20% of our fiscal fourth quarter domestic ad sales. The growth in AMS is being driven by Pluto where both audience growth and engagements are contributing to a massive pool of premium digital video inventory. ","Beyond Pluto, the core components of AMS are seeing continued momentum, as well, with Vantage, Addressable Media and Brand Solutions, all setting new records in the quarter. ","Now digging into more detail on Pluto, we worked quickly on the integration and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the performance. Pluto is growing rapidly fueled by expanding content offerings and distribution. Pluto launched 43 new channels in the quarter including the NFL channel and its own James Bond channel, Pluto TV 007, as well as 24 Viacom branded channels. ","And internationally, Pluto has expanded its content offering and device availability in the UK, Germany, Austria and Switzerland and will soon be made available in Latin America. ","Importantly, advertisers are increasingly embracing Pluto TV as evidenced by a very successful upfront, as well as having over 3500 brands advertising on the platform during the September quarter. In fact, in the month of September, Pluto registered its highest ever revenue month and total viewing minutes tripled over the prior year. ","We continue to see Pluto TV as a global opportunity including over $1 billion of ad sales in the U.S. alone, as we expand the content offering, grow audience and enhance monetization. Now moving to domestic affiliate revenue, revenue was up 1%, for both the full year and the quarter. Performance was driven by contractual rate increases, as well as OTT and studio production revenues which were partially offset by subscriber declines. ","On Slide 13 of the deck, we have an overview of International Media Networks. Total revenue finished the year up 2% with the quarter up 15%. International ad sales finished the year flat with the fourth quarter down 2%, solid performance in light of the ongoing macro headwinds in the UK. Outside of the UK, advertising revenue grew high-single-digits for the year including strong growth in Q4. ","Growth was driven by strength in Latin America, as well as event-driven spends. Looking at the ratings, Channel 5 achieved its fifth consecutive quarter of growth in viewership share and Telefe remained the number one network in ratings for 22 straight months. ","International affiliate revenue increased 8% for the year and 34% in the quarter benefiting from strong SVOD and OTT deliveries, expanding studio productions, and growth in linear. ","Turning back to the consolidated results, and looking at items below the line. Net interest expense was lower than a year ago by $7 million in the quarter and $71 million for the full year due to our deleveraging actions. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24% for the quarter and for the year. ","On Slide 14, there is a summary of our cash flow and debt. We delivered free cash flow of $1.4 billion for the year, which is down versus the prior year due to higher cash taxes and lower operating income. ","Moving to the balance sheet. At quarter end, we had $8.7 billion of gross debt outstanding, a reduction of 13% versus the prior year. Our adjusted gross debt reflecting the equity credit we received from S&P and Fitch on our hybrid securities was $8.1 billion. During the year, we repaid $1.4 billion of senior notes and debentures including $22 million that matured in September. ","Now before I turn it back to Bob for some closing remarks, I want to thank Shari and the rest of the Viacom Board for their support, their leadership and their vision. I also want to thank the investors and analysts on the call. It\u2019s been a privilege working with you all and you will be well served by the amazing combined ViacomCBS team that will be taking you forward. ","Bob Bakish","Thanks, Wade. I am extremely pleased with the performance we demonstrated during the quarter and for the year. 2019 caps off an intense, three year era of revitalization and transformation for Viacom. ","Our success reflects the combination of strategy and execution, of assets and people, of organic growth and M&A, and now we are beginning the next leg of our journey, one that is transformational, the merger of Viacom and CBS. At the center of it all is content. ","ViacomCBS will be a truly global, multiplatform, premium content powerhouse with tremendous assets and scale. ViacomCBS will be positioned to serve consumers, the creative community, commercial partners, employees and other constituents while creating significant value for shareholders. ","The strength and scale of ViacomCBS assets, which include one of the largest troves of IP in the world and production capabilities that are second to none, will enable us to pursue a growth strategy driven by one agenda to maximize the value of the content we create for our own platforms and for others. ","These distinct strengths, supported by our culture of content will make ViacomCBS one of just the handful of companies positioned to shape the future of the media industry. We will be well positioned to meet the increasing demand for premium content across the global distribution ecosystem. ","We will be a leader in the U.S. ad market. We will pursue expanded opportunities in distribution, including true streaming on a global basis and we will extend the use of our IP into important adjacent spaces. ","We anticipate that ViacomCBS merger closing in early December, but we already hard at work including having announced the bulk of the senior leadership team of the combined company, which is deep into integration planning as we speak. And this integration is not just about cost savings. At its core, it\u2019s also about extracting more value from our content assets. ","To that end, just this week, Pluto TV announced the launch of three new channels from CBS giving customers free access to live local news streams from CBSN, New York, CBSN Los Angeles, as well as a leading entertainment news streaming channel ET Live. This is just the taste of what to come once this deal closes in a few weeks. ","Overall, now that we will hit the ground running, unlocking synergies and opportunities as a combined company in the near-term. ","And with that, I would like to open it up to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Alexia Quadrani ","Thank you very much. Bob, understanding the deal hasn\u2019t closed quite yet, but can you please update us on your thinking of potential revenue synergies, now it\u2019s been several months since the plans \u2013 have gone through. Any - I guess, specifically, any potential positives to how we should think about potential benefits for affiliate revenues? And then I have a follow-up. ","Bob Bakish","Sure, Alexia. Look, we are now, as we said, deep into integration planning, building a detailed and actionable view of both revenue opportunities and cost synergies by the way associated with the combined company. That in turn is feeding into our action plan, our calendar 2020 budget and in shorter it will also lead to a multi-year LRP. ","Your specific question is on revenue synergies. That is ultimately the reason we did this deal. We believe there are substantial revenue opportunities in the combination. They are really our core areas to consider. First, was the one you name check distribution. Remember, on a combined basis, ViacomCBS delivers about 22% of U.S. Primetime TV viewing with a range of highly sought after content.","Today, we only receive about 11% share of the fees. We believe that reps has a significant going forward opportunity and we will have a combined cross-company affiliate sales force going after that we\u2019ve already announced leadership. ","Second area of synergy \u2013 revenue synergy is, U.S. advertising. As you know, we will have a market-leading position in linear across every demographic. We are the number one share player overall. We will be the number one player on every single demographic, combine that with the industry\u2019s leading Advanced Marketing Solutions platform, that will position us as the go to solution and problem solver for agencies and their clients and that in turn will allow us to grow share. ","The third area is content licensing. Here, we are uniting a Hollywood film slate with substantial TV production across multiple entities, whether that\u2019s CBS or Showtime or Viacom Media Networks or Paramount TV, that will allow us to create \u2013 have a single point of contact for a bundled offering which in turn will let us take a larger share of buyers\u2019 budgets globally. ","The last area, Streaming, again slightly different cattle of fish, but bringing the complementary content and platforms together to enhance our offerings and create this streaming ecosystem which crosses free and pay, we believe that\u2019s a tremendous opportunity. It will allow us to serve more consumers in freight and also allow us to upsell an evolving set of SVOD services starting with CBS All Access, Showtime OTT, BET+, Noggin and others. ","It\u2019s worth noting on that point that the Streaming sector is not only a revenue opportunity, but also one where we see opportunity in content investments as we make going-forward decisions to improve ROI and free cash flow conversion in that key sector of the business. Across all these four areas, clearly the domestic versus international mix will vary, but at least, with all have at least some global potential. ","Again, all of this will ultimately feed into our 2020 guidance, which as we indicated will be provided on our first combined company earnings call in February 2020. ","Alexia Quadrani ","And just one follow-up, Bob, you highlighted many good examples of success you are having in selling content to third-parties. I guess, either the new content, as well as library content. Can you walk us through how you evaluate what is best to be license or cap to support your growing portfolio of distribution channel?","Bob Bakish","Sure, At Viacom, and soon to be ViacomCBS, we have a tremendous library of IP and very significant production capacity across genres and formats really on a global basis. And that means, we have the ability to support our own platforms with compelling original content and supply third-parties and we can do both at scale. ","Now, let me give you a little more on how we think about IP and whether it flows in-house, or to third-party platforms, we really use a three-part framework to drive decision-making here at Viacom and going forward at ViacomCBS. ","First, clearly, we look at the direct financial consequences of a decision, we obviously think about the economic value of renting a piece of IP to a third-party for some period of time in the current marketplace and how that value can feed into the delivery of our overall financial plan. Simultaneously, we think about strategic considerations. ","We think about in that regard the potential for a piece of IP to be deployed in a manner to create other value. That might include the value of putting IP on an owned and operated platform to drive growth and value creation for that platform. It also could include the value of using the IP to drive other businesses. ","For example, using awareness, increased awareness of a piece of IP to drive businesses like consumer products, like recreation or potentially downstream feature film initiatives. ","And then the third thing we think about is partnership and specifically how the decision replaced the piece of IP could affect a broader relationship with a partner, those are typically in the distribution space, but in some cases, it could be in other spaces including the creative space as well. Importantly, this framework applies both to how we think about library usage, as well as new production. ","Alexia Quadrani ","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Please proceed with your question. ","Rich Greenfield ","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I just wanted to say, Wade, it\u2019s been amazing watching what you\u2019ve done. I guess, you are going to be missed at the new company. I think when you think about the Paramount turnaround, I don't know if it ever where it started without you and I think AMS strategy has put Viacom in a pretty interesting position relative to its peers. ","And obviously, Jim, you\u2019ve been through the trenches. I am going to miss you and your voices on these calls. But I wanted to get through a kind of a high-level question for Bob. That\u2019s really a follow-up on Alexia\u2019s, because, I am trying to understand the larger strategy of what you sell versus what you keep and it seems like you sort of have to pick a lane. ","The number one show on Disney Plus within the first 48 hours is the Simpsons. And so, kind of catalog content like that, like South Park obviously, I think, if South Park had been on CBS All Access, it probably would CBS All Access\u2019 number one show. And I don\u2019t have a problem with you selling South Park for big numbers or Nickelodeon content for big numbers, it\u2019s Netflix, I actually prefer that arms dealer strategy. ","But I am just trying to figure out, why even bother with CBS All Access, why bother with BET+? The street is obviously panicking or upset with what CBS has disclosed in terms of the level of the investment they are making in CBS All Access now relative to the ROI on that. ","And so, I am just trying to understand from your standpoint, don\u2019t you have to take a lane either arms dealer or your own SVOD strategy? Playing in both, isn't that going to kind of just make it \u2013 make life harder for you as a company? ","Bob Bakish","Yes, thanks, Rich. Look, you are right. We have a multi-part strategy. One which we believe \u2013 and this is at Viacom and this will be true for ViacomCBS, one which we believe allows us to unlock a range of opportunities in the shifting media landscape. So, as you know, we are planned in the linear TV and in the bundle, because that\u2019s still a massive business. ","It may be declining somewhat. But the majority of homes in U.S. continue to consumer media this way and with 20% of total, they view it on a combined company basis, number one positions in every demo, must watch content across a range of genres including sports, we are an extremely important partner of video distributors. ","So, of course, we don\u2019t want to pull away from that. We are going to continue to serve that market. We\u2019d be crazy not to. And as we do it, importantly, we see this as a segment where we can grow share and margins. And our strategy and operating plan is to do just that. ","At the same time, to your question on third-parties, demand for content from third-parties is incredible. And the combination of our assets and capabilities with the fact that some of our competitors are pulling back, makes this sector an enormous opportunity for ViacomCBS. As you know, we have deep libraries and extensive production capabilities at the moment. ","We have 750 series order to or in production, not to mention a library of over a 140,000 television episodes and over 3600 films. I strongly believe this level of volume is sufficient to supply both our needs and third-parties. So, why not access the revenue income and cash flow yields, your arms dealer point. ","And the upcoming merger with CBS and associated sales consolidation \u2013 consolidation of global product licensing will only enhance our position to extract value from that sector of the market. ","And then, finally, streaming. At Viacom, we have a real head start in both the free and niche pay spaces. Our ad-supported free TV streaming product Pluto is on an incredible growth trajectory as you\u2019ve heard. Monthly active users up 70% to 20 million calendar year-to-date. Total consumption growing faster that, monetization already in the hundreds of millions of dollars. ","Combine that with a partnership-driven, revshare-based model, which needs to be scale the cost of the business growth, versus deficit bundling content in advance of users and revenues. It\u2019s an incredible opportunity and of course, we are leading into it. Our niche SVOD businesses are really natural complements to our media networks. ","They leverage a common infrastructure, leverage programming, it\u2019s not large, but it\u2019s a nice incremental business. And so, you put all this together, we have the assets and capabilities including the financial resources to pursue all of them. And we think this balanced economy is the right way to create returns, and manage risks which creates substantial value over time. So, we like this strategy, Rich. ","Rich Greenfield ","That's really helpful. And could you just take one \u2013 or thirty seconds and just comment, Bob Iger announced on the last Disney earnings call that they are going to put content from FX several hours later on an unauthenticated HULU service. Just wondering whether you thought about taking content that\u2019s on your air in several hours later licensing it and whether it\u2019s just CBS All Access or whether putting it on Netflix or even HULU, whether that\u2019s something you\u2019d think about doing as well? ","Bob Bakish","So, we are in the middle of developing our combined company streaming strategy. As I said, that strategy will cross free, leveraging the tremendous head start we have with Pluto and Pluto, today, the last number I said, Pluto has 50,000 hours of content on it, 250 odd channels. ","We added many Viacom channels, but it\u2019s not just Viacom channels. You saw that this week we announced we are adding some more CBS channels. So, there is no question that the free segment of the market and the associated subset of consumers that participate in it, we think that\u2019s clearly a growth segment and we believe deploying our content and third-party content to that segment is a way to create a lot of value. ","Our deployment of content in that segment continues to be library value. So that\u2019s a way of getting more ROI out of assets we already own. That\u2019s certainly the road forward. And you know, vis-\u00e0-vis, time where it moves from one point to Pluto, that\u2019s something we continue to evaluate. But again, using pure Viacom library content with good distance from here today that\u2019s working very well for us. ","And again, we are tremendously excited about that. So I am not surprised that Iger wants to participate in a free space too. It\u2019s a big part of the market. And by the way, that market is partially people that are only using free and there is partially people that are using free as a compliment. ","We see a lot of complimentary use of Pluto, particularly in its on-the-go mobile configuration, which is a very high growth portion of the user base. ","Rich Greenfield ","Thanks. ","Jim Bombassei","Operator, we will take our next question. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Michelson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Doug Michelson ","Thanks so much. Bob, I wanted to continue on the Pluto path that you talked about it being the leading free streaming premium video service in the world. I was just curious, what\u2019s the competitive set from your point of view? Peacock is coming. There is going to be an ad component to HBO Max in 2021, YouTube and ROKU are out there. ","What do you have to do to differentiate Pluto into the future? It\u2019s obviously growing fast right now. But I am just curious if you sort of look forward and say that there is sort of an evolution of that product that we should be thinking about? And then, separately, I think you mentioned, Bob, a focus on free cash flow conversion on the content side of the house. ","Certainly, the S-4s that were issued had some working capital on the CBS side. That was well above the street over the next several years. But on the Viacom side, and Wade, I don\u2019t know, if you would jump in on this. Wade has been the working capital guru and you\u2019ve been ramping production of content without seeing a increase in working capital at least the last year or two. ","Any thoughts around the CBS working capital on the S-4? And whether we should consider that a guide for the combined company would be helpful. Thank you. ","Bob Bakish","Yes, let me start and then, Wade will add in. It will actually flip it. I am going to talk a little about this working capital piece and I want Wade to talk some more about Pluto. I am not going to comment directly on the CBS call in terms of their streaming content investment. And as I said, we are in the middle of integration planning, which includes forming a combined company operating plan and budget. ","That will obviously include the level of content investment across specific areas of the business including streaming and of course, it will feed our 2020 guidance. That said, let me give you some context from a Viacom perspective, with respect to content investment and streaming, there is a few things I would highlight. ","First, a key objective of the Viacom streaming strategy has been differentiation. That in turn led us to launching niche services based on our brand, targeting our specialized audiences and here as you know, we have an expanding portfolio. It also led us to the free ad-supported TV space, where we now have the industry-leading offering. ","As we pursued differentiation, we also focused on the development of a capital-efficient model. For example, on the niche SVOD side, our services are overwhelmingly based on the use of library, versus original need for SVOD content. And that radically improved the economics. Where we do have original made-for-SVOD content, which is BET+, we\u2019ve done that in a partnership model. ","In this case, with Tyler Perry, which has enabled advantaged economics in terms of access to his library, as well as his original production. On Pluto TV, we have a different path to capital efficiency. Pluto TV model is based overwhelmingly on revshare-based content partnerships, which as I said, allows us to scale expenses as the business grows, versus investing significantly ahead of user growth and ad revenue. ","And that creates a much more attractive financial envelope or candidly we are not losing billions and billions of dollars for a number of years. In addition, we have deployed Viacom library asset versus new production as a key content source again, producing attractive financial returns. ","As we move forward with the combined Viacom and CBS including in the streaming space, differentiation and capital-efficiency will be key considerations. And the good news is, we believe the combined company, the content asset base, as well as existing mix of free and paid services are really powerful levers in that regard. And Wade, why don\u2019t you talk a bit more about Pluto?","Wade Davis","Yes, the only other thing I would add on cash flow, Bob is just, we have seen for quite some time and we will continue to see the Viacom businesses. Some of the highest rates of free cash flow conversion in the industry. ","You would see a little bit of a decline in this year \u2013 in the fiscal year, that was not really so much a function of working capital utilization as it was just lapping cash taxes from prior year tax reforms. As you know, there is some lumpy \u2013 when you are in the film business, because just the timing of when the production and the release of a films come, there is some lumpiness to working capital consumption that is derived from the film business specifically. But in general, the working capital characteristics of the Viacom businesses are going to continue to be leaders in free cash flow conversion. ","With respect to Pluto, and its competitive positioning, I guess, what I would say is, let\u2019s kind of break it down into two, its competitive positioning versus those in the market today and competitive positioning versus those that aspire to be in the market at some point in the future perhaps. ","With respect to the folks that are in the market today, Pluto is the definitive market leader. So, I guess, I would just say, its differentiation vis-\u00e0-vis the existing competitors speaks for itself. ","With respect to the people who might enter the market at some point in the future, we will see, but we are confident of Pluto\u2019s ability to maintain its market leadership for a number of reasons. I guess, I\u2019d focus probably on four, the product differentiation, its distribution approach, its content, and then, ultimately, how that ladders up into its business model. ","So, from a product differentiation standpoint, Pluto has pursued a unique product approach, one that\u2019s linear first. That\u2019s a great familiar lean back experience. That\u2019s a front door to VOD whereas most people have focused on a VOD first experience. Second, from a distribution standpoint, I mean, there are some folks like ROKU who are doing really, really well with their free products. ","But their constraints are only being on their own O&O platform. Pluto's differentiating itself by being really everywhere. People who are going to be coming to the market, of course, everybody is going to be on the on the big three or four platforms. ","But one of the things Pluto has an extraordinary lead on is that, for years, we have been working on the long tail of distribution, particularly having the Pluto service embedded in devices that sit in the living room. ","So, the fact that we have been able to get embedded distribution on the world\u2019s largest connected television platforms in a very differentiated way is something that\u2019s going to serve us well as a big lead. People can do that over time, but it takes years to get that level of penetration. ","The third thing is just the content scope. So, we have an incredible content offering on Pluto. There is over 260 channels in the aggregate, that\u2019s 50,000 hours of content across the genres that people care about like news, sports, weather, movies, entertainment, kids. ","And then, the last thing, as we said just ladders up into the business model. So, this is a platform. It's a platform that benefits all partners. The cost structure is overwhelmingly variable since it\u2019s on a revshare basis, we are able to sustain and refresh those 50,000 hours of content without losing billions of dollars a year. ","So, those are \u2013 I\u2019d say, probably the four big points to keep in mind as it relates to why we believe Pluto is going to continue to be the market leader in free. ","Doug Michelson ","Super helpful, both of you, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. ","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. I have two, maybe one for Wade and one for Bob. So, Wade, on the Paramount side, given the ramping you guys have done in original TV and films, talk a bit about what\u2019s the ROI frameworks that you put in place to think about maybe payback period? And what type of thresholds do you need before you put something green light?","And then, for Bob, now you turned to profitability at Paramount, my next question would be, where is kind of the normal resting profitability? Look back at history, it\u2019s been higher than here, obviously, but do you think the business mix has changed enough that we could see perhaps a new level of peak profitability at Paramount into the future given the higher investment made in TV. So, those are my two questions ","Wade Davis","So, I\u2019ll start on the Paramount, your question is on Paramount TV in particular and ROI?","Michael Nathanson","Yes, TV and film ROI. How do you manage ROI","Wade Davis","Well, I would \u2013 on the TV piece it\u2019s very important to remember how we\u2019ve built the television business at Paramount, which is we have taken a very, very capital-efficient approach to getting into the television business, in which we really mine the vast library of IP. We leveraged that into a leadership position in premium scripted. ","But, because we are doing that in partnership with our customers, principally, they are underwriting the cost of that and we are taking our fees on top of them underwriting the cost. And that has a lot of strategic benefits, but from an ROI standpoint, it\u2019s an infinite ROI, right? ","All we are doing is, we are underwriting the overheads and then, the volume of production that we have been building is largely been on a cost plus basis. That\u2019s an important thing for us strategically. So first, it allows us, although we are licensing to those customers the first window of this product, we are building the long-term library value of Paramount. ","Second, by building out a real scaled television business, next to the studio, the film studio which hadn\u2019t had one, since the split of ViacomCBS, we are really able to leverage our distribution power and ultimately, having distribution power combined across film and TV is one of the things that\u2019s allowed us as you\u2019ve seen to really increase dramatically how efficiently we are monetizing the film library. ","And then, as it relates to the film business, there is not such a clear answer to ROI threshold, because as Bob said before about how we think about the returns on the content creation, franchise management, we are really looking at this holistically. ","Some films like the SpongeBob film, we might actually on the pure underwriting of that, but filming that film alone, except the relatively lower threshold although in that case we didn\u2019t think that film is going to be an extraordinary piece of business on a film. But we really think about the broader ecosystem and how we can underwrite our franchise content to grow throughout our ecosystem. ","Bob Bakish","Yes, and look, stepping back and thinking about Paramount bigger picture, you\u2019ve seen the market where we got to from 2016 to 2019 and we think 19 is a really important milestone in our journey to move Paramount back to and to your point, beyond historical profitability levels. We look at 2020 and we are excited about what\u2019s going on. ","You got Quiet Place 2 coming, you got the Sonic film that we dropped the trailer on this week that created a bunch of excitement, you got SpongeBob, you got the Top Gun sequel that everyone's waiting for. We continue to manage risk. So we got 40% - about 40% of the slate co-financed, which we think is important. ","And we like what we are seeing at Paramount TV as well. We mentioned 26 shows order to or in production, pipeline of other properties that are already in development. And given all the activity in the streaming world, we don\u2019t expect that demand to slow down anytime soon. So, you look forward, we\u2019ll continue to ramp volume. ","We clearly see growth in theatrical business serving streamers is another business. TV production is a business, taken that IP and doing more and more within in the recreation space is something else for us too. As you think about Paramount in the context of ViacomCBS, a way to create additional value out of that bundle is \u2013 out of that collection of Paramount asset is through bundled sales and we talked a bit about that on the global product licensing. ","We think that\u2019s a material share opportunity. Also Paramount\u2019s access to our owned and operated platforms whether that\u2019s in the television space, the premium space, the streaming space and also Paramount is part of a ViacomCBS which is undergoing cost transformation and the benefit of scale, whether that\u2019s in terms of support services, whether that\u2019s in the form of sourcing, et cetera. ","All of that contributes to growth in revenue and also our ability to improve margins and really take this business to the next level, so to speak. And I think it\u2019s important to note that as we do this, this is really a unique asset. This is one of the few iconic motion picture and television studios in the world. There are few of them today than there were in the past. ","The library is truly irreplaceable and you saw the benefit of us continuing to improve monetization of that in 2019. Tremendous demand for that product. So, this is an asset that we love to own, that we love the momentum we are seeing. We take the pain. It\u2019s executing well and the road ahead is extremely exciting. ","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thanks, Bob and best to you, Wade. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. ","Marci Ryvicker ","Thanks. I have two. The first, and this may be premature, but how does the NFL factor into Viacom\u2019s decision regarding content investment, if at all? Number one, and then, number two, it sounds like you are sharing some of the economics on the TV production side. ","So, I guess, I just want you to clarify that that is correct. And then, second, correlated to that, what percent of what you produced in television do you tend to own?","Bob Bakish","I don\u2019t understand your second. What \u2013 when you say, we are sharing some of the economics of TV production, and you could be a little more specific as to your question. ","Marci Ryvicker ","I guess, with regards to Wade\u2019s comments, the underlying, do you own a 100% of the series that you produce on the TV side?","Wade Davis","Why don\u2019t I just clarify? ","Bob Bakish","Yes, go ahead. ","Wade Davis","And then, you can take the NFL. Generally speaking, we own the IP and the majority of the business that we have been doing historically on the television side is that, we are selling to a customer the project. And so that customer, whether it\u2019s Netflix or HULU or Showtime, they are underwriting \u2013 we are doing that business on a cost plus basis and they own a window of that content. ","So, they are ordering the show. We are agreeing on a budget. They are underwriting the budget and they are paying us that budget plus, call it, 20%. They own the show for a certain \u2013 either a certain window of time, a certain geography, the rights on a certain platform. We can then exploit the rights that they don\u2019t own. And then, in the longer term, the negative and the associated IP reverts back to us. ","Does that answer your question, Marci?","Marci Ryvicker ","Yes. ","Wade Davis","Okay. Great. And NFL, Bob?","Bob Bakish","Yes, by the way, I would use the word rent, not own. We just \u2013 we tend not to sell property in the model that Wade just described. It\u2019s really a rental for a term. We ultimately own the IP and can remonetize it over time. ","To your question on the NFL, well, the NFL is a world-class brand. It\u2019s important to certainly American video consumers. We have \u2013 at CBS, a very longstanding and highly productive partnership with league and the teams. As we look to the NFL, we think the NFL is important going forward. ","We \u2013 and when you think about ultimately, an NFL renewal, and it\u2019s still little ways away, if you think from my conversations with people at the leagues as well as people at CBS, the NFL clearly values and continues to value broadcast reach. ","Why do they do that? Because they got a mass market brand and there is a well understood consumption habit of people sitting around and watching Sunday football on their television through broadcast feeds. They want to continue to have a mass market business and broadcast is mass market reach. So that\u2019s clearly important to them. ","The second thing that people don't talk so much about is, super high-quality production. CBS actually produces many games every week for the NFL. This is live sports, multi-camera, dynamic production, and it\u2019s the way that the American public and some places the world sees the NFL product. ","That is very important to the league. And again they trust CBS is able to do that at the highest level. You shouldn\u2019t underestimate the value of that. ","As you look forward and Viacom enters the equation, there is two other things that we bring to the table in the context of the NFL. One is younger audiences. Whether it\u2019s through our linear feeds or on-demand products like Pluto, we serve significantly younger audiences than CBS and in a league that once to have a long-term brand, they need to bring young audiences and get them excited with the game, et cetera. And the Viacom assets are clearly additive to doing so. I have had those conversations.","The second thing, also that gets to longer-term brand development and growth for the NFL is international. Clearly, Viacom has one of the strongest international operating portfolios in media including broadcast, CBS-like, if you will access in markets outside the United States, as well as a pay bouquet that reaches over 170 countries. ","So \u2013 and again, if you are developing a brand long-term, you got to develop your business outside the United States and we are additive there. So, I look at that and say the NFL is important to us as ViacomCBS. We\u2019ve had a great partnership. We bring more to the table on a combined basis than CBS alone historically. And sure, they are going to want a bigger check, but I am confident that we\u2019ll have a strong partnership for many years to come. ","Jim Bombassei","Operator, we have time for one more question. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jessica-Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Jessica-Reif Ehrlich ","Thank you. I have follow-ups to two topics, revenue synergy and Paramount. On the revenue synergy, I guess, it\u2019s like a two-parter. But can you talk a little bit about the timing on distribution CBS said on their call that 50% of their retrans deals come up in the next year. I think YouTube comes up by year-end this year. ","Would you be \u2013 how will you be able to benefit? Or any of your deals co-terminus? And on advertising, can you talk a little bit about your approach to the upfront, but more generally maybe the advertising community, because you have such a broad platform of networks now, both linear and digital. ","And so much premium content is going to non-advertising platforms, meaning subscription-only. It just seems like a really great opportunity. ","And then on the Paramount side, you\u2019ve had such an impressive turnarounds under Jim Gianopulos, which is I guess not so surprising given his history of managing the business at Fox. But he has done a great job and he talked about the opportunities of scaling up both in film and television. ","Maybe, could you address some of the challenges? The home video market seems \u2013 how do you replace a market that is clearly in decline? And have you had any pushback from China, like \u2013 or is there any pushback from the recent trade issues? Thank you. ","Bob Bakish","Sure, Jessica. Well have packed in there. So, let\u2019s try to tick through it pretty quickly. First, on your distribution question, the combined company, we do have \u2013 first point, we are in the middle of creating a combined company sales force serving MVPDs and vMVPDs here in the U.S. race and lead that and we are - like I say, creating a combined company team. We are going to go to market on that post close. ","There are deals in 2020 that are, we believe actionable. And so, we continue to think that\u2019s an opportunity. We do ultimately believe that the realization of that opportunity is not all in 2020. This will take some time to play out, but nonetheless, I am excited about it. ","And I think, we really have a very important position in this ecosystem, given the breadth of our content, the audience shares et cetera and there is no question that that\u2019s a revenue synergy. ","On the ad side, as you said, we have a tremendous opportunity here. If you look at what Viacom did in the last upfront, where we combined the Viacom portfolio of networks with Advanced Marketing Solutions including Viacom Video and Pluto, doing things like taking our 18 to 34 reach from low 40s with our linear networks, high 40s with Pluto, 90 with Viacom Video, bringing that to market in a package to help get advertisers more reach, without frequency cap problem and help them manage inflation. ","That was compelling every agency in the industry signed up for it. And as you know, we had a very strong upfront. ViacomCBS is that on steroids. We will be definitive problem-solver for the industry and the first port of call almost without a doubt. And look, U.S. ad impressions, U.S. ad delivery for products and services companies is very important. ","The market is complicated given what\u2019s going in TV ecosystem. That\u2019s why our portfolio of solutions which spans linear television, and other forms of video including by the way, branded content is so important and we are clearly ahead of the industry. And you see it in the strength of the market. Pricing and demand remains very strong. ","It was strong in the upfront, it\u2019s strong in current days scatter, 30 plus percent premiums versus the upfront teens premium scatter-to-scatter. This is a strong market and we are really looking forward under Jo Ann Ross' and John Halley's leadership, to serving it. So, that\u2019s a great opportunity ahead. Again, you will see that play out and create value in 2020. ","On the Paramount side, there is challenges, sure. But, you see demand ramping from streamers, whether that\u2019s in the television series space or that\u2019s in the film-length space, that's a good growth segment in some respects, that is the new home video. We have a longer term opportunity probably in the PVOD space. ","That's something that hasn\u2019t come to market yet and clearly ViacomCBS, given its ownership of Paramount combined with its relationships with all the distribution in the United States is ideally positioned for that should we choose to go down that path. ","On China, it\u2019s a market we watch. Thankfully we haven\u2019t had any issues. And look, our product resonates there. So, net-net, we are very excited. I am very excited about the revenue opportunities associated with the ViacomCBS combination across a whole range of areas. And as you heard, very, very excited about what\u2019s going on at Paramount. ","Jessica-Reif Ehrlich ","Thank you.","Bob Bakish","In closing, I just wanted to say, we are really proud of Viacom\u2019s accomplishments and evolution over the past few years and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s next. As we get ready to embark on it, know that the ViacomCBS management team will be transparent. We will be accessible. We will lay out a clear plan and we will update you on our progress along the way. ","Lastly, I\u2019d like to offer my thanks on behalf of the Viacom management team to two important groups. First, the Viacom employees for their dedication and relentless execution over the last three years. It\u2019s your hard work that has set us up for this next exciting chapter. And second to you, our investor base. I want to thank all of you for your continued support and partnership and we look forward to the road ahead.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our September quarter earnings call. Listening from Los Angeles is our Chairman, Sumner Redstone, and joining us in New York are Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page number two in the Web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Philippe.","Philippe Dauman","Thanks Jim and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2015's fourth quarter and full fiscal year.","We are seeing real progress as the ecosystem adapts and coalesces around innovative new models both in distribution and advertising in the U.S. and around the world. We believe these changes will usher in a new period of prosperity and growth, but also know that success will require a focus on a long-term health and vitality of our business.","More than ever, this is a great time to be in the content business and those with a more long-term view that is currently in vogue will be richly rewarded. Viacom continue to take a leadership role in capturing the opportunities that are rapidly taking shape. We are effectively adapting to a digital on-demand socially driven global marketplace even as we demonstrate quantifiable success in achieving our strategy goals. Importantly, we are also accelerating the critical initiatives that are driving improvements throughout the company.","First, I will recap our financial performance in the quarter and the year and share some operational and strategic highlights. Tom and Wade will go to greater detail on the results in a moment.","In the fourth quarter, revenues declined 5% to $3.79 billion, adjusted operating income was $1.06 billion and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $614 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 10% to a $1.54 per diluted share. For the year, revenues were $13.27 billion a decline of 4%. Adjusted operating income totaled $3.92 billion and adjusted net earnings from continuing operation were $2.21 billion. Full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1% to $5.44, which was an all time record for the company.","Viacom continue to generate substantial free cash and return $2.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2015 through share repurchases and dividends. As planned, we resumed share repurchases last month at a relatively modest pace thus far, as we focused on growth initiatives while maintaining a strong financial position.","Looking back at the quarter and the full-year Viacom continue to execute on our top strategic priority, investing in content especially original content for all technologies, building international scale capabilities and profitability and expanding the use of data and technology in advertising, distribution and the viewer experience to derive additional value from our brands.","As I said earlier, our industry has been moving through a period that has challenged established patterns of media consumption and measurement of that consumption, because of our young audiences and highly focused brands, Viacom experienced the changes early in the cycle and across more of our properties than other media companies.","That transition has now taken a hold across the industry, creating disruption, but also spurring action and real momentum towards solution. As the early birds, we see that as platforms expand and opportunities increase fully measured consumption becomes even stronger. In fact, recent research revealed that young people are spending more time consuming media each day than they do sleeping. So apparently, media executives aren\u2019t the only ones losing sleep in this modern world.","I'm pleased to say that at Viacom we are starting to turn the corner. Once again, in the quarter the Viacom family of networks was number one according to Nielsen for people two plus, people 18 to 34, people 18 to 49 and people 2 to 49 that's a lot of people. Ratings are improving at key networks like Nickelodeon, Nick at Night, TV land, BET, CMT and VH1 with additional improvement expected at our other networks as new programming kicks in.","Our investment in data is producing meaningful, incremental revenue and the benefits of digital distribution continue to develop and grow. As other companies now begin their pivot through the transition, many of our media networks brands are already beginning to emerge, well positioned to grow and succeed.","Turning to the media networks result, revenues increased 5% to $2.79 billion in the quarter, affiliate revenues remain strong up 15% domestically and 10% worldwide in the quarter. For the year, domestic displayed revenues increased 8% and worldwide revenues were up 5%. We expect continued high single-digit growth in domestic affiliate revenue in fiscal 2016.","With the renewal of our AT&T agreement at the end of the quarter, we concluded a year in which we successfully renewed affiliate deals covering close to 20% of our distribution. In addition, we closed an unprecedented Hulu deal in September that provides outstanding value for our programming while supporting the vitality of the overall distribution ecosystem.","On the advertising sales front, we delivered sequential improvement in quarterly domestic advertising revenue growth with a decline of 7% improved from a 9% decline in Q3. While it is still early in the quarter, we expect continuing improvement in domestic ad sales this quarter which we expect to accelerate further as our fiscal year progresses. Worldwide, the decline in the fourth quarter was 1%, for the year, worldwide advertising revenues increased 1%.","Once again, advertising revenues substantially outpaced traditional rating as we continue to provide significant value-added offering to marketing partners and we continue to deepen our value proposition to partners offering deep social connection to our Viacom Echo platform. A key component of Viacom's next generation advertising portfolio is Vantage, our bet on sophisticated data that leverages our leadership in analytics and data aggregation for the benefit of marketing partners. It is a proven success and a platform that is in great demand among the largest and most sophisticated advertisers.","Currently, we have 11 advertisers using Vantage, leading national advertisers across sectors that include automotive, beverages, consumer goods, financial services and quick service restaurants. We are in discussions with dozens of additional Fortune 500 partners. Demand is strong and building. We anticipate that we will triple the total number of Vantage deals by next year's upfront representing a significant portion of our advertising revenue base.","Many of our peers are beginning their own data program, the market is moving rapidly in this direction led by sophisticated national advertisers, this is good for the ecosystem and will create more demand. We are confident that Viacom will remain in the forefront as we continue to evolve and improve our proprietary products. Our brands remain powerful, our creative and technical talent is unmatched and our exclusive relationships cannot be replicated like the TiVo partnership we announced just last week.","In addition, we have in the last few weeks taking a significant ownership stake in DigiTour, a leading live events provider for social media talent with many partnership opportunities across our brands. We are deeply committed to keeping our leadership in this area and firmly believe that as others catch up, we will already be executing on the next generation of these high margin, highly sophisticated programs for our marketing partners.","Of course all of this continued improvement depends on great content and our Neo networks are delivering more new original programming than ever before for every class. Nickelodeon is a prime example of the success of this commitment. The network delivered a strong fourth quarter by launching innovative new shows and increasing the volume of high quality premiers. Throughout the quarter, Nickelodeon had more than a 100 new episodes of preschool and kid content with positive results.","Paw Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines are preschool hits with live-plus-three ratings for premiers exceeding a 10. Saturday nights, now host two new hits, Henry Danger which was the number one live action show for kids 2 to 11 in the fourth quarter and Game Shakers, which has become a number one live action show in recent weeks. Game Shakers also plays cross platform with its Sky Whale game already generating 3 million downloads since its September launch.","August marked Nick's highest rated month of the year with kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11. By September, Nick had taken a strong lead over its nearest competitor and has continued that trend into the current where Nickelodeon will premier 140 new episodes and event programs in the Hard Eight.","In digital, the Nick Jr. app and Noggin are all expanding their reach. The Nick has surpassed has surpassed 20 million installed across iOS, Android, Xbox and Roku and the Nick Jr. app has surpassed 2 million installs with kids spending over 100 minutes per week within the app. Noggin continues to perform well and will be available on android and internationally for the first time beginning next week.","VH1 is another success story, with new leadership in place the network increased total day ratings 6% over the fourth quarter 2014 driven by its strong Monday lineup. For the quarter VH1 was the number one cable network on Monday nights among women 18 to 49 and number three among all adults 18 to 49 fueled by the Love & Hip Hop Franchise.","The Season 4 Finale of VH1\u2019s Love and Hip Hop at lined up was the number one telecast on all television for the day among women 18 to 49 and women 18 to 34. The episode was also the number one cable telecast among adults 18 to 49 delivering a 2.3 rating in that demo and over 3.3 million total viewers.","And combined with the evenings two encore airings more than 5.3 million total viewers tuned in for the Season 4 Finale. In the current quarter, VH1 is continuing to roll with October prime time ratings up 33%. VH1 owns Monday nights as the number one non-sport cable network for women 18 to 49.","BET delivered sequential improvement in ratings growth in the fourth quarter with a top two sitcoms on all basic cable for the key 18 to 49 demo, The Game and Real Husbands of Hollywood and the network delivered on their all new reboot of the classic MTV series Punk'd making it the third highest rated BET series in the quarter.","In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, BET is driving even more ratings growth, quickly bringing more quality and more volume to the schedule. The Being Mary Jane season three premier was Tuesday night top scripted program on cable this season among adults 18 to 49 and the Westbrook's is already becoming a new reality hit.","We are also looking forward to Centric's Soul Train Awards at the end of this month which is a proven viewership tempo and much like the widely successful BET experience the Soul Train Awards continues to build a scale of its weekend long live event, reinforcing connections with fans and creating unprecedented marketing opportunities for our advertising partners.","At MTV we've also installed new leadership, Sean Atkins joined us in October, he is an accomplished, versatile media executive who brings excellent management skills and creative experience across developing low cost development, production and digital products. He has hit the ground running and we expect to see significant improvement at MTV in fiscal 2016.","Despite traditional rating challenges, the MTV brand maintains its prowess and vitality, engaging with young audience in more and deeper ways than ever. The recent Video Music Awards is a great example, the show attracted 10 million viewers on air and more than 76 million video views across platforms in the first three days including 12 million views on Snapchat. This show had generated over 0.5 billion social impressions and also set a new record for Tweets during an entertainment program.","To kick off our second fiscal quarter MTV is returning some of its biggest hits and bring highly anticipated new series to air including new seasons of Teen Mom OG and Teen Wolf as well as the epic fantasy drama The Shannara Chronicles. Comedy Central also had a quarter successes that illustrate it's continued vibrancy as the home of fresh comedy talent and ever more engaging programming.","The network had its most successful any season ever with 26 dominations and eight wins the third most wins of any network. We couldn\u2019t be prouder of their achievements and the validation of the networks position at the center of the comedy zeitgeist. Comedy Central remains the destination for the most intriguing comic months and has consistently pushed envelope to create programming that drives culture and explore some digital platforms among it's dedicated fans.","While traditional ranting soften in the quarter, the networks\u2019 home grown hits like Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City, South Park, Drunk History and Tosh.0 continues to drive substantial gains on well monetized digital platforms like Hulu on the Comedy Central app. Comedy will see improvement in traditional ratings with upcoming new programs and schedule changes, and will be a big beneficiary as more complete and accurate measurement takes hold.","The network also successfully relaunched the Daily Show in September with new host Trevor Noah. Trevor has exceeded our expectations and has already built an audience that is younger, more digital and more diverse. Over the first four weeks, Trevor grew linear viewing among adults 18 to 24 by 20% and men 18 to 24 by 32% and the program remains the number one late night show in all the television with those audiences. In addition, the Daily Show is now averaging 750,000 digital full episode views per show over and above the traditional measurement totals.","Looking to the fiscal quarter the Comedy Central pipeline is full with 10 original series on the schedule including Idiotsitter a scripted series starting Charlotte Newhouse and Jillian Bell a fan favorite from Workaholics, as well as new but multiplatform series Not Safe with Nikki Glaser. We are seeing additional improvement across our portfolio, the recently completed Spike series Ink Master posted the highest C3 ratings in its history up 14% from the prior season and I love Kellie Pickler got off to a terrific start in CMT last week posting triple-digit ratings gains for the channel in its time slot.","As we have discussed in the past, we are hyper focused on building upon our industry leading footprint outside of the U.S. no other media company can match the breadth of Viacom's international network brand or broad geographic reach. We intend to push our advantage, in that regards, fiscal 2015 was a landmark year with the full integration of Channel 5 into our operations and the launch of 21 channels around the world including seven in the fourth quarter.","Also on the quarter, Viacom International Media Networks launched Viacom Play Plex a global suite of brand as mobile apps designed to complement our linear TV channels and allow our distribution partners to deepen and improve the entertainment experience they offer their subscribers. Consistent with the TV Everywhere products we offer in the U.S. these apps will be available on all 180 markets we operate in. We believe no other international entertainment companies offering this type of innovation at this scale serving every major demographic in every major TV market.","In the last month, Viacom International Media Networks held the EMAs our largest international music tempo of the year. TV viewership remains strong for the show around the globe and digital video views exploded by 340% over the last year. We also had an impressive 300 million social mentions and hash tag MTV EMA was the number one worldwide trending Twitter topic on the night of the show.","At the studio, Paramount delivered one of the top five movies of the summer in Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. Once again, Tom Cruise performed at a superstar level at the Box office in the U.S. and particularly overseas where we drew more than 70% of the sales revenue. Paramount\u2019s ability to produce and market films is stronger than ever, but we simply did not have enough films in the pipeline this year to take full advantage of our capabilities.","In fiscal 2016, we have committed to returning Paramount to a full 15-film slate. In addition, Paramount Animation has a number of exciting projects on tap including the Little Prince which it's video will release next March. Paramount\u2019s Animation team is also currently in production on Monster Trucks, Sherlock Gnomes, SpongeBob SquarePants 3 and Amusement Park.","With three new shows set for early next year including School of Rock on Nickelodeon, Greece Live on FA and Vital on HBO, Paramount Television continues to expand and demonstrate its creative approach to developing and producing Television and entertainment. The division is also growing into original programming slate and a distinguish roster of creative partners.","Most recently announcing a straight to series order with Netflix for 13 Reasons Why being executive produced by Selena Gomez and an overall television deal with Emmy award winning director Cary Fukunaga. To-date Paramount Television has 10 shows ordered to production and an additional 12 projects set up at networks in major digital outlets.","In closing, we are optimistic about the state of our industry and the significant opportunities Viacom has to benefit from changes in technology, consumption and the growing international marketplace. As we move through 2016, we are committed to tripling our roster of Vantage clients leading into the 2016 upfront, rolling out more original programming across the company at an unprecedented level in our history, improving the scale and profitability in our international media networks group, driving Paramount to significantly improve financial performance in the years ahead by returning to theatrical slate of 15-films per year, together with a continuing build up of our television production and animation activity.","2016 will be a significant year as measurement and monetization come into realignment around sophisticated data enhance programs that we are pioneering. The application of data insights will lead to more and more differentiation in technology driven advertising. Consumption will continue to expand across all platforms and international markets represent new and exciting opportunity.","Of course, the turn is not fully complete. We're all learning more and more every day, but we are confident the pace of change we have set gives us an important long-term advantage over our competition.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Wade.","Wade Davis","Thanks Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results.","At our media networks segment revenues in the quarter were up 5% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up 3% while international revenues increased 11%. Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency international revenues were up 21%, primarily due to the acquisition of Channel 5.","Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our media networks' revenue performance. In terms of advertising, worldwide advertising revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 7% and international revenues grew 45%. The increase in international advertising revenues was driven by growth in Europe principally from Channel 5.","Foreign exchange losses had a nine percentage point negative impact on international advertising growth. In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 10%. Domestic revenues were up 15% in the quarter while international revenues declined 14%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was due to the timing of product available under certain distribution agreement as well as rate increases.","Foreign exchange had a 12 percentage point unfavorable impact on international affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenue declined as revenue growth from new channel launches and increases in subscribers were more than offset by the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.","Turning to expenses, overall expenses increased 12% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 19% while distribution and other expenses increased 11%. SG&A expense increased 3% in the quarter. Expense growth was driven by the acquisition of Channel 5 as well as higher programming, advertising and promotion expense, primarily related to new original series and specials.","Media networks\u2019 adjusted operating income was down 6% for the quarter and the adjusted operating income margins was 37%. Moving to filmed entertainment, revenues were down 24% in the quarter principally due to decreases in home entertainment and theatrical revenues. Foreign exchange had a five percentage point unfavorable impact on filmed entertainment revenue growth.","Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of filmed entertainment revenue. Theatrical revenues declined 20%, foreign currency had a nine percentage point unfavorable impact on theatrical revenues. Lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by revenues from our current quarter releases, including Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation and Terminator Genisys.","Home entertainment revenues declined 54% principally due to the absence of releases in the September quarter of this year whereas last year we released Transformers and Noah. Ancillary revenues declined by 38% due primarily to lower consumer product licensing revenues with last year's September quarter benefiting from the release of Transformers. Filmed entertainment generated adjusted operating income of a $122 million in the quarter as compared to 213 million last year. The September quarter of last year benefited from both the theatrical and home entertainment of performance of Transformers.","Moving to taxes the full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.2%, reflecting a 20 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Dooley","Thank you, Wade. Let me cover our full year result as well talk about our cash flow and our debt. I\u2019ll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 fiscal year that haven\u2019t already been discussed. For the full-year, Viacom generated $13.3 billion of revenue. $3.9 billion of adjusted operating income, $2.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $5.44 of adjusted earnings per share. That breaks down as follows.","Media Networks generated revenue of $10.5 billion which is an increase of 3% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion declined 3% as compared to 2014. Affiliate revenue grew 5% for the year, while advertising revenue increased 1%. And the Media Networks adjusted operating income margin was 39.5%. Filmed Entertainment generated revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted operating income of a $111 million and an operating income margin of 4%. For the total company foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 2% on revenue growth, 1% on operating income growth and $0.14 on full-year EPS.","As I mentioned, we generated 2.2 billion in operating cash flow for the year or $5.50 per share, which is a free cash flow yield of approximately 11%. In terms of capital return to shareholders, for the full-year, we repurchased 21 million Viacom B shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion. In July, we also increased our dividend per share by 21% to $0.40 a share. Between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $2.1 billion to our shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market capitalization of approximately 10%. We ended the year with 50 million Viacom A shares and 348 million Viacom B shares outstanding.","Now, moving onto our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. In September, we repaid a $250 million of outstanding of our 4.25% senior notes which came due. We also redeemed $550 million of our 6.25% senior notes, which are due in April 2016, leaving 368 million remaining outstanding. We ended the quarter with $12.3 billion of total debt and $506 million of cash and cash equivalents. This is an $800 million decrease in gross debt from our June quarter. As previously mentioned, we redeemed the $550 million of senior notes to ensure that we stayed within our leverage ratio target. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was three times.","Now let's turn to some other factors impacting fiscal 2016. We've discussed ad sales and affiliate revenues. For the full-year we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid to high single-digits. In terms of taxes, for 2016 we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. At Paramount, we're excited about our upcoming slate, which includes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profit to be weighted to the back half of the year as the studio benefits from their summer releases. For the December quarter, given the softer performance of certain of our theatrical releases we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year.","Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, Paramount has just wrapped production on Star Trek 3 and they are currently in production on next Jack Reacher film. Current films in preproduction includes Brad Pitt starring in a romantic thriller, second World War 2, Robert Zemeckis and a film by award winning filmmaker Alexander Payne titled Downsizing. In addition, the studio is in active development on Transformers 5 as well as future installments of the franchise. And the studio extended their First Look production deal with Martin Scorsese.","In summary, we are investing in our brand and we're building new capabilities to take advantage of the opportunity and meet the challenges as our industry continues to evolve. At Media Networks we're growing the level of original program. Six of our top 10 networks are seeing year-over-year ratings growth and we continue to secure long-term affiliate deals with both traditional and digital distribution partners.","At Paramount, we are developing our franchise pipeline of film and we have made great progress in TV production in a short period of time. On the advertising front we are Don of the new age of data enhanced marketing. We have invested in technology and in our capabilities, which has enabled us to establish a leading position providing advanced ad sales products and solutions for our marketing partners. It is important to remember, television remains the most compelling vehicle for reaching and influencing consumers and data enhanced marketing will only make that more true.","With that. I would like to turn the call over to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] we\u2019ll take our first quarter from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you so much. One for Philippe, one for Tom. Philippe there has been a lot of discussion this second quarter on these calls regarding SVOD strategy and I was just hoping for sort of a more detailed update from your end. Especially as you are getting bigger into sort of more traditional Hollywood and dramas and comedies, but also strategy around your core channels. Is there anything of a data that you are seeing that suggests the strategy needs to be revised or changed and any thoughts on to the idea of holding back multiple seasons from current shows to pursue TV Everywhere versus selling into SVOD. And then for Tom, I was hoping just the first thoughts on free cash flow generation as you look at fiscal 2016. When I look at the last four to five years. Your conversion ratio has really bounced around a lot, I think there was some discussion in this call about ramping the films slate a little bit which can use some capital, any sort of thoughts around free cash flow progression versus 2015 would be helpful? Thank you.","Philippe Dauman","Thank you, Doug. I'll take your SVOD question. We have always been at the core side of thinking through how we handle distribution of our content, remember we have a vast library of owned content, for many, many years most of our networks have created original programming, while we have stepped up the level of original programming this is nothing new for us.","So we have successfully over the last several years generated a large amount of revenue from this new revenue stream; and we have strategically developed and chosen windows for different types of programming down to specific shows and moved around distribution of some of these shows around the existing major SVOD in the U.S. and diminishment of our presence on Netflix. And that goes both for our networks here at Viacom and Apex.","So we think that through we look at not just the monitory value, but the promotional value of having shows at different points in the cycle on SVOD and it is often useful to prior seasons as we launch new seasons as an example. Internationally, SVOD is a driver of growth, when you look at a country like China, which is somewhat limited and the traditional distribution of television product you are seeing a large number a larger number than in the U.S. of significant SVOD players.","So for the first we see China as a potentially significant growth market not just in the film business for Hollywood, but also for us in the television business and we are seeing rapid expansion of distributional opportunities there and elsewhere as well as increases in pricing as those service grow. So we view in this arena as in everywhere else that technology is our friend and it is good to be on the content side of the business and we maintain a flexibility on distribution.","I just want to touch on TV Everywhere, we also believe it is extremely important to work with our long-term distributors in expanding the television experience for consumers. It is good for the ecosystem and we are working very closely with them as the invest capital in developing technology for better TV Everywhere experience to provide the underlying content and to assist in better consumer interface; to assist in greater availability of video-on-demand and work with them on better monetization of the on-demand viewing where there is great opportunity for us and distributors in area such as dynamic and ad insertions to better monetization of all the content that consumers want to watch in the home and outside of the home.","Thomas Dooley","Doug on the cash flow question. As you can see from the cash flow schedule that we provided in the web deck, the media networks segment continues to generate in the area of $3.5 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow a year, we expect that to continue, we've made some capital investments in terms of incremental working capital, in terms of Paramount that's to fund the incremental production and expanded production I believe and I discussed in our remarks.","And in the future I think we can look forward to that tapering down as we get to the production level that we need to get to for those film. One of the big variables for us that you see in backup is cash taxes. Cash taxes benefited in 2015 from a very nice benefit associated with our acquisition of Channel 5 that has helped us in certain tax policies. Next year, we won't have the benefit of that Channel 5, so there could be an increase of $300 million plus associated on the tax line. But we're also looking at certain tax legislation that may offset some of that into the future. It\u2019s kind of hard to predict that tax line until that tax legislation gets nailed down, but you know we see the company being able to generate very strong free cash flow well into the future.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Nathanson with Moffett Nathanson.","Michael Nathanson","Thank you, I have to Philippe and Tom, either one of you guys can you just grab it. The first one and you mentioned this on your opening remarks. In 2016 Nielsen's going to make two big changes here in their measurement services. One is they are going to move to an NTX Audience Universe and second they are going to add total audience measurements. So I wonder, what do you think is going to happen to your GRP deliveries as they expand their measurements and [indiscernible] the lift you get from all that.","Thomas Dooley","Universe estimates will take us down a little bit and the other adjustment they are making will take us up a little bit. It's hard to forecast exactly how that's going to play out in the aggregate, but we think net-net we may benefit and this would begin in January and forward and it's only us that would benefit the entire cable ecosystem, so. We do look forward to that and think Nielsen is doing some good work there to try and make things more accurate and get a broader sample to help everybody get better definition on some of the smaller networks.","Philippe Dauman","I just want to reinforce what Tom just said, and that we are working very closely with Nielsen so that Nielsen measurement system continues to improve. So we are optimistic on that happening, the precise timing of when different levels of improvement occurs is obviously not within our control. And so that is a parallel joint effort to the efforts that we are making and better measurement through data analytics as I described in my remarks.","Michael Nathanson","Okay, and then secondly on Paramount, if you look at the results this year and the trend of past couple of years, it's been disappointing to our estimates. And I wonder, given the needs perhaps more scale or to make as you said, more production starts. Why not seek to consolidate Paramount with another studio, is scale an issue here and if not what is the diagnosis for the ills over the past couple of years.","Philippe Dauman","Well look the movie business is a cyclical business. We certainly have seen that in a big way with what Universal has done this year where they have moved from what was a couple of years ago lower operating income performance than what Paramount had last year to well over billion dollars in operating income. That's just the nature of the business. Now for a variety of reasons having to do with issues in development to cash availability and so forth, we just had too few movies to support the infrastructure that we have and really to generate revenue.","So we think Paramount will turnaround that's why we're investing in it. We are operating Paramount efficiently, we have growth initiatives in television and animation that will pay off as you know Michael it does take a little time. Had we for example started the television production business a few years ago, there would be significant deficits in this kind of business. We're able in today's environment to start up very successfully this television production business with almost no net cost to us in either overhead or development with a variety of shows that we have.","So we're very optimistic about where Paramount can go. We do have a large number of franchises as we do have long-term relationships with some of the top talent around ranging from recent renewal of Martin Scorsese to Michael Bay to J.J. Abrams coming off the coming release of Star Wars. So just a broad variety of talent and we believe Paramount will come back and come back strongly in the years to come.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks Philippe, thanks Tom.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Thank you. Philippe you talked about fully measured consumption earlier, the market is getting more comfortable with Vantage, so can you talk about what contribution you are seeing to growth and to what extent there may be an opportunity to monetize Vantage outside of Viacom and also are you still on target for your non-Nielsen advertising target of 30 going to 50. Thanks.","Philippe Dauman","Yes, we are driving to growth of Vantage, obviously there're big opportunities as you have upfront discussions leading up to next year as part of the upfront sales which is why we're targeting this tripling of Vantage clients. And remember let me put the number of Vantage clients in context. If you look at our advertising revenues, our top 100 or so advertising clients accounts for more than three quarters or our advertising revenues, these are the major marketers in the U.S.","So, when we talk about having 11 today and tripling them and obviously there is a focus of the biggest season among the 100, it really does turn into a significant portion of our advertising base and that's what gets us over this three year period to having all of these measure and metric compliment the Neilson part of our business and we intend to grow that rooster of clients from next year into the following year.","Because we have this leading capability, it is true that there are lot of other players, new emerging players as well as existing ones who are interested in talking to us about opportunities to work together and driving outside revenue. So you are quite right to identify the possibility of some enhancements as we work with others and engage in these partnerships. You will be seeing more announcements in months to come of partnerships likely the one we recently announced with TiVo and others.","John Janedis","Thanks, Philippe. And maybe separately, just another theme this quarter has been reducing ad loads, you talked about that a few months ago, now that we are kind of there, meaning calendar fourth quarter. on the practical level, will there be any visible impact on that growth?","Philippe Dauman","Well I think as I mentioned and we expect to see continued sequential improvement and this is despite this reduction of ad loads, we think it's a good strategic decision. We are playing for the full year and we are playing for the longer, we have all these other products that I have mentioned that we just talked about is one example that will enhance our monetization as we go forward.","Not to mention, a continued growth in compelling programming, we continue to have a large number and a big proportion of the top hits on cable television and that will continue to grow as we just accelerate the development production and airing of all these new shows in different genres on our different networks. So, I believe all of that together will continue to improve our advertising performance and also bring it back to a positive.","John Janedis","Great, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rich Greenfield with BTIG.","Matthew Esposito","Hi, this is Matt on for Rich, just a quick one for Philippe. So selling to Hulu has been perceived as better or been selling Netflix, because at least it protected the ad model. So I guess I just was curious to hear your thoughts on Hulu\u2019s ad free subscription and I guess Viacom\u2019s willingness to sell the other ad free SVOD service is going forward.","Philippe Dauman","Thank you Matt. Well as I said before, we are both strategic and tactical in how we license content to all forms of distribution and we want the entirety of the ecosystem to work well together. We think there is just a lot of opportunity, consumers are using multiple services, in the course of their lives they watch television on a big screen, they will use their tablets or watch on apps, their new mobile products like Go90 out there.","We think there are lot of opportunities for content owners, both for existing content that we produce for television and new forms of content, what I did not mention except touching on it in the opening remarks is we have an opportunity to create a lot of new short form and even longer form content specifically for new platforms. We've announced developments for platforms like Snapchat of series that are 10 seconds each, we are going to have a leading mobile video production capability both in LA and New York and as well internationally.","So we are willing to look at all models, of course, it depends on what value we receive in exchange for that. So the model of having both advertising and affiliate revenue is a great model, but ad free model can also be good depending on what monetization you get and we're good monetization when we do SVOD deals and that whole environment we look at it as a totality, it's been a growth market for us. Even though content moves from platform-to-platform it's been overall a steady growth market and I believe you will see new players emerge both here in the U.S. and abroad and that will create even more opportunities for us and our competitors.","Matthew Esposito","Thank you.","Philippe Dauman","You are welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you just two questions. I guess first following up on your commentary on advertising revenues and the outlook. I mean any color you can give us in your ability to monetize both a healthier scatter market that we are seeing right now and obviously better ratings at Nick in the December quarter when take into account the reduction in ad loads that you have mentioned perhaps prior makers and the commitment you have made in the upfront. I guess are you still in a good position to monetize it?","Philippe Dauman","Yes the scatter market as many of our brethren have pointed out is strong were seeing good pricing, good demand and we will every attempt particularly on networks that and they are more of our networks that are growing their ratings. we will look at opportunities to take advantage of that and off course to your point working our ways through our ADU obligation, and we expect to see continued momentum not just the Nick, but across a number upon that was that Tom mentioned and I had named. So the networks six of our top 10 networks are showing growth and we are working on the other four to turn to growth with very specific measures including I think good changes in leadership that have occurred over the last several weeks and months.","Alexia Quadrani","And then jus the follow-up on your commentary on content sales, I think you just said it's a good growth opportunity, good growth market. Is there any way you can sort of frame it for us in terms of even just very generally speaking in terms of kind of what inning are you in, I mean how much you have that some great deals that you have done so far. I guess any sense of how much opportunities still exist due these deals both domestically or internationally?","Philippe Dauman","Well. We are in a constant dialogue and as we are ramping up production obviously there is a lot of interest in what we are doing among those distributors as well as others. Also as I touched on earlier it's an opportunity for Paramount to produce original programming, some of those who are generating original programming and a lot of its production also creates opportunity internationally. Internationally we really are seeing significant growth in new distribution platforms that just SVOD but just generally mobile for example that\u2019s creating opportunities for us over the medium and long-term that just didn\u2019t exist before and we are working hard to develop that.","The other benefit of the increased level original programming, we are creating here in the U.S. is that it is supporting our launch of many media networks internationally. Very often those networks have been distributed in a TV Everywhere fashion with a lot of multiplatform capabilities. There are actually a number of countries in the world, which in many respects are more advanced than the U.S. in that regard.","So we are particularly optimistic on the opportunities around the world and we have strong hold positions in the UK and in India, which are both great markets and a lot of open deals of opportunities in Latin America, in Africa and other parts of Asia as well as Europe. For example, this month we have launches going on in France, we have we My MTV, which is a first time for this product if you can remember My Nick Jr. so we have My MTV starting for the first time in France and you can expect to see that in other markets and we are also launching BET France this month. So we continue to launch new products and are in discussions with a number of players and a lot of new players coming through our doors talking about the opportunity to take advantage of our brands and our content.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","Philippe Dauman","You are welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.","Brian Wieser","Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just talk about monetization of your apps and digital revenue and associated with those apps and maybe more broadly? How do you look at monetizing a non-video activity at the present time?","Philippe Dauman","Well. There are several ways in which we monetized our apps; there in a TV Everywhere environment when we have expansion of the TV Everywhere universe with our affiliates there would be more and more opportunities to monetize that content. We have additional content that is in front of the wall, including as you suggest other types of content whether its games or otherwise that we derive revenue from and that also grow.","And then finally there is the game apps and apps like Noggin which we monetized through subscription revenue or sale revenue. So that is a growing universe and again that's not just in a U.S. context but in an international context and for example, the Play Plex product that our international group is launching will open up multiplatform revenue in different parts of the world and we are working with affiliates around the world to roll that out. And we've been told by a lot of affiliates that is the most advanced product in the marketplace and they are very pleased with it.","Thomas Dooley","Brian on the digital and the digital world as you know the inherent linear television model that we live with today if an advertiser buys female 18 to 34, 18 to 49, any other delivery around that part or that advertisement is now monetized. If you move to the VOD world where cable system operator has video-on-demand and the show is watched. You have the opportunity to really dynamically insert ads to each viewer which results in a much increased yield in terms of the amount of revenue and monetization of each viewer watching the show. So as that evolves and that's a long-term evolution that will take place over the next three to five years. That will provide I think many advertisers and certainly media companies selling advertising with an opportunity to get a much more efficient yield and monetization associated with the consumption and viewership around each television show.","Brian Wieser","If I may just on that when it comes to traditional television, what are you currently seeing in terms of the opportunity for programmatic TV sales and maybe monetizing some of the inventory that advertisers aren't chasing because of conventionally data driven, the data driven sales. You are trying to push or the conventional age, gender based demos, do you see\u2026","Philippe Dauman","Programmatic has its role Brian, but you know for us, a lot of our advertisers - we use that for remnant inventory that we can\u2019t sell and to be quite blunt about it we don't have a lot of inventory that can\u2019t sell. We sell the vast majority of our inventories. I think programmatic down the road combined with VOD will certainly drive up the yield, net revenue per show as we get paid for more of the viewership on each show.","Brian Wieser","Great, thank you very much.","Wade Davis","Operator we have time for one more question.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Kraft","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask you two questions. Following up on the topic of ad load reductions, can you explain how you are going about implementing those ad load reductions across the networks for example is that happening all at once. And is reducing the clutter giving you some visible improvement in the pricing you are getting. And then separately on your affiliate fee outlook, how dependent is the high single-digit 2016 growth outlook on step-ups from upcoming renewals and can you just comment on what the underlying assumptions are for licensing revenue growth in 2016, are you expecting growth there, you know a more of a flat outlook. So any help there would be great. Thank you.","Philippe Dauman","As far as the ad load we've been focusing mostly on networks primetime, we've been looking at it network-by-network and very often on shows, we expect over time as viewing experience improves that that will improve ratings and we do believe there are some pricing opportunities particularly when you marry it with our Viacom Velocity and Vantage product. As far as affiliates, we have a large number of opportunities, we have long-term contracts that are in place multiple years, we have these new outlets whether it's SVOD, mobile or otherwise. So as we have over the last many years we continue to be comfortable with guidance now in the high single-digits, we had double-digits, we always guide at the high single-digit and low double-digit. We continue to guide it in the high single-digit, as a reminder we did 8% domestic affiliate growth last year.","Bryan Kraft","Okay.

Consistent investment and content keeps our brands creatively vibrant and culturally relevant. This fiscal year, our Media Networks are launching and developing more original programming than ever across multiple formats, from reality to scripted, live action to animation. Our programming pipeline has never been more diverse or more tailored to the taste of our audiences. Our affiliate revenue is strong and growing, thanks to brands that remain must carry content for existing and emerging distributors alike.","We are seeing encouraging signs of a strengthening ad market as we enter the upfront season. Overseas, we continue to make great progress in pursuit of our ambitious targets for expansion and operating income growth, particularly as we increase our offerings for adult audiences with Comedy Central and with the new Paramount Channels, while continuing to expand the Nickelodeon brand. Paramount Pictures is cementing its reputation as one of the best run studios in Hollywood, capturing efficiencies even as it unlocks value from innovative and highly profitable releases, including the double insight of the second quarter.","Finally, by monetizing our content and our brands and tightly managing costs, we continue to maintain one of the best balance sheets in the business. Our consistent ability to generate substantial free cash flow reinforces our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.","This morning, I will give an overview of our financial results for the second quarter and review highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide additional detail, and then we'll open it up to questions.","First, the numbers. Viacom's consolidated revenues grew 2% to $3.33 billion in the second quarter, driven by growth in our Media Networks segment. Operating income increased 23% to $932 million. Our Media Networks delivered 5% growth in revenues and an 11% increase in adjusted operating income on strong increases in affiliate revenues. ","Filmed Entertainment revenue decreased 5%, reflecting lower theatrical revenue due to a less widely distributed mix of releases in the same period last year, which featured significant hits, Rango, No Strings Attached and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. Adjusted operating income in Filmed Entertainment increased 195%, driven by lower distribution costs, which more than offset lower revenue. Our adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased 24% to $535 million in the March quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.98, up 36% over the second quarter of fiscal 2011.","During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased $700 million in stock under our share repurchase program. We expect to buy back $700 million in stock again this quarter and are on track to purchase $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year.","Our Media Networks remains strong and creatively vibrant, with our nearly $3 billion fiscal year investment in content, yielding a greater output of new, original, wholly-owned content than at any time in Viacom's history. In this age of time-shifting and on-demand viewing across platforms, the value of fresh and compelling original content is greater than ever.","All of our networks are tapping rich development pipelines set by strong brand filters and deep consumer insights. As we pop out more content, we continue to innovate how we market, distribute and build experiences around programming across platforms. Our brands are well out in front in experimentation and advances in social networking applied to television content. ","In ad sales, we began to see signs of recovery in marketplace. We were able to capitalize on this improvement and return to growth domestically. For the quarter, our domestic advertising revenues increased 1%. Worldwide advertising revenues were flat at $1.07 billion for the quarter. We remain encouraged by what we're seeing and we expect to capture new opportunities in the market as we head into the upfront season.","I want to point out that for our fiscal third quarter, there are 2 event timing issues that will reduce year-on-year domestic ad sales quarterly comps by a total of about 3 to 4 percentage points. This year, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards took place in the second quarter and the BET Awards will air early in the fiscal fourth quarter, both aired in the third quarter last year.","Distribution continue to be a strong and steady driver of revenue for Viacom. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased 17%, driven by higher revenues from digital distribution agreements, as well as rate increases. During the quarter, we successfully closed a number of digital distribution deals, including an agreement to provide library content to Amazon for its Prime Instant Video service. We also increased distribution with our existing affiliates, with a particular focus on gaining distribution for our HD simulcast. In particular, we made significant gains in carriage of TV Land HD. For our 2012 fiscal year, we expect to grow affiliate revenue by 10%. ","Our Media Networks remain first choice partners for distributors as they test in market new products and technologies. We continue to build on our strong VOD offering by striking agreements to provide additional library content, as well as current episodes from some of our most popular brands and franchises. We remain committed to supporting our distribution partners multi-platform efforts, with authenticated sites offering on-demand content for MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, VH1 and SPIKE. A BET-authenticated site will launch soon.","We're also exploring opportunities to connect with consumers through tablet devices. A recent study by our strategic insights and research group uncovered that tablets have surpassed laptops as the second screen of choice among consumers. Currently, we partner with Cablevision to make linear feeds of our networks available through its in-home streaming tablet app. As we strengthen our existing partnerships, we are aggressively pursuing new distributors for both our long- and short-form content.","Internationally, we're moving ahead decisively in our drive to expand our reach in revenue around the globe. Viacom international media networks turned in another strong performance, powered by affiliate revenue growth in both organic and visual distribution and excellent cost management. We set ambitious goals for our international operations. As I've said on prior occasions, we're aiming for margins exceeding 20% in the next fiscal year and OI growth at a 30% compounded rate over the next 5 years. I'm pleased to report that we're very much on track to achieve these goals and we expect to exceed that OI growth rate this year.","Our growing adult-focused business will be a key driver of this growth. We made great progress in the second quarter. Ratings of our international Comedy Central channels were up 35%. In the last 6 months, we've launched 5 new comedy channels, most recently in Russia, which now puts the network in 5 continents and more than 40 countries.","We debuted our first-ever Paramount Channel in Spain at the end of the second quarter, opening a new chapter in our international expansion strategy. Based on audience share during its first month, the Paramount Channel is the most successful digital terrestrial television channel launched in Spain in the past 12 months and the country's second most successful DTT launch of all time. The channel premiere on March 30 with titles including The Godfather trilogy, Breakfast at Tiffany's and American Beauty. We're on target to sign 80 advertisers for the free-to-air channel in each of its first 2 months of operation. With one successful launch under our belt, we're looking to move quickly on future launches in additional markets.","Even as we expand to new markets, we're strengthening our presence in existing ones. We had a very strong quarter in the U.K., one of our most important markets. Ratings were up 21% at MTV U.K., thanks to Jersey Shore, which just concluded its second season as the highest-rated series ever for the channel. Comedy Central ratings are up 67%, thanks to strong U.S.-based acquired programming and our local original comedy, Threesome. Finally, Nickelodeon U.K., as well as the Nick brand in many markets around the world, saw ratings gains, driven by iCarly and Victorious, with a strong pipeline in the current quarter as well.","Turning now to ratings highlights from our domestic Media Networks. MTV remains strong with its millennial audience. The network was #1 with its core 12-34 demo in its key 10-spot prime time slots, where it beat its closest competitor by nearly 50%. For the quarter, MTV had 3 of the top 10 cable series in its core demo, including the returning champ, Jersey Shore, along with Teen Mom 2 and Challenge: Battle Of The Exes. We expect MTV's ratings for the current quarter to grow year-on-year.","MTV also continued to prove its expertise in moving content across platforms, reaching its audiences in innovative new ways through digital events, franchises, social media and mobile. MTV achieved a rare milestone in the second quarter when it surpassed 100 million likes, that's 100 million likes on Facebook according to social media tracking firm, Trendrr. Add to that, it's nearly 6 million Twitter followers and it's top ranking on Foursquare, Tumblr and Instagram, and MTV is the #1 most social TV brand.","Comedy Central continues to connect with its core male audience with a diversified slate of originals, specials, stand-up comedy and the unstoppable late-night tandem of Stewart and Colbert. ","Tosh.0 recently concluded its winter season as the #1 show on Tuesday nights on all of television with the networks key men 18-34 demo. ","The network launched another original hit in the second quarter with sketch series Key & Peele which won its timeslot with men 18-34 in its debut season. Key & Peele will return for a second season in the fall, boasting with many, including the President himself in a recent interview believe to be the best President Obama impersonation on television.","In late night, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report achieved the distinction of being the only late-night talk shows to notch year-over-year growth with adults 18-49. The Daily Show is the #1 late-night talk show in the demo, beating all broadcast and cable competition.","Nickelodeon retained its top spot in the second quarter as the #1 cable network in total day. SpongeBob was the #1 animated program on all of television with kids 2-11, while iCarly was the #1 kid's program among total viewers. The second quarter also saw the return of the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards which, in its 25th year, reached 15 million total viewers and generated a record 223 million votes online, hosted by Will Smith and featuring performances by Katy Perry and One Direction, the KCA's made the leap into a truly global juggernaut this year, earning its highest ratings ever by a wide margin in key markets, including the U.K., Germany and Australia.","The upcoming launch of the reinvented Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise in the fall is just one element of Nickelodeon's largest slate of original content ever. More than 650 episodes of returning hits and new series overall in 2012, 2013 season. ","In the second quarter, Nick introduced How to Rock, starring Cymphonique Miller, which debuted as the #1 new show of 2012 with tweens 9-14. FRED: THE SHOW, which successfully expanded the Fred Figglehorn franchise as the #1 new live-action show with kids 2-11, and Big Time Movie starring Big Time Rush, which attracted 26 million total viewers over its telecast.","In the current quarter, Nickelodeon debuted animated series The Legend of Korra to 4.5 million total viewers successfully channeling the cult following of Avatar: the Last Airbender to create a breakout hit.","Korra is Nickelodeon's most-watched animated series premiere in 3 years. Also coming this quarter are new episodes of iCarly, Victorious, SpongeBob and the new original TV movie Rags starring Keke Palmer, and we will continue to pilot on. Nickelodeon is poised to become bigger and better than ever and continues to be an important locomotive of our international and consumer products expansion.","BET continued its reign as the #1 ad-supported cable network for African-Americans 18-49. In the second quarter, the network showed further proof of its prowess in launching buzz-worthy tentpole. The 2012 BET Honors were the #1 BET Honors broadcast of all-time, up 69% over last year's show, with 2.5 million total viewers. The show is a big social driver, with more than 20 separate artists-related topics trending on Twitter during the broadcast. The network's original sitcoms also continued to perform well. For the calendar year-to-date, THE GAME and Let's Stay Together are the top 2 sitcoms on ad-supported cable among African-American and total viewers.","Throughout our history, our networks, all of our networks have demonstrated an uncanny capacity for reinvention. Across our brands, we've enhanced our ability to develop creative content through a systematic approach, conduct relentless consumer research and refined brand filters based on the evolving tastes and needs of the audience.","VH1, SPIKE and CMT, 3 networks we've earmarked for evolution in recent years, continue to build strong momentum behind this approach. VH1 is shining again. The second quarter was VH1's highest-rated quarter in 2 years, with ratings up 37% in prime. The network's third consecutive quarter ratings growth was highlighted by its performance in Monday prime time, where it was tops in all cable among women 18-49. The original T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle attracted on average 2.4 million total viewers an episode, the highest-rated debut season on VH1 in nearly 3 years, while Love & Hip Hop 2 scores the network's highest-rated series in more than 3.5 years.","VH1 also affirmed its status as pop-culture bellwether, with of the moment specials including Whitney Houston: Death Of A Diva and Greatest Women In Music, as well as new episodes of behind the music, which scored strong ratings.","VH1 should continue to roll this quarter with the premieres of new series, including Mob Wives: Chicago and Couples Rehab and the return of scripted-hit series, Single Ladies. ","SPIKE is making great progress as it broadens its appeal with men through more original programming. In it's first quarter with a new USC programming, the network retained its connection with the MMA community through the launch of MMA Uncensored Live, TV's highest-rated MMA news program. SPIKE also committed to a multi-year extension of its strategic partnership with TNA Entertainment's IMPACT Wrestling.","SPIKE's line-up of original programming gained ground in the second quarter. Breakout hit INK MASTER continued to perform well and new series of American Digger, starting Ric Savage, premiere to 1.2 million viewers, making it SPIKE's most-watched half-hour reality premiere in more than 3 years.","CMT delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, featuring the 2 highest-rated series debuts in networks history, by Big Redneck Vacation and Bayou Billionaires. The network earns its best ratings in prime time since the fourth quarter of 2009, its highest-rated original film in 3 years with Whiskey Business and the highest-rated Crossroads episode in 7 years, featuring Steven Tyler and Carrie Underwood.","TV Land continues to build the best lineup of original sitcoms on cable. With the show in it's third season, Hot in Cleveland's Betty White won her second consecutive SAG Award for Outstanding Performance in a Comedy Series. The Soul Man, a Hot in Cleveland spinoff, starring Cedric \"The Entertainer\" and Niecy Nash, will debut in June, along the with The Exes, starring Kristen Johnson, Donald Faison and Wayne Knight.","Meanwhile, Logo posted its highest-rated quarter ever, thanks to the ongoing success of RuPaul's Drag Race now in its fourth season. ","Let's turn now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount entered its milestone 100th year of operation to resounding critical recognition in Hollywood. Paramount sales were nominated for 18 Academy Awards, winning 6, good for second best among all studios. Martin Scorsese's Hugo won 5 Oscars, tied for the highest number of wins for a single film, while Gore Verbinski's Rango took home the award for Best Animated Film.","In terms of theatrical releases, Paramount again showed its ability to launch highly profitable original franchises with The Devil Inside from the studio's Insurge label. The film far exceeded box-office expectations, earning more than $100 million worldwide to date. In the current quarter, Paramount rerelease James Cameron's TITANIC in stunning 3D. The 3D film has achieved more than $300 million worldwide box office to date and continues to attract new and long-time fans alike. This month, Sacha Baron Cohen's The Dictator invades theaters, followed June by G.I. Joe: Retaliation, starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Channing Tatum and Bruce Willis. ","Paramount also announced this quarter that it will release KATY PERRY: PART OF ME, which will bring Katy to the big screen for the first time ever in 3D on July 5. In Insurge and MTV film, PART OF ME is a great example of the type of low-cost, quick-to-market films that combined with Paramount's franchise-centric film to create the studio strategically balanced and focused release slate.","Beyond the big screen, Paramount continues to add value across Viacom, not only in its partnership of our international division and Nickelodeon, but also through EPIX which continues to increase in value.","To close, the second quarter of our 2012 fiscal year was another strong one for Viacom. We, again, demonstrated our consistent ability to deliver great financial results and strong returns for our shareholders. We will continue to invest in content to develop the most compelling programming, networks and films for our audiences. As we do, we'll manage  our operations for maximum effectiveness and efficiency. This year and over the next several years, our strategy is to drive continued top line and bottom line growth, with particular acceleration in the international arena. And over the next several years, we will continue to implement our commitment to return significant capital to our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy.","James W. Barge","Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and Web presentation, summarizing the results of our March quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. ","This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's March quarter exclude a loss associated with the redemption of our 6.85% senior notes due 2055, which was $21 million on a pretax basis and $13 million after tax, as well as $66 million of discrete tax benefit. Last year's March quarter excluded the charge associated with the tender proportion of our 6.25% senior notes due 2016, which was $87 million on a pretax basis and $54 million after tax. ","Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues increased 5% to $2.2 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues were up 5%. Foreign exchange had a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 10 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.","As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 1% in the quarter. International advertising declined 9%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 4 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter.","In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 15%, while international revenues increased 24%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreement, as well as by rate increases. ","Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate and subscriber increases and new channel launches. Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 19% in the quarter, principally due to lower Home Entertainment revenue. ","Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $893 million in the quarter increased 11% over last year. The operating margin of 41% improved approximately 200 basis points over the prior year. The improvement in the margin was driven by top line growth of 5%, partially offset by a 2% increase in expenses. ","Within expenses, programming expenses grew 8%, while SG&A expense declined 5%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense and savings from our 2011 restructuring, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion expense.","Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 5% to $1.2 billion. Page 12 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. ","Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 19% to $326 million in the quarter. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to a less widely distributed mix of releases in the current quarter as compared to the releases in the March quarter of last year. This decline was partially offset by higher carryover revenues from the December quarter slate, which included Mission Impossible IV. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $415 million in the quarter. ","TV license fees were down 6% to $317 million. The decrease in TV license fees in the quarter was principally due to the availability in mix of title. Ancillary revenues increased 41% to $111 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher digital revenues.","Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $115 million in the quarter as compared to income of $39 million last year. The increase in operating income principally reflects lower print and advertising costs.","Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $5 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%. ","Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thanks, Jimmy. I'm going to focus my remarks on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year.","In terms of our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $869 million of operating free cash flow in the March quarter compared to $812 million last year. Page 5 of the Web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.","The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income, partially offset by an unfavorable working capital variance and higher cash tax payments. The unfavorable working capital variance in the quarter was impacted by increased participation payments primarily related to Mission Impossible IV and Transformers 3.","As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 5.1%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago, so we are making great progress on lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding these in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.","As we noted in our last call on January 9, we redeemed at par the $750 million outstanding of our 6.85% senior notes due in 2055. During the quarter, we also took advantage of the attractive rates in the public markets to maintain our leverage at our target level. We issued $500 million of 1.25% senior notes that are due in 2015 and $250 million of 4.5% senior notes due in 2042.","In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. At March 31, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 1.9x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of our quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 11x.","In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of $837 million of capital back to our shareholders in the March quarter.","Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the June quarter. So for the first 9 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders.","Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. Accordingly, in the June quarter, we expect affiliate revenue to be down slightly compared to the prior year. However, affiliate revenue will return to double-digit growth in the September quarter.","As Philippe mentioned, we have some timing factors in terms of advertising. The Kids' Choice Awards benefited the March quarter and the BET Awards will benefit the September quarter of this year, whereas last year, both of these events benefited our June quarter. These factors in combination with the lapping of strong digital revenues in the prior year will result in slightly lower Media Networks revenues in the June quarter. However, this should set us up nicely in terms of revenue growth for our September quarter. ","At this point in the year, we have a fair amount of clarity on our programming expense at Media Networks and expect it to grow mid-single digits for the full year. Given the pace of programming expense in the first half of the year, we anticipate that programming expense will grow in the high single-digit percentage range for the back half of the year.","Given our ongoing expense management, we expect to grow our margins at Media Networks for fiscal 2012. In terms of the back half of the year, given the timing of revenue that I just spoke about, margin expansion will occur in the September quarter.","For 2012, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%, and we expect that cash taxes will mirror book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, we are on track to repurchase $2.8 billion for fiscal 2012. ","Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline in May, we will release The Dictator, which stars Sacha Baron Cohen, and Paramount will also be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3 in early June and in July, they will release Katy  Perry movie, PART OF ME, in 3D. ","As a core part of its strategy, the studio continues to develop a number of new franchises, as well as sequels to existing franchises. On June 29, the studio releases the G.I. Joe 2 and in the fall, they'll release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. In December, Paramount releases One Shot, starring Tom Cruise, which is based on the best-selling novel and Jack Reacher book series. And in the summer of 2013, we are looking forward to the next installment of Star Trek, which is in 3D, and the release of World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt.","Looking further out, Paramount is developing a Nickelodeon branded live-action movie based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, which is scheduled to hit theaters in December of 2013 in conjunction with the significant consumer product initiative. In addition, the studio is working on a CGI-animated SpongeBob movie, and they recently announced the sequel to Anchorman, where they will reunite the original cast of Will Ferrell, Steve Carell and Paul Rudd.","Wrapping up, we remain focused on the levers that drive long-term value. From an operational standpoint, we are investing in organic growth initiatives, including expanding our international businesses, developing franchises with consumer products appeal and investing in our brands in order to strengthen their competitive position.","There are incremental opportunities to monetize our brands and franchises on a worldwide basis, as we continue to see demand for our content from new distributors on digital platforms. We remain disciplined in managing our operating expenses and driving the efficiencies throughout our businesses in order to enhance our margins, and drive earnings per share and free cash flow.","In addition, we are committed to an aggressive capital return program of share buyback and dividends, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders over the long term. ","I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have one for Tom and one for Philippe. Tom, just I guess the simple question would be your ratings have been down quite a bit but your ad revenues really hung in either. I was wondering if you could expand on the reasons why ratings performance has been so uncorrelated with domestic ad revenue. And then for Philippe, in your opening comments, you mentioned the growing value of EPIX. And I think that your online exclusivity of your EPIX deal with Netflix expires in September. It's been reported that you guys have been in talks with Apple on different possibilities. I'm just wondering if you could help us with how you think about the trade-off between exclusivity and non-exclusivity in online distribution for EPIX.","Thomas E. Dooley","Yes, Anthony, we're seeing a strengthening in the overall tone of the ad marketplace in terms of the volumes that are coming into the marketplace, and that has offset the impact of the ratings efficiencies that we've had, primarily on one of our larger channels, and that would be Nickelodeon. The ratings efficiencies on other channels have not had a significant impact on our ability to either attract or satisfy the demand that we have for the channels ad inventories. So it's working out very well and we continue to see that in this quarter. Philippe?","Philippe P. Dauman","Anthony, as it relates to EPIX, we're blessed that EPIX has an extremely strong movie lineup. We talked about the success of Paramount, Lionsgate, of course, has a great pipeline that now includes Hunger Games and MGM is preparing to release the next James Bond movie. So we have a particularly compelling lineup, which is drawing a lot of value to current EPIX distributors and a lot of interest for potential distributors. As it relates to Netflix, they're obviously a great partner and has been a great partner for EPIX. We will continue to be on Netflix under any circumstance. Not surprisingly, there are other companies interested in the content, but EPIX will announce what it's going to do as time progresses. But again, we have a very good and strong relationship with Netflix. Operator, we'll take our next question.","Operator","That will be from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","For Philippe and\/or Tom, can you just give us an update on how investors should think about how kids might be changing their viewing habits as content becomes increasingly available on VOD and online? And how do you balance the revenue you're receiving from licensing content online versus any cannibalization you might be seeing from traditional viewing? That'd be helpful.","Philippe P. Dauman","Okay, I'll take that, Doug. Well, there's been a lot of people putting out series on Nickelodeon ratings issues. There is no silver bullet. There has been a lot of focus lately by a particular analyst, which has reverberated elsewhere about the Nickelodeon having some library content on Netflix in particular. Just a few stats on that. And by the way, we are getting nice revenues through these SVOD deals. Netflix is present in less than 1\/4 of television households. And since we get the streaming data on our content, I can tell you that the time spent on Nickelodeon content on Netflix is approximately 2% of the time spent on our Nickelodeon channel. So even if you view that as being completely kind of ballistic, which is, of course, is not, it serves our customers in places where they might not otherwise be able to watch television, and it thus serve some promotional value. It would have a minimal impact here. So our approach is to address the issues that we have. As we have In the past, BET and MTV, for example, which subsequently reached all-time high in their history ratings, is to approach it with content, research, marketing and building up the brand, clearly, there's some ratings measurement issues we've just talked about in prior calls, but we're going to focus on ways in which we can affect the Nickelodeon brand positively. And as I mentioned in my remarks, Nickelodeon continues to expand, create value for our distribution and marketing partners alike in United States and around the world. So we feel very, very good about the direction of the pipeline, it's extremely strong. We're developing more new shows of our popular series and more exciting new series. And of course, we're particularly excited about the revival of the Turtles franchise. Operator, we'll go to our next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My comments just following up on your color on the advertising market. Could you please give us a bit more color on what you're seeing in scatter versus the upfront right now? And given your commentary about the ad market getting a bit stronger and your optimism that MTV ratings in the June quarter but also taking account the headwinds you also highlighted, is it possible to see positive advertising, domestic advertising growth in the quarter?","Philippe P. Dauman","Alexia, this is Philippe. Well, we feel very encouraged. We've seen the tone improved. We've gone through some very successful upfront presentations by our major networks and good meetings by other networks. Our partners are very excited by the programming lineup across the board and our commitment to investing in programming. The pricing remains good. The scatter pricing environment is good. There had been some volume issues, which we highlighted at our last ratings call and yes, we're encouraged by what we're seeing now as we head into the upfront. So we're not -- we do have just the timing issues of the event, which otherwise would have met 3 to 4 percentage points of positive impact in the quarter. But we're encouraged at this stage and we'll continue to drive our ad sales as we go forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, could you just talk from a housekeeping standpoint domestic ad revenues x the Kids' Choice Awards, and even more importantly, what were domestic ad revenues x Nickelodeon in total since that seems to be kind of the key group that people are focused on being a problem for you ratings-wise. And then two, Philippe, you mentioned this comment about 2% of time spent on Nick coming on Netflix, and I presume Amazon, if the Netflix number is that small, I assume Amazon's a tiny fraction even of that. How do you feel about the fees you're getting paid for that programming right now by Netflix and Amazon relative to the amount of time being spent on that programming?","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you, Richard. Well, as far as the Kids' Choice Awards helps the previous quarter, when we mentioned the cumulative impact of the Kids' Choice Awards moving out of this quarter and the BET Choice Awards moving out into the fourth quarter, the total is 3 to 4 percentage points. Think of it as being about evenly split between the 2 events, so you can do the math. We don't breakout ad sales among networks as to your second question. And as far as the percentage that I mentioned, it's obviously impactful for our distribution partners, but our Nickelodeon viewership is so strong that's why the percentage is low. And we're getting good value, we always root for all of our distribution partners to grow over time. And as they grow, we grow with them. And this is part of the reason that we can confidently plan on having affiliate revenue growth to continue at over a number of years at the high single-digits rate of growth, which, of course, we have been exceeding the last several years for the foreseeable future.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2, one for Philippe and one for Tom. Philippe, the ratings at Nick have fallen to levels that you've never seen before, down 30% or so. And if it's not Netflix based on what you're looking at, just give me 1 or 2 top reasons why you think it's down so much, because it's never been down this much before?","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, look, we've seen this -- as I said earlier, we've seen this level of ratings impact on some other major networks in the past, and we've overcome it. Yes, the Nick issue is complicated. There are ratings measurement issues, there's certainly has been some compelling programming that exists on some of our competitors which we can clearly address. We will do what we always do. We research our audiences, we review our development pipeline, add more diversity in our programming, more genres. Nickelodeon is really stepping up to the plate in a major way with the creative community, with its own programming teams. I'm very pleased more importantly, our marketing partners are very pleased with what they're seeing. And that was a very good reaction to the Nickelodeon upfront presentation. It's a very exciting lineup as we go forward. So this is what we do. This is what our teams do and we expect over time as we accumulates the program, as we market these new shows not only in our own platform but elsewhere, that we will gradually build on our ratings. And as I've said, we will not stop until Nickelodeon continues to get to bigger and better places. And clearly, all of our partners are very happy to be with Nickelodeon.","Operator","We'll go next to Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. First on film, can you -- I know you went through some of Paramount's schedule, but how confident are you that you can make up for the loss of DreamWorks Animation distribution next year? And can you talk a little bit about international growth, where are you seeing the most growth? What markets are the drivers penetration, or are there any markets where your ratings are particularly strong? If you can just give a some color on some of the markets, that would be great.","Philippe P. Dauman","Sure, Jessica. Well, we've had the opportunity at Paramount to plan our development slate, obviously, over the long term. We've known for a long time that our distribution agreement as it relates to new releases, ends after the 2 releases we're involved with this year, so we've got time to plan for it. And we've talked about all the great franchises. Obviously, we're going to have -- after next year, we're going to start our own animation releases. There'll probably be an additional on development, some distributed titles. We are given the success of our team at Paramount. There are several film makers who are -- would like to see Paramount in film distribution in their films for a fee. So we'll do just great. And Paramount has really managed through the strategically and tactically extremely well. As far as international growth, clearly, there's some weakness in a number of European markets economically, which has some impact on the ad revenue category, of course. But we're seeing nice growth as you can see in affiliate revenues, and that really is due to our ability to expand our brands in more and more countries to get ratings success. Comedy, Nickelodeon has been particularly successful; U.K., we've had great success across the board; and this Paramount Channel is going to add a lot of momentum. I expect that the Paramount channel will be distributed over the next 2 to 3 years across a very wide base of our distribution, across many, many countries. I've never seen as much receptivity to a brand as I've seen as I travel around the world for Paramount Channel. With the -- the movies resonate, they work well around the world, and that'll drive affiliate revenue and ad sales. So I think we have a very clear path ahead for the kind of margin improvement and operating income growth at very high levels that we've talked about.","Operator","We'll go next with John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Philippe, you mentioned that you've had the upfront presentations. Obviously, you've been in front advertisers on Nick as well. How is the ratings issue impacted those conversations and to what extent would it impact your CPM growth relative to peer networks?","Philippe P. Dauman","Our partners have been very supportive. Of course, Nickelodeon is the place to be if you want to reach kids. There aren't too many advertising outlets to go after kids. One of our major competitors, of course, does not sell advertising. And we have the ability to -- particularly as we continue our multi-platform outreach, we have the ability to work with our partners in a way that's very, very unique to Nickelodeon, particularly as we have all these new live stars who are also taking advantage of some branding opportunities with some of our clients. So discussions have been good. We have -- the majority of conversations have been promising. And as I said, they like our commitment to programming, our commitment to building the brand and I believe we'll do quite well in the kids upfront.","Operator","We'll go next to Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I think one of the very positive things in the quarter was obviously the margin trends in cable networks, and a lot of that is predicated on your expense controls. But I'm wondering about the sustainability of that. I mean, you're ramping up tons of content on Nickelodeon but growing programming costs mid-single digits, SG&A downwards, some cost-cutting initiatives. As we look past this fiscal into the next fiscal, should we assume a step-up in expense trends or there's some more leverage you can pull to keep the kind of cost controls that we've been seeing like recently?","Philippe P. Dauman","Barton, we're committed to managing our business efficiently. We are also committed as we have been over the last several years, including through the recession, and increasing our investment program We do call it investment even though it appears on an accounting standpoint as an expense. And as we've said, we're going to do it consistently across our portfolio at mid-single digits rate, which is what we target. Now that means because we have so many networks, that we can grow it a little more for particular networks where needed and a little less in other networks where it's not needed. We're also changing the mix of our program. We've been coming off some expenses, third-party licensing deals and we are shifting those dollars, which were not very efficiently deployed, given the lower resonance of generally speaking of off-network programming. We've been able to deploy those dollars to relatively inexpensive original programming, which speaks more to our brands. So that -- those 2 factors combined will allow us to increase our investment programming, but do it in a way that doesn't damage our margins as we go forward. And as far as other expenses, we'll continue to keep a tight lid on them. And more importantly, we're going to focus on growing our revenues. And we have a lot of opportunities to do it. We have, of course, the affiliate revenue line that I talked about over the next several years; we expect to grow our consumer products revenue; our international revenues will grow; and our ad revenues as the market and ratings in certain areas continue to improve. So we feel that we'll be able to continue to maintain and improve our margins as we go forward.","Operator","We'll go next to John Tinker with Maxim.","John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the share buyback. I think, Tom, you mentioned you're paying 40 basis points now to draw down. Would you ever think accelerating that?","Thomas E. Dooley","At this point in time, I think we're sticking with the guidance that we've articulated for the Street. Philippe's articulated what we think we can purchase over the longer term focus, and I think we're on our way to accomplishing that and continue on that path.","Philippe P. Dauman","Operator we have time for one more question.","Operator","All right, that will be from Vasily Karasyov with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Tom, when you were talking about the trajectory of advertising revenue in the U.S. for the remainder of the year, I was wondering if that assumes continued year-on-year declines in Nickelodeon until the lap when the decline started. And then can I ask if you expect the audience delivery to stabilize after starting next fiscal year?","Thomas E. Dooley","Yes, we think Nickelodeon is putting in place actions that will help stabilize the audience delivery, and that will drive Nickelodeon's both ratings, audience, delivery and advertising back up to the place that it had been and its dominance in the marketplace. If you look at Nickelodeon's penetration both on the traditional television screen and across the many new platforms, which are unmeasured out there, Nickelodeon is in fact very strong in reaching lots and lots and lots of kids, and our programming is probably being consumed more today than it ever has been before. We need measurements to capture that and measurements once that occurs will be followed by significant monetization. So we're quite confident in the future that Nickelodeon has in terms of its relationship to the kids' marketplace and our ability to generates advertising there.","Philippe P. Dauman","We want to thank everybody for joining us for our March quarter earnings call.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation.

Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our March quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Cyma Zarghami, our President of the Nickelodeon Group.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.","I want to refer you to Page number 2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC.","Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on the call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Jim, and thanks to everyone, for joining us today. I'm happy to report Viacom delivered a solid fiscal second quarter, one in which we continued to show improvement, growing revenue in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. On the Media Networks side, increases in affiliate revenue, along with continued international strength, drove top line growth. On Filmed Entertainment, Paramount increased revenues across all of its business units. At the total Viacom level, revenues were up 8%, and we grew adjusted operating income 4% in the quarter.","Reported operating income was down 43%, driven by $280 million in restructuring and programming charges incurred as we realign and invest to fuel our new strategy. Wade will speak to all the numbers more a little later. But first, I'd like to take you through what I see as the headlines of the quarters beyond the financials. These come in four broad buckets: strategy, organization, our balance sheet and general execution, which is our increasing focus.","First, on strategy. On our last call, back in February, we laid out a comprehensive strategy for turning around Viacom. To put the full power of Viacom behind our flagship brand, to elevate our approach to content and talent, to focus on partnerships, to grow our brands beyond linear, both in digital and off-media; and to continue to strengthen our organization.","In the past few months, my team and I have spent considerable time sharing this new strategy with all of our key constituents, from our distribution, advertising and creative partners, to our employees and to you, our investors. And I'm happy to say that, throughout these conversations, the strategy was well received.","Second, organization. In the last quarter, we've made important progress on our enabling organization with the new senior leadership team now fully in place. The biggest news here is leadership at Paramount. As most of you know, we've hired Jim Gianopulos to run the studio. Jim is a smart, seasoned executive with the operating expertise to help the studio address its strategic challenges of the last several years and the strong creative relationships to help jump-start its pipeline.","Since early April, I've been working closely with Jim, and he is working closely with the senior team at Paramount to chart a new course for the studio. He is also working with leadership in our Media Networks to help map out long-term plans for co-branded films.","More broadly and across the company, we continue to take significant steps to ensure that our structure aligns with our strategy. We're breaking down the silos that have impeded broader collaboration across the company in the past.","For example, we recently announced Kern Schireson as Viacom's first Chief Data Officer and made moves to unify our research and audience science teams to further strengthen our data, media analytics and consumer insights across the company.","We also announced the creation of a new global product development group to more effectively develop and launch authenticated multiplatform products across our portfolio, principally to support the pay-TV viewing experience. That group will also ensure that we're bringing some of our international success stories, including our Play Plex mobile apps to the domestic marketplace.","Third, balance sheet. As I've said before, we remain committed to maintaining Viacom's investment-grade rating. To this end, we recently took significant steps toward strengthening our balance sheet, improving our leverage profile and enhancing liquidity. This included consummating a $1.3 billion hybrid debt deal, the proceeds of which were used to redeem $1.4 billion of our near-term maturities; and the April announcement of the sale of our 49.8% stake in EPIX to MGM for $634 million, which we anticipate to close shortly and whose proceeds will be used to retire further debt obligations.","And we moved forward with our slate financing agreement with our partners in China, which Wade will speak to later. Combined, these moves will strengthen our balance sheet, improve our liquidity and give us greater flexibility as we move forward.","Fourth, execution. Increasingly, this is what it's all about, executing. Let me share with you a few highlights from the quarter. First, MTV. Chris McCarthy and his team have been very busy behind the scenes. And I'm pleased to say that they're approaching the completion of their first phase of work, putting in place a new team, strengthening the schedules and introducing a new programming pipeline with renewed focus on unscripted content. This has already created some value.","What I'm most excited about is the second phase of work, bringing the team's hard work to the screens, to audiences. Starting this month and rolling out throughout the summer, this includes new content, new talent and return of daily live programming to the network. The first show to hit this month, a revamped and broadened MTV Movie and TV Awards airs Sunday, then a week later comes the new Promposal which is just what it sounds like, young people making pretty amazing proposals to take their intended dates to the prom. A new version of My Super Sweet 16 accompanies it. Then a reimagined Fear Factor, hosted by Ludacris, follows two weeks later and all of this is just the beginning.","There are eight new shows in the month. As part of this, we've also initiated a major expansion of our Times Square studio, best known as the TRL Studio, to power this drive into live. This will fuel a live afternoon programming block that will provide a critical on-ramp to MTV's primetime block. And by next fiscal year, the network expects to program nearly 50% more content powers. Additionally, it's pushing quickly into live experiences, including a free three-hour preshow festival for audiences to amplify the Movie and TV Awards this weekend.","Second, Paramount TV production, a real and untold success story. It launched in 2014 with the goal to create and deliver cinematic filmmaker-driven SVOD and premium cable content. Today, the studio has far exceeded its initial target of two dramas and one comedy on air in three years. They currently have the critically acclaimed series 13 Reasons Why now streaming on Netflix. It's already the most tweeted-about show of 2017.","They have renewals in the form of second seasons currently shooting on Berlin Station and Shooter and a third season of School of Rock with Nickelodeon and season three and four of the Bajillion Dollar Propertie$ on Seeso. And they are currently in production on the best-selling novel The Alienist for TNT and Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, starring John Krasinski, for Amazon.","This summer they begin shooting Maniac with Cary Fukunaga, Emma Stone and Jonah Hill and in the fall, The Haunting with Steven Spielberg's Amblin TV for Netflix. Paramount TV already has strong relationships with the top creators and producers on and off screen and has been recognized for its work with 10 nominations and 5 Emmy Awards with the breakthrough hit for Grease: Live.","Having a successful TV production business attached to the studio provides helpful consistency in cash flows, and I believe it is fundamental to the success of the studio. And let's not forget that this is a low capital-intensive business. We see considerable value here going forward.","Third, ad sales. Right now, we are several weeks into upfront conversations with our marketing partners. And I, along with our flagship brand leaders, sales and data executives have been meeting with agencies and clients to unveil new brand strategies and content and to discuss new ways of working together. Along the way, we've regularly heard from marketers about the need for consistency in audience targeting and measurement for advanced TV advertising. That's why we're so excited to unveil Open AP with our partners at Fox and Turner in March, creating the industry's first open platform for cross-publisher audience targeting and independent measurement, which builds on the success we've had with Vantage, our data-driven advanced audience platform.","We believe Open AP represents a considerable opportunity for programmers, agencies and advertisers and we're pleased to say that, from early positive feedback, they agree. While it's early days, I'm optimistic about this year's upfront and believe that both television and Viacom are well positioned. More on that next quarter.","Fourth, distribution. Here, we continue to move beyond one-note conversations on carriage to comprehensive discussions on how we can build more value for all parties while sustainably supporting and evolving the pay-TV ecosystem and we are not waiting until renewals to engage.","In fact, we are currently actively engaged with a number of parties all outside the traditional renewal discussions. Here, there are two things worth mentioning. First, we now have data and advertising pilots operational with two major U.S. MVPDs, whereby we are inserting some advanced advertising campaigns in their local commercial availabilities.","Second, we are speaking with several MVPDs regarding variations on the entertainment skinny pack concept, and we're optimistic that one could launch by the end of this year. Both of these are early but tangible examples of the implementation of the strategy we first rolled out to you on our last call. And whether it's marketers, distributors or other industry partners, a lot of this simply comes down to being more engaged, more accessible and more transparent. We've been and will continue to be very active on this front as we feel there's enormous potential to create new opportunities.","Fifth, international. I'm pleased to report that our business outside the U.S. continues to thrive. We are seeing continued strength in audience delivery across the pay portfolio with revenue-weighted share up 4% in the quarter. We also extended the reach of our pay brands in the Middle East with the launch of three new channels, including Paramount.","At the local level, our latest acquisition, Telefe, continued its dominance as Argentina's monthly ratings leader in every day part this quarter, contributing to our advertising and affiliate growth abroad. And Channel 5 experienced its fifth straight quarter of growth and increased its audience share in key demographics by 4% year-over-year.","Finally, last month, we announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in Porta dos Fundos in Brazil. We're really excited about this one. The company is a leading short-form comedy content producer creating digital native content for Brazil's number 2 YouTube channel. These are all important moves as we continue to position international as an even bigger contributor to our overall business.","Lastly, Nickelodeon. Under Cyma Zarghami's leadership, Nick has already built a strong foundation for what we're trying to achieve with all of our flagship brands. It's fully global, fully diversified across consumer products, experiences, theatrical and digital, while consistently dominant on linear.","With that, I'll hand it over to Cyma, President of the Nickelodeon Group, to share more insights into Nick's progress and priorities moving forward. Cyma?","Cyma Zarghami","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob said, Nickelodeon is on very solid ground. This success is the result of several strategic steps that propelled us to number 1 with kids, a position that we've held for three years and counting. And we continue to extend our lead over the competition with year-over-year ratings growth of 5% this quarter.","Nick has the top kid shows in every genre, thanks to a new generation of shows that kids love, with new hits like The Loud House and more new episodes from SpongeBob, live-action favorites like Henry Danger and a new set of popular preschool programs including PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines, providing diversification across our portfolio.","At any given time, we have a strong bench of six to eight shows that power the lion's share of our GRPs, which account for 65% of all ad-based kid viewing in the marketplace. It was the strength and diversity of our pipeline that earned the network's top-rated status and ownership of the top 10 shows with kids 2 to 11, kids 6 to 11 and kids 2 to 5.","So here's a little bit more about how we got here. First, based on findings from an in-depth research study that we conducted, we acknowledged and addressed three key developments in the landscape. A new generation of kids who are very different from those who came before them, even more new platforms and devices like smart TVs, streaming players and more tablets and an altogether different paradigm in entertainment, one that puts a premium on more new content and on-demand viewing.","So with that as a backdrop, we've rolled out the results of our audience research study to the entire organization. We installed new leadership in every creative group. We cultivated a new roster of Nick talent that reflects the audience. They're smart, relatable and diverse. We redesigned our New York facilities and expanded our West Coast offices in Burbank to ensure that our teams have the best environment to support their creativity. Burbank is the home to our animation production. We have 20 shows currently in production there and more than 600 incredibly talented in-house animators and creators.","We committed to building franchises from the ground up, which includes making consumer products a part of the development process. We reimagined a marketing approach for our content and brand that is multiplatform and immersive. It's 360 degrees, 365 days a year. And most importantly, we significantly increased our content pipeline. To meet the audiences' demand for more, we created a pipeline for every genre: live-action, animation, preschool, TV movies, live events and new formats like digital and short form.","For this current season, we have almost 700 episodes of new and returning series with a mix of programming coming from multiple initiatives that allow us to generate more content with only modest increases in production budgets, like co-productions with our international divisions and experiments with new formats. This content delivers results across platforms and geographies.","The Loud House is reaching SpongeBob-sized ratings in the U.S.A. And in less than a year, globally it's already top 10 in 10 countries. We continue to prioritize growing our owned and operated platforms. For the fiscal year-to-date, we saw 31% increase in full episode streams. Preschool was even stronger, where our episode streams grew 105%. And our preschool content, in particular, is helping power our strong consumer products portfolio. We have more than doubled the number of properties in our preschool portfolio, which helps us generate $4 billion in annual sales at retail.","PAW Patrol is the number 1 preschool property. It was the number 1 show for kids 2 to 5 this quarter. It was named licensing toy of the year by the Toy Association, and it remains both a hit on TV and in consumer products internationally. Shimmer and Shine is a top 5 preschool show here in the United States, and it's already a top 10 property in 10 countries. And we're also laying the groundwork for the launch next year of an all-new animated series for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The new series is a true reinvention and will energize the fan base across television, games and apps and consumer products.","Because our strategy is paying off, we feel confident in our performance, and we're now looking to make the Nick brand even bigger and beyond television. Very quickly, here's three initiatives that align with the overall Viacom strategy to move our brands more meaningfully into film, the physical world and the digital world. We're working closely with Paramount to develop IP for the silver screen and for small screen. There will definitely be another SpongeBob movie. We're developing big-screen treatments for Henry Danger and the Loud House, with more to come.","But the first example of this new collaborative way of working is Amusement Park, an animated film in theaters next summer first and then followed by a TV series. Amusement Park is a great example of the kind of movies that should be Nickelodeon. In the physical world, there's an opportunity with families to take vacations together. So we've launched a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic last year, and we have another one coming next year in Mexico. And our goal is to have a series of these license deals in the coming years.","Live tours are an important part of our franchise planning. The model right now is a PAW Patrol live tour, which has been selling out here and internationally. We're moving towards multiple tours up and running simultaneously.","Digital is another opportunity. Games are a successful extension of our franchises. We have more than 50 apps so far from seven different properties, and more than half of these have hit number 1 at launch. We recently announced the creation of our entertainment lab. It's a technology incubator for experimenting with VR, AR and AI in new, faster ways to develop and create and produce IP.","So as Nickelodeon keeps moving forward and growing, we'll continue to be laser-focused on cementing our position in the hearts and minds of the next generation of kids and families. We have a clear and growing leadership position in television and a clear path to significantly expand the brand with many, many initiatives already underway.","Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Wade.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Cyma, and good morning. We're pleased to report our financial results for the March quarter of fiscal 2017. In the quarter, we again saw revenue growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. We continue to execute on our strategic plan, and we took steps to strengthen our balance sheet and de-lever the company.","Before I take you through our adjusted operating results, I want to note that we took $280 million of restructuring and programming charges in the quarter. These actions are aligned with our new strategic plan, including our move away from scripted product on certain networks, the rebranding of Spike as the Paramount Network and the streamlining and consolidation of certain Media Networks support functions. While some of the savings from these actions will fall to the bottom line, the majority of the savings will be reinvested to fund the execution of our strategic plan.","Now let's take a look at our operating results. In terms of consolidated results, we saw growth across a number of key metrics in the quarter. Viacom generated revenue of $3.3 billion, an 8% increase over the prior year. And adjusted operating income of $612 million, which was up 4%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.79, an increase of 4% over the prior year. And year-to-date, we've generated $343 million of operating free cash flow, which is up 49% over last year. Our top line growth was driven by strong performance across all Filmed Entertainment revenue streams, increases in affiliate revenue and continued strength at our international Media Networks. Slide 4 of our web deck provides the financial overview of our Media Networks segment.","Revenues for the quarter increased by 1% to $2.4 billion. Revenues included a 1 percentage point unfavourable impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased 2%, while advertising revenues declined 1% and ancillary revenues were flat. Adjusted operating income declined to $747 million.","Slide 5 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' domestic and international revenue performance.","Domestic revenues decreased 2% to $1.9 billion, and we had another strong quarter at our international operations as revenues increased by 11% to $478 million. On an organic basis, if we exclude a 7 percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact and 10 percentage point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenue grew 8%.","At our domestic Media Networks business, we continue to see growth in affiliate with revenues up 1% in the quarter. The growth reflects rate increases, partially offset by a modest decline in pay-TV subscribers as well as the decline in revenues from SVOD agreements. Domestic advertising declined 4% in the quarter, consistent with our guidance from the last earnings call. The performance in the quarter reflects the timing of the Easter holiday, which had an unfavourable impact of 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, domestic ad sales performance was in line with the December quarter. Strong pricing increases were more than offset by lower impressions.","International advertising revenues increased 11% in the quarter. Organically, if we exclude an 11 percentage point unfavourable impact from foreign currency and a 17 percentage point positive impact from the acquisition of Telefe, international advertising revenues grew 5%, reflecting continued strength in Europe.","International affiliate revenues increased 10%, which included a 4 percentage point unfavourable impact from foreign currency and a 4 percentage point positive impact from the acquisition of Telefe. The growth in the quarter reflects the impact of rate increases, subscriber growth and new channel launches as well as higher revenues from SVOD and OTT agreements.","Internationally, ancillary revenues were up 11% due primarily to growth in consumer products, driven by the strength of our kids brands, including PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines as well as growth in TV licensing. Currency has had an immaterial impact on ancillary revenues.","Worldwide expenses increased 5% in the quarter and reflect an unfavourable 3 percentage point impact from the acquisition of Telefe and a favourable 1 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. Excluding these items, organic growth in worldwide expenses was 3%.","Within operating expenses, programming expense was flat due to the timing of programming premieres aired in the quarter. SG&A expense increased 11% in the quarter due to higher advertising and promotion cost and the acquisition of Telefe. Distribution and other expenses increased 9%, which included the impact of Telefe.","Overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making at Media Networks. We're moving quickly to implement our flagship brand strategy, and we expect to see the benefits of this strategy and a strengthened portfolio as we progress through the year.","Turning to Paramount. The slate financing agreement that we entered into last December remains on track and is in operation. Additionally, the partners have elected to upsize their commitment from 25% to 30%. As previously announced, this is a three-year agreement with an option to extend to a fourth and covers films beginning with our fiscal 2017 slate.","Now turning to the studio's results for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment revenues increased 37%, driven by gains across all revenue streams. Slide 6 of the earnings presentation provides the breakdown of the Filmed Entertainment revenues.","Theatrical revenues increased 10% to $238 million, primarily due to the release of xXx: Return of Xander Cage, partially offset by lower carryover revenues. Home entertainment revenues increased 29% to $198 million, primarily reflecting the number and mix of current quarter releases, including Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Arrival, Allied and Fences.","Licensing revenues increased 45% to $347 million, primarily driven by Paramount Television productions, including 13 Reasons Why and Shooter as well as higher revenues from pay-TV and SVOD distributors.","Ancillary revenues increased 149% to $112 million, primarily driven by the impact of the film slate financing in the quarter. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $66 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $136 million in the prior year, an improvement of $70 million. The improvement reflects the gains in revenue, partially offset by higher print and advertising expenses related to our fiscal 2017 theatrical releases.","In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 30.5% as compared to 32.8% in the prior year, driven by the mix of domestic and international income.","Slide 11 of the earnings presentation provides the components of free cash flow. Year-to-date, we generated $343 million of operating free cash flow, which is a 49% improvement versus last year. The increase in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower working capital utilization, reflecting lower film spend.","Looking at our debt on Slide 10. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end at 4.8%. We had $12.2 billion of total debt and $671 million of cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end. During the quarter, we continued to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our liquidity and de-lever the company. In February, we issued a total of $1.3 billion of hybrid securities, which received partial equity credit from the ratings agencies. In March, we used those proceeds to redeem $1.4 billion of our near-term maturities. If you take into consideration the equity credit we received on hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter-end was $11.5 billion.","In April, we announced the sale of our 49.8% stake in EPIX to MGM for $634 million, inclusive of dividends. We anticipate that the transaction will close this quarter, and we'll use the net after-tax proceeds of approximately $570 million to redeem outstanding debt. Pro forma to the sale of EPIX, our adjusted gross debt at March 31 would have been $11 billion.","Since we announced our strategic plan on February 9 and our commitment to delevering, if you take the EPIX sale into account, we reduced gross debt by $1.3 billion or approximately 10%.","We continue to be focused on strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our capital structure to support our long-term strategic objective. And we are focused on preserving our investment-grade rating by monetizing non-core assets enhancing our cash flow as well as taking other actions that will allow us to achieve our stated objectives.","Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the second half of fiscal 2017. For the June quarter, we expect continued improvement in worldwide ad sales driven by ongoing double-digit growth in international, offset by declines in domestic advertising in the low single digits, reflecting sequential improvement from the March quarter.","As for affiliate revenues in the June quarter, we expect that both domestic and international revenue will continue to grow with worldwide revenues showing sequential improvement from the March quarter. For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming spend will be in mid-single digits, including factoring in the impact of the acquisition of Telefe.","Fences will modestly benefit from our restructuring actions. For the full year, on an organic basis, we expect Media Networks SG&A expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. However, including the acquisition of Telefe, recorded SG&A expense will grow in the high single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2017, we forecast a book tax rate of approximately 31%.","We'll continue to prime this as we go through the year and get a better sense for the domestic versus international profitability mix.","With that, I'd like to turn it back to Bob to wrap it up.","Robert Bakish","Thank you, Wade. In closing, we will continue to move fast, be aggressive and be opportunistic in driving the turnaround for Viacom. Our goal is to evolve Viacom into the premier portfolio of global multiplatform entertainment brand. As we stay focused and flexible and become a partner of choice in our industry, we know that goal is well within our grasp. And as we do, we'll remain focused on growing earnings, free cash flow and delivering value for our shareholders. I know we spent time with many of you over the past few months, and we will continue to do so moving forward to ensure the dialogue continues.","Thank you for all your support. We will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Ben Swinburne","Thanks, good morning. Bob, obviously, there's a lot of concern in the marketplace about the state of the bundle. And I'm wondering if you could talk about the improvement you're expecting in affiliate revenues in the U.S. in particular, your relationships with some of the key MVPDs, particularly Charter, where, I believe, there's been some potential re-tiering.","And then for you and\/or Cyma, just on Nickelodeon. It was interesting. Hulu obviously is not carrying the network. Not a surprise. But they called out Nick's content on demand as a key part of their SVOD offers. Obviously, they see value there. How are you thinking about managing Nick's content distribution given the changing landscape?","And are there opportunities, you think, for real revenue benefits on that business in the medium term from some of these shifts, maybe touching on your strategy for SVOD with Nick, in general? Thanks.","Robert Bakish","Thanks, Ben. A bunch of questions there. But look, there's a lot going on in the industry, for sure. There was recently some data on subs that probably were seeing some softness, too. It is worth noting that, that subscribing data is differentiated by distributor. Some operators actually grew subs while others declined. So while early, it does suggest there's some execution differences going on. But I think that's also - should be a rallying cry for the industry.","We need to work together to ensure that the product and marketing better support industry performance. We're already engaging in that dialogue with really all of our partners and believe that this will probably be a catalyst for escalating those dialogues. And that, at the end of the day, is a good thing. We also think, among other things, it highlights the need for truly new consumer options. And we do think that this entertainment pack initiative fits perfectly as a low-priced entry point for some of the people that are not currently participating in the ecosystem and may have churn due to price points. So a lot going on there.","With respect to Charter, in particular, we are aware of the issue. Worth noting, it appears to affect new subs only. It's not a broad re-tiering. I read something today that suggested it might be. But suffice it to say, this is in the context of an ongoing integration there. There is a difference of opinion on what's appropriate. We have a very strong point of view and are in conversations about it and I believe this will get resolved. And again, at a macro level, we continue to be focused on partnership with Charter and where there's other conversations going on and other MVPDs and are working to build and evolve the pay-TV ecosystem.","On the Nickelodeon front, let me just touch on SVOD in general and then I'll let Cyma add some color to it. So again, we are principally focused on maintaining the value of the pay-TV ecosystem. It's why I made the decision earlier this year not to renew a set of properties with Hulu. That was something they were very interested in, to be clear. And I haven't seen Mike's commentary on that, but it doesn't surprise me because they do continue to have some product.","We have to make sure, as an industry, that we are not creating inexpensive alternatives for consumers to access our best product. And so that has very much driven our current thinking on SVOD. Clearly, within that framework, there is an opportunity to put some product in SVOD, whether it's U.S. or international. In international, there's also the dimension of country and different markets or in different places with respect to pay-TV penetration and the like. But there are some things that make sense out there. So you can expect we would have some presence, at least on some platforms, but not in a high-volume, fresh kind of way. Cyma, you might want to add to that.","Cyma Zarghami","Sure. The product that we have on Hulu right now is primarily a set of our hits that have many seasons and many episodes. And we have our own - we have a deep library of content that fuels our own channels, six of our own platforms. But as we build out our consumer products business and capabilities, it is beneficial to our hits to have them in multiple places and multiple access to the consumers. And when they work, they work almost everywhere. And performance on television is not affected at all by that performance on Hulu.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you both.","Wade Davis","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Rich Greenfield of BTIG.","Richard Greenfield","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Sort of a followup to the last one, the MVPDs, broadly, the facilities-based ones, they've struggled to create kind of more flexible bundles. They've got all of these legacy minimum distribution clauses that makes it hard to create bundles without broadcasters or without sports. But from what we can tell, it looks like they have a lot more flexibility.","They want to create so-called virtual MVPDs or over-the-top bundles where they could actually launch bundles that don't have some of the legacy sports and broadcast channels. When you talk, Bob, about kind of new skinny bundles, are these the type of things - I mean, we sense Charter has been working on one of these kind of sports-less bundles. Rutledge has been pretty outspoken about the need for lower-cost bundles. AT&T's Stephenson's done the same. Just curious, like, is that the type of thing that you think could happen from existing distributors over the course of this year?","Robert Bakish","Yes. Thanks, Rich. So we're not privy to everyone's contracts on a specific level, clearly. But your general characterization, we would agree with. We do believe there are opportunities to create these skinnier bundles. And we're in very deep conversation with one particular entity right now about exactly that. And we do believe that, as we get a breakthrough here that will be a catalyst for more. Because look, at the end of the day, when you talk to people running these distribution companies, and I have met with the CEO of every one of them, everyone acknowledges that there's a marketplace opportunity here. And that's certainly based on their own data, which we haven't seen.","It's based on international data where things exist. No one questions the opportunity. And again, I think, given what's going on in some of the - with the recent universe figures, it increases the need to provide alternative packaging options to consumers to bring them into the ecosystem. So yeah, I think there is a path where someone will create a structure that allows this to come to market, again, that's something we're working on.","By the way, that probably or potentially includes the fact that broadcast signals are accessible via antennas and that offering is integrated in. So there are things going on here. There's a little bit of complexity, but we continue to be in a lot of conversations. And I'm quite confident that we're going to get somewhere.","Richard Greenfield","Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. Could you provide a bit more color on what you're currently seeing in the domestic ad market, how pricing is trending? And I know you mentioned we should expect some sequential improvement in the June quarter. Is that excluding the Easter - the benefit of the Easter shift?","And then just a followup on the Paramount TV Studio. When you see such success as you have with 13 Reasons Why, I guess, could you just give us some color about how that may sort of maybe have an indirect benefit to the studio and your efforts there to put you more on the map? I guess, any color on that would be great.","Robert Bakish","Sure. So again, a bunch of questions there. Nice to hear from you, Alexia. On the ad market, look, we're feeling good about it. And as I indicated, we've been -- and I've personally been in a lot of conversations with the people running all the major agencies as part of a new approach to the upfront we're initiating this year, where instead of doing a single, very large presentation where we kind of broadcast information to 1,000 people, we've been sitting down in a much more intimate, kind of agency-to-agency, in some cases, client-specific setting, where it's not only sales folks, myself, it's our flagship brand presidents and talking to them about what's going on.","So we have a fair amount of read on the market. I'd say, I'm - we're definitely feeling good about it. There is, in terms of scatter market, some typical free upfront posturing. And I say this having been the Chief Operating Officer of domestic advertising sales in the kind of the first part of the 2000s. So this is not at all uncommon. I would say, big picture, the market is good. Supply is tight. I mean, that's the benefit of some of the other things that are going on. There is noise on digital, without question. And TV is well positioned. So I think the market is pretty good, and it's setting up nicely for the upfront.","As far as the comps for the June quarter and your question about Easter, Easter is worth about a point to us. It was a -- so if you look at the March quarter and the June quarter, it did -- when we have the minus 4 in the June quarter, it is equivalent to minus 3 when you adjust for Easter. So if that's your question, that's the answer. As far as Paramount goes, they're - as I said in my formal remarks, there's a lot of great stuff going on at Paramount on the television production side. It really is a great time to be in the television production business.","There is a lot of demand. And kind of one of the unique things that we have is, at Paramount, we have a deep library of stories that we're drawing on, some of them only relate to films that have been brought to market, some of them aren't. And we're really - it's early days, but we are having some great success in converting that into episodic television in a very financially attractive way to us. So I feel good about 13 Reasons. Why?","It's clearly - like I said, it's the most tweeted-about show in 2017. There's a lot of discussion on it. Wait, it is a tough topic, and there's also discussions in school. I also want to point out that it is a TV mature-rated product. It's not for young children. But it's created a lot of interest. And it's probably something that has the potential to continue. Again, we haven't announced anything on that. But does that answer your question? Or you have anything else specifically on television production?","Alexia Quadrani","No, that's very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Doug Mitchelson of UBS.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks, so much. Bob, you've already started to talk about shifts in your relationships with distributors and strategies with distributors. There's still a lot of concern for Viacom on affiliate revenue growth and the cadence. And you've talked about providing more flexibility to distributors, and a lot of investors think that means less distribution for some of your networks, which means less affiliate revenue, less ad revenue. Can you square that up? Is giving distributors more flexibility the equivalent of less affiliate revenue for Viacom?","Robert Bakish","So we've talked about not flexibility, per se, but broadening the partnership discussion. And what we mean by that specifically is, historically, our discussions were almost exclusively at renewal points and almost exclusively about - and really they were exclusively about carriage of linear fees and how much on-demand product was going to go along with that. Today, and again, we're in arranged conversations with very large MVPDs, kind of as we speak, the conversation is happening when there isn't a deal up, point one.","Point two is, it is including other topics that can provide value from Viacom to distributors. I mentioned in my remarks about these two data pilots we have going on where we're literally inserting Vantage campaigns in local avails and having MSOs benefit financially from that. Now clearly, that's early days, but I'm actually very happy to have two of those up and running already. So that's good news.","As far as carriage of networks goes, you can think of our networks come in 3 flat - 3 tiers, if you will. You have the flagships, which we talked about. You have another set of broadly distributed networks, MTV, VH1 and TV Land, which all have up ratings in the last quarter. They're doing very well. All have strong consumer franchises.","And then you have a set of, what we call, digital or suite services. The conversations that we had on that last category, historically was all about we want more distribution, more distribution. And really, that causes problems because they want services in tiers, et cetera. So we moved off that conversation. We're fine having those up there for hierarchy clients.","Our principal focus is ensuring ongoing broad distribution of - in our flagships and this other widely distributed tier. And we're missing that carriage in some places, and we're in conversations about hopefully getting that back. But it's not about a notion of being totally flexible per se to carry anything you want.","It is very much also about what Rich was talking about before, which is finding the catalyst for the entry point for this entertainment pack, because if you think about it, pay-TV has gotten very expensive. You're talking $100-plus ARPUs in a world where people have to pay for cellphones and the like and there's a lot of stress on that machine.","We fundamentally believe that a lower-price option will be pretty compelling to people. And again, so there's a lot of conversation about that. Now clearly, that doesn't involve all of our services. It would involve the suite services, at least at the most basic, widely distributed tier, maybe as an option for other tiers. But the principal opportunity is on widely distributed service.","And if you think about the Viacom brand in this, remember, we have the #1 preschool brand in the world with Nick Jr. Full Stop, the only kids channel Nickelodeon. Full stop. If MTV, which has had its bumps in the road, but I'm telling you, and I would encourage you to ask an advertising agency that have been in our upfront dinners, there's a lot of excitement coming, whether it's Promposal, [indiscernible] or the return of TRL, this thing is going somewhere.","And by the way, it's going somewhere in a not just linear way, all of these properties have, let's just call it, deep integration with non-television devices. In fact, the Promposal, we sourced hundreds of thousands of ideas off the Internet very quickly. So it's an integrated strategy. On the Comedy Central, the biggest problem with Comedy Central ratings in the last 18 months has been the transition of our late-night franchise.","John and Steve have gone away. Trevor is starting to hit his stride, and we got Jordan coming in the fall with a half hour. That's really - that should be the new going-forward block. Jordan's been in a lot of our effort. He has been in lot of our upfront dinners. He's really funny. We have high hopes for that. So Comedy, I believe, it's already highly valued. It's the only brand of its kind in media. And it's on a path to continued improvement. And then you got BET far and away, number 1 in the African-American demographic. It has the biggest share in the market.","We just did a series of upfront presentations there focusing on what they have coming up in some - in their late-night blocks, the comedy stuff, et cetera, it looks very strong. And finally, Paramount. That's a big story for us. So you think of just those six services, that's preschool to adults, including film, that's a killer block and a killer cornerstone at a really, potentially very attractive price point. So look, we got - we're working hard to work with our partners to evolve this business, but we fundamentally see opportunity here. And we're very focused on unlocking it.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks, so much, Bob.","Robert Bakish","So there's one other thing that I would say, just because in the context of Viacom, and I know there's a lot of noise on this distribution point and I get it. But really you should focus on the broad range of opportunity that we're going at our company. There is distribution to recapture, and that's valuable to us.","There is viewing share to grow, and we have a clear path to that. There is upside in domestic advertising. And that's on - based on growing our viewing share, that's based on pricing opportunity, particularly in the Spike to Paramount transition. That's based on growing our yield by continuing down the data-driven advertising path, something we're continuing to drive the industry on.","There is international, additional international opportunity, and you see we have nice momentum there and there's no question that Paramount will turn. And as we're doing that, we're building a very nice television production business to go with it, which is key to having a valuable, sustainable studio.","And then finally, there's real greenfield opportunities in digital where we have very small share, and there's obviously a lot of time spent viewing. And beyond media, what Cyma talked about, what we're doing in the hotel space, now Comedy Central, MTV are doing experiential stuff. Nickelodeon is coming next year with experiential stuff. There's a lot of opportunity there. So there's no question there's growth for Viacom as we navigate this changing world.","Doug Mitchelson","I appreciate all the color Bob.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Janedis of Jefferies.","John Janedis","Thank you. Cyma, could you talk more about how advertisers are thinking about reaching the kids in the younger demo? Is it a shift away from the TV screen? How does the toy money look broadly in? And will the original hours at Nick need to increase annually going forward, given the competition? ","Cyma Zarghami","Sure. We have a bunch of categories that are consistent across our business, right? Obviously, toys, obviously the movie studios and the market looks good at the moment. So we're very optimistic with our share being up and the large sort of percentage of the share that we have in the ad market at the moment.","And I think that the advantage to Nickelodeon and all of the ecosystem that we have built is that we are able to reach kids with mass simultaneous viewing opportunities that you really can't get anywhere else. And I think that is really one of our advantages. That, and the fact that we have an incredible stable -- an incredibly stable position at the moment and a clear path to some consistency with some real hits in the market. So we're feeling very optimistic about our position and the growth of our ecosystem, particularly on the Nick app and the Nick Jr. app.","Robert Bakish","Yes. And I'd just add to that, really, kind of echo it. If you look at Nickelodeon, where it's come over the last couple of years, you could argue, two, three years ago, it was the SpongeBob network. And Cyma and her team took that as a serious challenge a couple of years ago and built this multi-genre, multi-demographic pipeline that you're seeing coming to fruition today, and among other things, delivering 10 of the top 10 shows on kids television and having those new franchises working today.","And the top 3, by the way, aren't SpongeBob. It depends on which demographic you look at and you can get deeper than that. So that's something that you can't build overnight. And as we've been seeing the benefit of that, our share lead versus our traditional competitors of Disney and Cartoon has actually grown. And so that's momentum that I'm highly confident will continue going forward.","And when you talk about advertising, you talk about supply and demand, right? So the supply is tight, and we have a larger share than we're used to. That's a great place to be going into a selling cycle. And the demand is strong, too, because you've got a couple of key categories, and Cyma referenced them, toys, films and QSR, among others, that are also in good shape. So you put that together, that feels pretty good in the context of Nickelodeon in this upfront and having a really sustainable position in the marketplace.","Wade Davis","Last thing I'd add with respect to that kid's ad market is that the characteristics around digital and the restrictions around digital for the kid's ad markets reduce the number of alternatives that are available for advertisers who want to reach children. And so it just further creates a dynamic in which Nickelodeon is must-buy for anybody who wants to reach kids.","Robert Bakish","By the way, the other thing I would say on Nick, which I think is interesting, and it goes probably to an underlying question you have in terms of, \"Do you have to produce more stuff?\" In the last two years, the other thing that's happened is, Nickelodeon has moved to sourcing ideas globally, not just from the U.S. And in fact, as proven, that you can have hits that come from outside the U.S.","And that's very important because, a, it gets you a wider footprint of creative ideas. And b, the economics of those ideas are substantially superior to U.S.-produced ideas. So you are getting very high quality at a more attractive price point, which, on a total mix basis, helps manage your spending as you -- in this time, we've ramped episode. And again, we're in a very unique position of being able to that given our assets.","John Janedis","That's helpful, thanks. And may be if I can sneak one in for Wade. Thanks for the update on the China slate financing. As you know, there's been a lot of noise and headlines around the payment. So is the takeaway that given the upsize commitment, that the funding concerns shouldn't be an issue and that payment is on track? And does the 30% mean that there's upside to the initial $1 billion?","Wade Davis","Yes. So despite everything that's written, we've never really had concerns about payment. There is a payment schedule in the agreement, and we're going to receive cash this quarter per the schedule that was always in the agreement. And in terms of upside, yes, there is upside too from the 25% to the 30%, given that, as I said in my remarks, the deal in the aggregate still pertains to all films released in 2017. And so to the extent that there's 30%, that's upsized from what we've been incorporating into our financial statements to date.","John Janedis","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. I have one for Bob and one for Wade. Bob, now that you have time to take some cost actions, review programming schedules, look at the global footprint of the company, can you share expectations for cost growth over, let's say, the midterm, between programming and non-programming cost? And what's the right way to think about those two buckets?","Robert Bakish","Yeah. Look, we've done a lot of work over the past six months or so, including a restructuring. We're not giving guidance at this point on specific elements of the P&L. What Wade said about the restructuring is worth echoing, which is, yes, there are savings in the restructuring. And some of those savings will drop to the bottom line, but they're also really a funding mechanism as we continue to strengthen our company and that's both with respect to programming, but more specifically, with respect to expanding into places where we don't have significant participation today.","So we talked about setting up the digital business unit, which we're currently working on and building out some offerings there. So this is about - and I think a lot of this is story of Viacom, it's we're remixing. When you looked at - if you look at the brands - for the domestic brands, the pay-TV business, you're seeing our expense base getting remixed within brands.","So the context of MTV, where we're shifting our mix to be much more back towards unscripted, back to mix change that has economic implications that allows the production of more hours at same price point, for example, we're shifting the mix of spending across brands. So an example of that would be shifting spending to the Paramount Network as we re-brand Spike and do that in January and March.","And we've started with advertisers about - talking about programming that's coming. It represents a substantial investment on a single network basis, but it's being funded as a remix. So that's how you should really be thinking about it. I don't know, Wade, if you want to add anything to that.","Wade Davis","Yeah, it's really - I mean, it's funding investments in future growth, right? I mean, when we rolled out our strategy, we did get a lot of questions specifically around digital and live events as to whether or not people should think of us needing to invest significant new dollars in executing against those initiatives and the answer is no. We are taking efficiencies that we've been able to extract from other parts of the organization and have been able to reinvest the majority of those savings into initiatives that are going to generate growth in the future.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And then Wade, can you just follow up on the slate financial question? So far, first half of the year, you've seen the benefit at the studio and the ancillary line. Does that continue for the rest of the year or it - was that a first half kind of catch-up due to the slate financing?","Wade Davis","There will continue to be impact in fiscal '17. And depending on how we elect to structure certain elements of the forward slates, there may be -- there may or may not be impact in the forward years.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thank you.","Wade Davis","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","We'll go to Jessica Reif with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thanks. I have two questions. First, I just wanted to go back to the advertising topic. Given the ramp-up in programming, particularly over the summer, can you talk about how you're approaching the upfront market, which takes place before a lot of its original programming takes place? And over what period of time do you expect the new consortium, the Open AP, to really have a significant impact?","And on a completely different topic, on the film group, should we expect more restructuring charges as Jim Gianopulos comes in and brings in his own team? And is there anything, in your view, that he can do to fix the existing slate while his develops over the next, say, 18 to 24 months? If he develops his own slate, what can he do with the existing slate?","Robert Bakish","Sure. Thanks, Jessica. So in terms of the programming path and how that fits with the upfront, we have very much been talking about, as you'd expect we would, I just think it's more significant given what's going on, about our going forward programming with all the agencies- we did a studio tour, as an example, to all the studios, showcasing the new MTV, showcasing the Paramount Network. So yes, that is very much part of our upfront process and will be part of our upfront transaction.","For example, we're in conversations with advertisers about unique opportunities to participate potentially in creative ways on the relaunch or the rebrand to the Paramount Network. And there's some interest there. Absolutely, that's part of the dialogue. And certainly, we see this clear path to MTV ratings improvement. That's going to be part of the economics, if you will. In the context of Open AP, actually, I'll flip that to Wade because he's deeply involved in it and will probably give you the more precise answer.","Wade Davis","Yes. But I think your specific question is the timing of the impact -- timing and significance of the impact of Open AP. So as you probably know, that Open AP is not yet available. It won't be available until the beginning of the broadcast year. And over the course -- between now and then, we're going to continue to build participation in that. The enrolment period is open through the end of June. I guess, as of the beginning of next week, we will have met with every major network. And based on those meetings, we expect to significantly expand participation in the initiative.","In terms of the impact that we - the magnitude of the impact that we expect it to have, even though it's not currently available, in the upfront, we're seeing Open AP as a significant factor driving interest and scale around audience-based buying. And I think, probably, it's important to point out that this is something - Open AP is something that we've done in response to advertiser demand. Advertisers were asking for alignment of process and measurement to enable them to be able to take advantage of some of the advances around next-generation TV advertising, and in particular, audience-based buying.","So the fact that we're seeing very strong interest materialize in the upfront ahead of any availability from an advertisers' standpoint, which is kind of the actual expression of their early interest that generated the initiative, and the fact that we're seeing strong interest from other networks in participating in the initiative, all cause us to continue to be very optimistic about what Open AP is going to enable for us and the rest of the industry.","Robert Bakish","And then moving to Paramount, Jim, here's a couple of things. One is it goes to the execution point. There's a lot of things you have to do once you have a film so you got to distribute it. You got to market it. You have to drive ancillary value, other window values, sales, et cetera. So there's a bunch of stuff that he will certainly - and is already working on improving execution that will create value and then on the films themselves, they're not all made yet.","So even though you have a slate and you have films in production, you do screenings, you fine-tune them. And he will certainly participate in that process. So I think we will feel - I know we will feel Jim's impact. I already have. And by the way, the employees on the lot also feel and they're very excited about it. So you'll see that value begin to feather in.","Wade Davis","I would just add, more specifically, in terms of what impact we expect to see Jim to deliver on the 2018 slate. I mean, I've been extraordinarily impressed on how fast he's hit the ground running and how he's really rallied the existing team and brought in select new talent. We brought in a very senior person in television licensing. But as said, you asked the question about, \"Is he going to bring in his own new team on a wholesale basis?\" And one of the things I've been most impressed is how he has come in and immediately improved and refined certain processes that needed to be improved.","But almost most importantly, he's really jump-started the culture there and engaged the existing team in ways that are really impressive to see. And in terms of how that's likely to manifest itself, if your question about his ability to impact the '18 slate, I mean, obviously, some of the films have been made, but not all of them.","As it relates to the films that have been made, he's been very, very specific and targeted around things that he can do to improve the expected performance of those films by looking at refining the release strategy. I think, based on some of the things that he's focused on, there's significant upside in the marketing and releasing costs in certain of those films.","And it's also really important to remember that Jim's roots are in international. And as the international market becomes more important overall, that that's something that Jim is bringing increased focus and perspectives on. So all those things are examples of things that we expect to have a positive impact on '18 despite the fact that, as you point out, many, but not all, of the films have been made.","Robert Bakish","Yes. And the other thing, and maybe this is obvious, but he's really in it. He's not letting this thing fly on autopilot. He's in all facets of it, and he brings deep expertise and knowledge to the table across many, many areas. So we're very optimistic about the studio under Jim's leadership.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Right. And then just one - that was an amazing outlook, really great answer. I mean very - that's a lot of color. But the last question, should we expect any more restructuring charges from Film in the next quarter?","Wade Davis","There may be some additional restructuring charges, but they'll be very modest. So a lot of times when people see a new studio has come in, they're afraid, to your first question, that they're going to disrupt the team and the operational continuity, but also that they're just going to kind of flush a bunch of the product that they didn't have their name on. And Jim doesn't bring kind of a lot of ego to that question. He's very objective in looking at the product that he thinks is going to work and how to optimize that product from an economic point of view.","So either that's translated into kind of a very practical and targeted approach that is not - we don't anticipate anything significant. There may be - really, to the extent that there's any write-offs, they're largely going to be on projects that are in kind of a earlier, mid-stage development that Jim doesn't see the kind of potential for to actually make in the movies.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Great, thank you.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page #2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.","Sumner M. Redstone","Thank you, Jim. Thank you, all, for being with us this morning. I'm really pleased to join our leadership team to report Viacom's financial results. Our shareholders once more again benefit from our relentless focus on producing great content, operating efficiently and maximizing returns to shareholders in every single environment. As our industry continues to ever more rapidly evolve, this obsessive focus will separate Viacom from its peers and help ensure our continued leadership and many, many years in our success.","The fact of the matter is that Viacom has always been in the reinvention business. Our cable networks continue to innovate and strengthen their connections with new fans on new programs year after year. And our motion picture operations continue to bring innovative filmed entertainment to more people on more screens in more places than ever before.","Of course, the man at the center of this success is my friend Philippe Dauman. Philippe provides extraordinary leadership to Viacom's outstanding management team, and in fact, he has been at my side, creating all that I have built over the past 25 years. And I know, I'm confident he will continue to provide the same strategic insight and operating skill that will ensure Viacom's success for many, many years to come. He, in fact, is my most trusted advisor who understands my vision and has the eye as well as [ph] ability to see it through.","I'm proud to turn the call over to my forever friend, Viacom's CEO. I often refer to him as a genius and as the wisest man I ever met, and the reason is that Philippe has operated Viacom in a truly fantastically successful manner. So here \u2013 it's yours, Philippe, take it over.","Philippe P. Dauman","Thank you, Sumner. I really appreciate it, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","We know that many of you on the call today, like many of us here at Viacom, live, work or have loved ones in areas enduring the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy. We hope that you and your families were able to weather the storm and return to the normal rhythm of life that we too often take for granted. For those still trying to rebuild, we are with you. Viacom remains committed to recovery efforts, whether it's our corporate support of the American Red Cross and other relief organizations or the initiatives of our individual brands, including MTV's Restore the Shore textathon tonight. And we thank our employees who continue to support the recovery through the company and their own personal efforts.","Let's move into the discussion of our September quarter and Viacom's 2012 fiscal year. It was a year in which the company achieved success in several key areas of strategic focus even amidst challenges. Our diverse brands continue to engage and entertain audiences on every platform throughout the world. We're investing consistently in content to ensure that those brands remain vibrant, strong and well positioned to attract greater viewership as audiences evolve and measurement improves. Those investments, along with key organizational changes, are yielding progress at Nickelodeon and our other networks.","We're aggressively pursuing every sensible opportunity to monetize our Media Networks, both through advertising and distribution. For the fiscal year, we generated double-digit growth in affiliate revenue as we captured substantial value for our content with existing and emerging distributors alike. We see fees from traditional and emerging distribution platforms as an important and consistent area of growth well into the future.","We're also creating ever-greater opportunities for our content internationally, where we're fortifying the position of our core brands in Nickelodeon and MTV, expanding with COMEDY and the Paramount Channel and building our consumer products business. This is another big opportunity for future growth where Viacom is extremely well positioned. In Filmed Entertainment, Paramount Pictures enters fiscal 2013 with a remarkable slate, which will see the return of key tentpole franchises such as Star Trek and the launch of new ones, including World War Z.","Even as we increase investment for content on every screen and add programming talent to our organization, we've enhanced operational efficiency, kept a tight rein on costs, maintained a strong balance sheet and continued to generate excess free cash flow. Viacom was able to drive bottom line growth and significant increases in earnings per share for both the quarter and full year, and we continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the quarter and the full year and provide highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions.","Let's begin with the results. Viacom's revenues in the fourth quarter declined 17% to $3.36 billion with revenues in our Media Networks segment flat and revenues in our Filmed Entertainment segment down 39%, due to a different mix and lower number of releases compared to the prior year's comparable quarter. Our fiscal 2012 revenues declined 7% as a result of the decline in advertising sales in Media Networks and theatrical and home entertainment revenues and Filmed Entertainment. Media Networks revenues rose 1% for the full year, driven by an 11% increase in affiliate revenues.","In the September quarter, Viacom's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 14% to $1.21. For fiscal 2012, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.21 per diluted share, an 11% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow was nearly $2.4 billion for the fiscal year.","Fueled by our cash generation, we repurchased $700 million in stock in the September quarter under our $10 billion share repurchase program. The company repurchased a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year. In fiscal 2012, Viacom also increased its quarterly dividend 10% to $0.275 per share. As we begin fiscal 2013, we are on track to buy back at least $2.5 billion of stock this year. In the current quarter, we plan to purchase $700 million of our stock. We have consistently ranked among the top of our peers in returning capital to shareholders.","Let's take a look now at our -- at how our divisions performed in the quarter and the full year. At our Media Networks, we continue to be completely focused, completely focused on creating great content for every screen. We continue to increase our investment in programming to roll out more originals, including more new episodes of hit shows and more new franchises. In fact, a number of our core networks, including MTV, Nickelodeon, COMEDY CENTRAL, SPIKE and TV Land, are showing sequential improvement in the current quarter over our fiscal fourth quarter.","With any network portfolio, it is inevitable that some networks will be on the rise while others will be in reinvention. To be sure, the entire broadcast and cable industry is at an inflection point. Time-shifted viewing is growing more prevalent, and our networks are stretching the window for fan engagement with our shows as a result. In the fourth quarter, ratings for MTV's 10 Spot, for example, increased 34% when including DVR playback through 3 days. COMEDY CENTRAL's Tosh.0 nearly doubles its audience when including DVR playback through 3 days.","Content consumption across platforms is also growing rapidly and exceeding our ability to measure it by a greater margin than ever. We know that our audiences are viewing more video in more places than ever, but lack of comprehensive measurement remains a significant roadblock to monetization. However, we are confident that we have the right strategic mix to grow ratings in the short term by investing in original content, enhancing and empowering our creative teams, applying our deep audience insights, maximizing scheduling opportunities across screens and leveraging our unrivaled strength in social media. This will, in turn, allow us to restore more robust ad revenues as the year progresses to enhance our otherwise strong financial performance.","Across our Media Networks, we are investing in the future and making the strategic decisions, particularly in the areas of programming development, marketing and distribution that will position us as a leader in a truly convergent multi-platform world, where expanded viewership is accurately accounted for on all screens. We are not waiting for business to change. We are changing how we do business.","Earlier this week, for example, MTV announced a new addition to its creative leadership team, adding a proven hit maker as its President of Programming. This follows on the heels of Nickelodeon's moves to create centralized west coast leadership for all of its content teams and recruit new talent, particularly in animation, as it rolls out an ambitious development slate and expands across platforms. COMEDY CENTRAL is increasing original programming by 55% in the current fiscal year as it installs digital as a function in every group across the network, for an even more holistic approach to content development across platforms.","Our advertising revenues were down 6% domestically and 7% worldwide for the quarter. We were able to achieve modest sequential improvement in our domestic advertising revenue performance despite the 10-day blackout of our channels on DIRECTV, which effectively canceled out the benefit of the BET Awards moving into the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, ad revenues declined 4% domestically and 5% worldwide. In the current quarter, we're seeing pricing up in the mid-teens over the upfront and scatter-versus-scatter pricing up in the mid-single-digits year-over-year. Advertiser demand for our content is there, and we are in a position to quickly monetize ratings improvement as it takes hold.","In distribution, affiliate revenues increased 12% domestically and 11% worldwide in the fourth quarter. For the full year, affiliate revenues increased to 10% domestically and 11% worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed several distribution agreements in which we secured significant rate increases.","As previously noted, we struck a long-term agreement with DIRECTV, securing a healthy rate of increase. We also entered into a deal to provide EPIX films for the Amazon Prime subscription streaming service. In the current quarter, we renewed and expanded our agreement with Hulu, adding Tr3s at a limited offering from Nickelodeon to the Hulu Plus subscription service. We also made our content available for download to own through the Nook Video service.","Additionally, we increased distribution with existing affiliates, which launched TV Land and MTV 2 in HD in the fourth quarter. In the current quarter, we significantly expanded our TV Everywhere partnerships with distributors by rolling out our video-on-demand websites for ATT U-Verse, Time Warner Cable and DIRECTV subscribers.","Despite some rating softness, MTV continues to connect with its core 12- to 34-year-old demo, an audience with whom it scores 4 of the top 15 cable series more than any other network, including Teen Mom, Awkward, Snooki & JWOWW and Teen Wolf. The network remained #1 in the demo among ad-supported cable networks in its critical 10 Spot programming slot. In the current quarter, MTV has a solid mix of returning hits and new originals in its 10 Spot lineup, anchored by Jersey Shore and Teen Mom 2. In its final season to date, Jersey Shore has been the #1 cable telecast on Thursdays in its demo. Leading into the series finale on December 20, MTV will air a week of countdown programming celebrating the event.","Teen Mom 2 returned on Monday this week, a new night from which the hit series will jump-start the network's lineup each week and drew 3.4 million total viewers, up from the final season of Teen Mom and outpacing the Teen Mom 2 season finale. MTV will air seasons 3 and 4 of Teen Mom 2 back-to-back for the first time, giving fans new episodes of the series through April of 2013. Teen Mom 2 will serve as a platform to launch several new series debuting through next quarter, including Catfish, a reality look at identity and truth in the social media age, which premiered Monday to an average audience of 2.7 million total viewers and ranked as the highest-rated 11 p.m. show premier in MTV history.","We've spoken at length about our efforts to reinvigorate Nickelodeon, and I'm pleased to report that those efforts are yielding results, with viewership stabilizing and a continued infusion of new original programming coming to air. By addressing ratings issues, half hour by half hour, Nick has made improvements across the schedule and is now flat to up in several day parts, including preschool.","The network has reclaimed its leadership of Saturday mornings among kids 2 to 11, thanks to new episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants and the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which ranked as the highest-rated animated launch on the network since 2009. For 4 straight weeks, SpongeBob has stopped all of television and Ninja Turtles has won its time period by double digits with the critical 2 to 11 audience. The Ninja Turtles consumer products line has also been selling very well with our partner Playmates managing out-of-stock situations for action figures and selling out additional items rapidly. We expect brisk sales to continue.","From SpongeBob to Avatar, our history has shown that top animated programs typically continue to build audiences over time. So the strength of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the gate, in addition to the success of its consumer products line and the anticipation for the forthcoming live-action feature from Paramount, give us great encouragement that Nickelodeon has a lasting and lucrative hit on its hands.","Additionally, new seasons of returning programs, including iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush, had strong premieres in the fourth quarter and continue to perform well in the current quarter. The iCarly one-hour series finale airs Thanksgiving weekend and is among a greater number of event programs throughout the current quarter, including Christmas specials from SpongeBob and Fairly OddParents. Event programming is a consistent and critical ratings driver for Nickelodeon, and you'll see more and more of it from the network.","On COMEDY CENTRAL, new episodes of Tosh.0 and Workaholics performed well with the network's young male audience in the fourth quarter. COMEDY CENTRAL's newest hit, Key & Peele, solidified its place in the cultural zeitgeist. And in late night, Jon and Stephen again proved to be strong as they held leadership in late night across all of television with men 18 to 34. As I mentioned earlier, COMEDY is increasing its original programming significantly, including the launch of 6 new series in the first half of the 2013 calendar year.","VH1 continued its ratings rise as the network increased its viewership in primetime by 19% among adults 18 to 49 in the fourth quarter. Monday nights on VH1 remain particularly strong with women viewers. During the summer, VH1 was the #1 network with women 18 to 49 for 13 consecutive weeks, thanks to hits Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta and Single Ladies. The network is building on its momentum with the introduction of a new Friday night comedy block in January, which will feature The Jenny McCarthy Show and the return of Best Week Ever. Hit series Mob Wives and La La's Full Court Life return with new seasons in January as well.","BET saw success in the fourth quarter with its gospel original series, SUNDAY BEST, which has its best season to date, and 106 & Park, which the network has given a refreshed look and new hosts. In the current quarter, the BET Hip Hop Awards drew 3.1 million viewers, and BET's new reality series, Keyshia & Daniel: Family First, successfully premiered with 2.9 million viewers. In the current quarter, BET will air the 2012 Soul Train Awards later this month. And next quarter, we'll see the return of the network's hit originals, The Game and Let's Stay Together.","TV Land had a solid quarter with total day ratings up 5% year-over-year at the network's core 25 to 54 demo. In the current quarter, TV Land will look to build on that momentum with the return of Hot In Cleveland and Happily Divorced later this month.","As SPIKE prepares for its much-anticipated debut of Bellator mixed martial arts in January, it continues to build out its lineup of originals. Returning series Auction Hunters and Bar Rescue showed momentum with Bar Rescue achieving double-digit ratings gains over its first season. In the current quarter, Tattoo Nightmares was SPIKE's highest-rated series premiere among viewers 18 to 49 in nearly 2 years.","CMT made progress in the fourth quarter by updating its afternoon and primetime lineup with new acquisitions, including Reba. In the current quarter, the season 2 premiere of Redneck Island last Saturday attracted more than 1.4 million viewers and stands as the highest-rated season premiere in CMT history.","Moving now to international. Our international Media Networks improved both its operating income and margins in the fourth quarter despite the volatile economic environment abroad, particularly in Europe. We continue to drive strong growth in affiliate sales through organic growth, new channel launches and, to a lesser extent than prior quarters, digital distribution. Our continued strength in affiliate sales internationally, combined with significant cost management, have enabled Viacom International Media Networks to mitigate softness in advertising and ancillary sales due to the economic factors mentioned earlier.","In fiscal 2012, we made great progress in driving the reach and success of our adults-focused business abroad, a key priority for international. Ratings at COMEDY CENTRAL increased nearly 30% internationally for the full year, and this month saw the launch of COMEDY across several markets in Southeast Asia. The launch marks a major milestone in our effort to establish COMEDY as our third truly global brand alongside MTV and Nickelodeon.","In the current quarter, fans around the world cast a record-breaking 184 million votes to decide the winners of last Sunday's 2012 MTV European Music Awards, and early results indicate that the broadcast grew its estimated TV reach in Europe by 15% over last year's strong ratings. We are on track to achieve our goal of 20% plus margins in our international networks in fiscal 2013.","Finally, let's take a look at our Filmed Entertainment segment. The fourth quarter closed a fiscal year in which Paramount Pictures took reasoned and decisive action to manage its release schedule and give its films maximum global visibility in theaters, even as it aggressively managed costs behind the screen, all of which resulted in higher profitability. The studio continues to demonstrate significant long-term progress in enhancing its margins.","In our fiscal 2013, Paramount has as diverse and promising a slate as we've seen from any studio in recent years, including star-driven tentpoles, prestige films and the type of highly targeted, high-margin releases it pioneered with the Paranormal Activity franchise. Indeed, Paranormal Activity returned to theaters in the current quarter with its fourth installment, which has grossed more than $50 million to-date at the box office and set the stage for a fifth Paranormal next Halloween.","Paramount also released Flight, which earned rave reviews for the performance of 2-time Oscar winner, Denzel Washington, and has had 2 strong weekends at the box office for cumulative gross of more than $50 million. The studio has an additional 5 films hitting theaters through the end of the quarter, including: a Tom Cruise action vehicle, Jack Reacher; The Guilt Trip, starring Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand; David Chase's Not Fade Away; and DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians.","To wrap up, Viacom delivered significant value for shareholders in fiscal 2012. Our consistent investment in content will continue as we enter a new year, and our audiences will see it on every screen, on our television channels around the globe, on the web, on tablets and mobile devices and on the big screens in theaters worldwide.","As we deepen engagement and drive ratings, we'll continue to connect marketers with our audiences and advance distribution through innovative and fruitful partnerships. At the box office, Paramount Pictures will serve movie-going audiences with a deep and diverse slate that will drive theatrical revenue through the year. Our entire organization will continue to strive toward creative excellence, operational excellence and effective cost management. And as a result, we will deliver on our commitment to continue to maximize free cash flow and return capital to shareholders.","Thank you again for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy.","James W. Barge","Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter. Our 10-K will be filed shortly.","This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's September quarter excludes $17 million of discrete tax benefit. Last year's September quarter adjusted results excluded restructuring charges of $130 million on a pretax basis and $90 million after tax, as well as $52 million of discrete tax benefit.","Now let's take a look at our segment results. In our Media Networks segment, revenues of $2.3 billion in the quarter were in line with the prior year. Domestic revenues increased 1%, and international revenues were down 6%. Foreign exchange had a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.","Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 6% in the quarter. International advertising declined 14%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 5 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter, as well as softness in Europe.","In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 12% while international revenues were up 3%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 5 percentage points. Excluding the impact of the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter.  International affiliate growth reflects revenues from new channel launches, as well as rate in subscriber increases.","Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 4% in the quarter, primarily due to lower consumer product licensing and home entertainment revenues.","Expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Within expenses, the programming expense grew 9% while SG&A expense declined 7%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense and savings realized from our 2011 restructuring.","Media Networks adjusted operating income of $933 million in the quarter was down 3% as compared to the September quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 100 basis points compared to the prior year.","Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 39% to $1.1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 83% to $131 million in the quarter. As anticipated, the studio faced difficult comparison to the September quarter of last year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers: Dark of the Moon, as well as the release in the quarter of Captain America: The First Avenger. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 32% to $345 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter, including a difficult comparison to last year's release of Transformers 3.","TV license fees increased 19% to $464 million. The increase in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in the pay TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 21% to $147 million in the quarter due to higher digital revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $195 million in the quarter as compared to income of $185 million last year.","Now moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $13 million in the quarter. Losses in the quarter principally relate our investment in EPIX. On a full year basis, EPIX was profitable.","The reported tax rate in the quarter was 31%. The reported rate was favorably impacted by $17 million of discrete tax benefits. For fiscal year 2012, the adjusted effective tax rate was 34.0%.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas E. Dooley","Thank you, Jimmy. Today I'm going to touch on our full year results, as well as talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year.","Now turning to the full year results. Media Networks generated revenue of $9.2 billion and adjusted operating income of $3.9 billion. Affiliate revenues grew 11% for the year, and advertising revenue declined 5%. Media Networks' margins of 42% increased 20 basis points over the prior year. The international part of our Media Networks business generated approximately $270 million of profitability for the year and achieved high-teens operating margins. Filmed Entertainment generated revenues of $4.8 billion and adjusted operating income of $325 million. This translates to an operating margin of 7%. As Philippe mentioned, we generated full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.21 and $2.4 billion in operating free cash flow.","Also, we continue to be aggressive in returning capital to our shareholders. For the full year, we repurchased 60 million of our shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 billion. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion of capital back to our shareholders, which is a return-on-market capitalization of approximately 14%. If you look back to when we started our buyback program 2 years ago, we had 609 million shares outstanding. Since then, we have repurchased a total of 121 million of our shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $5.6 billion, which brings our shares outstanding to 502 million as of November 7.","Now moving on to our debt. For the most part, it's fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress in lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end.","In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.1 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $848 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. At September 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Last week, we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility that increased the size from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and extended the maturity 2 years to November of 2017.  This action reflects the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with significant financial flexibility for the next 5 years.","Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, for fiscal 2013, we continue to see growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will fluctuate, given that the recognition on some of our digital agreements is tied to product availability. Accordingly, in the December quarter, we expect that the reported affiliate revenue growth will be in the low single digits, which is a combination of lower digital revenues and double-digit growth in traditional revenues.","For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the high single digits. Given the timing of shows coming on air, growth will be weighted to the first half of the year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve or enhance our margins.","At Filmed Entertainment, in the December quarter, we anticipate a greater loss than in the prior year. This is primarily due to difficult comparisons in the home entertainment marketplace. The prior year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers 3, as well as releases in the quarter, which included Super 8 and Captain America. However, the studio should see healthy growth in profits in the back half of the fiscal year as they benefit from the availabilities of titles in TV and home entertainment marketplaces.","For 2013, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. We expect cash taxes to be similar to book taxes for the year.","As for our stock buyback program, as Philippe mentioned, we plan to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the December quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for fiscal 2013.","Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline, on November 21, Paramount will be disturbing DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. For the holidays, the studio will release the comedy, Guilt Trip on December 19, starring Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen and which is produced by Lorne Michaels. And on December 21, they will release Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the best-selling book series. In addition, Paramount Vantage will be releasing the film Not Fade Away from David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos.","As we look into 2013, we have a number of 3D releases. In January, the studio will release Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which stars Jeremy Renner, and in March, they will release G.I. Joe: Retaliation. The next installment of Star Trek, which is directed by J.J. Abrams, follows in May, and in June, Paramount will release World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt.","Now looking at Paramount's development, they are currently in production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Russell Crowe, as well as a new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role. The studio is also in development on the Michael Bay-directed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and on a SpongeBob movie. They are planning a fourth installment of Transformers, as well as a fifth installment of our low-budget Paranormal Activity franchise. If you look at our 4 Paranormal films, which have released to date, they have cost only $27 million to produce and have generated over $700 million in worldwide box office.","In summary, we continue to focus on organic investment, disciplined management of our cost structure and returning capital to our shareholders. At Media Networks, we remain committed to strengthening our brands through increased investment, as well as by growing the level of original programming on our networks across all platforms and devices. And we look forward to the day when total content consumption is more accurately measured. At Paramount, we have developed several tentpole franchises and are excited about our upcoming slate and pipeline. We continue to seek ways to reduce our capital commitment in the business in order to enhance our margins, as well as our returns. And we are committed to aggressively returning capital to our shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.","I want to thank you for listening. And now, operator, we'll turn the call over to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony DiClemente, Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I think investors are, in some ways, pleasantly surprised by the lack of correlation between the level of some of your ratings declines in the past quarter and the level of your domestic advertising decline, which hasn't been as dramatic of a decline. So just wondering if, maybe Tom and Philippe, if you could remind us of some of the reasons why ratings haven't correlated as directly with advertising trends, why advertising hasn't quite been as bad as linear ratings declines. And you guys have been more aggressive on TV Everywhere, particularly with current release windows than your peers. And so, clearly, that's probably one of the reasons they don't correlate. And, Tom, you mentioned the measurement, and you look forward to a day that those digital viewers can be measured more accurately. So any update on measurement in that way for TV Everywhere would also be helpful.","Philippe P. Dauman","I'll start, Anthony. Look, there's never been a linear correlation between ratings and ad sales in discrete periods of time. Naturally, over the long term, you have to rebuild your ratings. Where we focus on is working very closely with our major marketing partners. We do get a pickup from the C3 measurement in many cases, and so it's a question of mix. We have the ability to shift units from DR to paid advertising. So we operate at all times to maximize the available ad dollars. The good news for us is that as ad  -- as ratings improve, we can pretty quickly monetize those improved ratings because of the under-delivery that we have experienced over the period of weakness that is starting to lift. As far as TV Everywhere and measurement, we believe that in the long term, in order for our whole industry to succeed, we have to provide consumers, and particularly our young audiences, with the content they want on the gadgets and platforms and the places they want it. And we're going to do it in a way that intelligently manages the windows and work with our marketers to ensure that we monetize that viewing, a part of it is measurement. And we are working with Nielsen and others to ensure that, that measurement improves over time. And I'm convinced that we're going to see gradual improvement of that; not as fast as we would like, but it will improve. And in the meantime, we are demonstrating to our major marketers the kind of additional viewing we are getting on the content that they are in partnership with us on. And as they understand that, that cements the relationship we have with them and, going back to the beginning of your question, allows us to maximize our advertising revenues even in the face of weak ratings in some of our networks.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then my understanding was that you and Nielsen and some of your peers are working on mobile device measurement in the home. That's in beta for Nielsen. And there was some talk that it would be operational perhaps the early part of the calendar year. Is that possible? Like can you give us a specific update on that?","Thomas E. Dooley","Yes. There are those -- there are conversations on that, and that is one timeline that's on the table. Whether that will be met is up in the air. I can't comment on how aggressive or unaggressive that timeline might be. But, Anthony, we also look forward to the day -- Facebook and Google actually bill based on delivered impressions, and I think there's opportunities down the road for traditional media to begin to go down that road. And that would be an exciting new day. Add that to the possibility of dynamic commercial insertion, where commercials are inserted at the time when the content is consumed, which in today's day and age, based on video-on-demand and all the technologies that are available to deliver our content discretely to a consumer, you got to get very excited about that, that power of that concept and that delivery capability. When is that going to take place? That's over the next 12 to 24 months that those technologies really begin to hit the marketplace very quickly, and that changes a lot of the dynamics in the advertising marketplace and the content measurement marketplace. So we're real excited about that, because we know our content is being consumed aggressively by the younger audiences that we deliver across many devices where measurement isn't completely captured.","Operator","We'll go next Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2 for Philippe. Philippe, firstly, over the years, you've talked a bit about forward trends. You gave us scatter versus scatter pricing on -- and how you guys capitalize on ratings game better. But do you want to talk a bit about what you see in the current fourth quarter, if it's accelerating, decelerating or staying the same? And if not, why won't you comment about the fourth quarter? And then secondly, in the past, I asked you about changes of programming talent, and you guys did. You brought Susanne Daniels in. What do you think she brings to the job and what vision -- what direction you think she'll take MTV?","Philippe P. Dauman","Michael, as far as the current quarter, we're continuing to look to sequential improvement in our ad revenues. We're still climbing back up. I don't expect that this quarter will see us get into positive territory, but we'll see improvement. And we are going to strive very hard to get back into positive territory as the year progresses and continue to improve from there. And as I mentioned earlier, there is going to be a correlation to the continued trend in ratings improvement. As far as Susanne Daniels, we're very excited. We've had our eye on her for a long time, and we're very pleased that she has committed to coming with us and devoting her total energy to the exciting programming we have in place. And she will bring with her, and you'll see announcements in the near future, some additional talent who will bring to bear more development in both the reality and scripted areas. So we've got a good pipeline now, and this will only turbo charge it. And likewise, we have continued to add talent across many other networks. I talked about Nickelodeon, talked about how we changed the structure of the organization, but we've also infused the Nickelodeon organization with new outside talent. From Disney, we recently have made a significant hire from Disney and from other places. So we are centrally focused at our company on bringing in great programming talent, developing more series and different genres across all of our networks. Because if we do that, that drives everything else.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple for Tom. Tom, can give us any more details on what needs to happen execution-wise to preserve cable network margins in fiscal '13? You said that you'd be able to offset advertising pressure and programming cost investment?","Thomas E. Dooley","Yes. I mean, Doug, we're working all the time to try and drive down the net investment that we do to kind of fill out the program mix around everything else, the making what goes on in the screen. That includes everything from the financial areas to the production areas that uplink onto satellites and deliver our signals around the world. Technology has begun to benefit us in that regard in terms of cost savings and in terms of the number of folks we have do it. We've made some significant investments, both in the financial side and the distribution side, to basically drive our cost efficiencies there. Those have happened over the last several years. And they're beginning to pay dividends, and I expect them to pay dividends into the next couple of years. So we're pretty excited about that, and that gives us confidence that we'll be able to save money in other areas of the company.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And am I right in thinking that you'll get further compensation from Disney for the stronger-than-expected performance of The Avengers and that you did not accrue any of that benefit in fiscal '13?","Thomas E. Dooley","That is correct, and that movie did very well for them and will also benefit us.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you'll book that on a cash basis? When would that be...","Thomas E. Dooley","We took it on when they report the receipts to us, and we have a good estimate as to what that number might be.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So I'm right that -- sorry, that wasn't during fiscal '12, right?","James W. Barge","It'll be in '13.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In '13, yes. Okay.","Thomas E. Dooley","And some will flow over into '14 when [indiscernible] has the results flow in.","Operator","We'll go to Richard Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","On an organic basis, it looks like your ad revenue, domestically, down 6%, was the worst you experienced during the year. I think if you organically trace back the last few quarters, you were down 3.5%, a little less than 1% and 3% in the past 3 quarters. How do you think about the network and channel kind of put and take when you look at that down 6% in the quarter? What were the key pluses within that number? What were the key minuses from a network standpoint really driving those results? And then just, Tom, you mentioned, I think, that you expected the non-digital piece of affiliate fee to be up double digits in fiscal Q1. When you look at the full year, if you excluded digital from all of fiscal 2013, could you actually get to double digits for the traditional portion of your affiliate fee?","Philippe P. Dauman","Rich, Philippe. As far as the components of the ad revenue, it's what we've been talking about. I mean, obviously, Nickelodeon -- the softness in Nickelodeon ratings in the quarter hit us pretty hard. We had some ratings softness in some of our other networks, which contributed to it. That's why it's so important that we turn that around. And as we look forward, we should see improvement. And we like to look forward, and I feel better about the steps that we have taken to build a foundation for growth in the future. As far as affiliate revenues, as we talked about, we enjoy strong so-called traditional affiliate revenues, as well as an increment of digital revenues. We don't break that down precisely. We project the usual year-after-year high single-digit to low double-digit growth. As I've said before, I expect that in this 2013, it's likely, on domestic affiliate revenue growth, that we will hit the mark we did last year. Last year, we did 10% growth in domestic affiliate revenues. I think that's what we're likely to do in fiscal 2013, and that will include very high growth in -- within that range in traditional affiliate revenues and continued development of new sources of revenues on the digital side.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up. When you talk about Nickelodeon, I think everyone's aware that Nickelodeon was down sharply in the quarter, given its ratings challenges. But when you look across your other networks, were there actually any of your key networks that actually grew ad revenue year-over-year or were down substantially less than the reported 6%? Just trying to get a feel for where you really were outperforming that overall down 6%.","Philippe P. Dauman","Sure. When you look at networks like BET and COMEDY, TV Land improving, there's a number of our networks that performed better.","Thomas E. Dooley","It's a wide range of outcomes. Some of them performed as good as high-teens, mid-teens and then some were low single digits and then some were negatives. So it was pretty widely spread.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I was curious if you could talk about the current volumes you're experiencing in the scatter marketplace, how that's pacing versus last year same period. And then separately, there was talk at one point about Sony Pictures and you brother [ph] CBS at one point, but I'm curious, when we think about an asset like that, that maybe comes up for sale, how do you think about whether or not something of that scale makes sense to pursue versus just continuing to return cash to shareholders?","Philippe P. Dauman","Brian, could you just repeat the first part of the second question.","James Bombassei","Yes, we didn't hear you. It was garbled.","Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Sorry, it was a question around Sony Pictures as an example of a large-scale M&A opportunity that may be in the market at some point. The question is really just if a large asset like that were, in fact, available, how you would think about the trade-off between such a transaction versus returning capital.","Philippe P. Dauman","Well, as I've said before, in looking at the universe of available acquisitions out there, I continue to not see any large scale acquisition that makes sense for Viacom. We have a lot to do in growing organically. We have the brands. We have the resources. We have a lot of opportunities. We are living in a world where the media business is transitioning. We are extremely well positioned to grow in that transition because we have a deeper understanding of the young audiences that are driving that transition than any media group out there. So we have opportunities to grow with them on multiple platforms. We have opportunities to grow internationally. We may have some discrete small-priced M&A opportunities that are almost operational investments, particularly in the international arena where it makes sense. But we just have so much opportunity that's more -- that creates more value than large M&A, which, as you know, has a number of pitfalls generally associated with them. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders. As far as the scatter marketplace with our marketing clients, there is demand out there. We don't have a demand issue on our networks. We've -- what we've had, we've experienced is a supply issue, meaning ratings. So we are engaging in self-help. We are going to create the supply, create the inventory, so that we can capture the demand that we have out there so that we can take the demand, take the dollars in. And that's why it's so important for us to focus on building our programming and building our ratings, scheduling segment by scheduling segment, network by network.","Operator","We'll go next to Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. Wanted to ask a little bit more about the tone of the ad market. To what degree were the results in the quarter affected by -- do you think by the Olympics or the election? And to what extent are -- is the current quarter affected by fiscal cliff fears or Hurricane Sandy? A little bit of color on any categories that are weak and strong. It would seem that auto sales are resilient and maybe kids movie release slate is weak.","Philippe P. Dauman","Look, we're not going to look for external excuses on our ad sales. There are a lot of factors that go in and out. A lot of people have talked about them. Last quarter, of course, Olympics affected the media industry. There are always concerns of one kind or another. Again, we're going to focus on what we can control. We're going to build our ratings at Nickelodeon, at MTV, every one -- at BET, COMEDY CENTRAL, every one of our networks. There's money out there. And whatever happens in the world, we are going to succeed, deliver bottom line results whatever the economic conditions are out there.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Well, if I could ask a separate question. You have great sales of the Mutant Ninja license merchandise. I was wondering if you could talk about the materiality of that and the degree to which we might see that affect the December quarter versus the September quarter.","Philippe P. Dauman","The consumer product initiative, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, will enhance our bottom line. It will start to rebuild our consumer product and ancillary sales, which have, of course, suffered some declines, not just because of the macroeconomic environment, but also because DVD sales, which were a component of our television business, have been declining along with everything else. But we've -- we're getting to the point of bottoming out on that, and the consumer product franchise Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will continue to build the bottom line. It's not significantly material. But it's nice, steady business, high-margin business that we will grow, not just in the U.S. but significantly internationally. So we will build on that. We think the Turtles are a long-term franchise to add to SpongeBob and iCarly and Dora, and we have others to layer onto that.","Operator","We'll go next to Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","I guess my first question on the film studio. Can you talk about how you ended up with what appears to be a major void on your summer schedule? I know some of that has to do with your decision to move G.I. Joe. So in hindsight, I'm trying to get a sense of how -- what other positions might have contributed to that, understanding that comparisons were a major factor in the studio's results. But any color on that would be helpful. I also have a follow-up question.","Philippe P. Dauman","Sure, Tuna. Yes, we aim at Paramount to develop and distribute approximately 15 pictures a year. And as we develop those, we look for the optimal scheduling. We look at what our competitors are doing. If a schedule gets overly crowded, we don't want to beat our heads against the wall. We try to find a place where we can optimize the results and bottom line of our films. As far as the G.I. Joe, which you specifically mentioned, we also saw an opportunity there to go into 3D, which opens up for us several significant international markets. And along with a good release day, we think that will enhance that bottom line for that particular movie.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay. Separately, with regard to your ad revenue, you've talked about how you're striving to mitigate that in all of the programming investments. Seem like some of them is starting to pay off. But there's been some concerns about the level of your ad loads across your channels, which are trending higher, seems like most of your peers. Wondering how much of a concern that could be in terms of is that a short-term measure? Or you view that as a temporary lever that you can pull? Or was pretty much you expect that that's pretty much going to be the normalized levels even when your ratings start to improve? So any color on that and what you're hearing would be helpful.","Philippe P. Dauman","Look, we -- it's just of the many tools that any network has. And we look at ad loads, we look at how much promotional and tour [ph] we put on, we try to optimize it all. You have to promote your new shows, and we look at it network by network. And it's a decision that our network leaders look at, and you try to get the optimal mix. So you'll see that vary from year-to-year and from network to network any given year.","Thomas E. Dooley","And they've been reduced a lot since that story was written. And the ultimate way to reduce the ad loads and the necessity for ad loads, where we're just trying to fulfill the commitments we've made to our advertisers, is to improve the ratings around the shows which those ads run in. So I mean, that is the goal. As Philippe articulated before, we're well on our way to achieving that.","Operator","We'll go next to the Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Philippe, there's this fear out there that MTV is broken. And so I was just wondering if you can comment on how you can, I guess, fix this like you're fixing Nickelodeon.","Philippe P. Dauman","It is not broken. It's highly successful. Just this past Monday, we -- as I mentioned in my remarks, Catfish, which we premiered at 11:00, which, as you know, for MTV is part of their primetime, was the highest-rated launch in MTV history. So MTV is very healthy indeed. We have a great development pipeline, and we have just added one of the major talents in our business, addressing young audiences, Susanne Daniels. So I have no concern about MTV's vitality as we go forward.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then my second question, just addressing another fear, is that there may be a possibility that your share buyback falls below $2.5 billion if ratings trends don't improve, specifically at MTV. But is it safe...","Philippe P. Dauman","We will buy at least $2.5 billion of our stock in 2013.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple questions. On your guidance for the growth in programming expense in fiscal 2013, do you think those dollars skew a bit more toward MTV this coming year, given your change in management there and given the programming and ratings there? I'm trying to get a sense if you feel the heavy lifting behind Nickelodeon is sort of behind you, and you're beginning to see the benefits of those dollars spent, but still investments are needed in other networks.","Philippe P. Dauman","We look -- we're investing in all of our networks across the board. There's also, Alexia, a mix issue in some of our networks we have, who license third-party programming. Those licenses come to an end. Those dollars can be reinvested, in some cases, without increasing the programming spend. That makes money available within that average of programming expense growth, money available for some of the networks that need more incremental investments. Certainly, no secret that Nickelodeon has been one of those networks that we're investing in. A lot of it, as Tom indicated in his remarks, is, in terms of the impact you will see in the first half of this 2013 year, front-end loaded to reflect all the programming we've been putting on that we talked about. So we look at all the situations. And we are fortunate to have a portfolio of networks, and we can do what is necessary for all of our networks. And we do invest, as appropriate, in each of our networks, because that is the lifeblood of our company. We do not hold back on any network to the extent it needs more program development.","Thomas E. Dooley","Alexia, we also -- we amortize our programming very aggressively and, certainly in contrast to some of our peers, on an accelerated basis. So as we ratchet up to a level, we have a point in time where it does increase to a level. But once it's at that level, it's constantly providing a new source of programming investment because it's amortized so quickly. So I think that's a bit of a distinction between us and, from what I understand, some of our competitors do.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And can you just remind us if you have renewals, both traditional and digital, in fiscal '13?","Philippe P. Dauman","Yes, we don't publicize our renewals. We prefer, except when it's -- we're forced to go public, as we did in the DIRECTV dispute. We prefer to do business with our partners confidentially, quietly. And what we can tell you is that we're very confident that we can continue to achieve greater growth in affiliate revenues as we discussed earlier.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"21982":["Viacom, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.","James Bombassei","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Philippe Dauman, our Executive Chairman, President, and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.","Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Philippe.","Philippe Dauman","Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Viacom's third quarter earnings call. As you know, since our last call, we have been subject to controversy relating to governance which has obviously created an overhang for our company. Last week, courts in Massachusetts and Delaware rejected motions to dismiss allowed discovery to proceed and scheduled trials to take place in October. We view these favorable court rulings as positive steps that move us ahead to a resolution. In light of the litigation, we won't be able to comment further on this topic during today's call.","Meanwhile, Viacom continues to focus on making progress against our strategic plans. We are increasing our investments in more and more original content across multiple platforms, extending our lead in sophisticated data products, building engaging new consumer experiences through innovative, thoughtful distribution partnerships, as well as new consumer products, recreation and hospitality initiatives, expanding our formidable international presence; and forging new strategic paths, including a potential partnership to unlock the value of Paramount and provide competitive advantages for the studio and Viacom overall.","These initiatives are the most recent manifestation of a careful, comprehensive and consistent vision for Viacom that we've pursued since I became CEO in 2006 to focus on original content, enhance our distribution revenues and build a robust international business while adapting to change. That job is never done, nor is it easy.","There are disruptive challenges in our industry, particularly for those companies like Viacom that focus on younger demographics. But we are having increasing success at several of our brands and we are leveraging those learnings to accelerate that success at other properties. Wade and Tom will go into the numbers in a moment. First, let me review some of the drivers of our results for the quarter and what lies ahead.","In ad sales, we concluded a strong upfront. More advertisers committed early instead of waiting for the scatter market later when inventory is scarce. This movement and ratings progress at core networks, as well as our new advertising products resulted in mid to high-single digit price and volume increases. Our end-to-end data-driven marketing solutions continue to help us lead the way in advanced advertising and our proprietary predictive engine, Vantage, is even more demand by sophisticated marketing partners. We expected to triple the number of Vantage deals from last year to this year and we exceeded that goal. In this upfront, we will secure 35 to 40 Vantage deals with our partners. Significantly, more than half are based on comScore metrics, signaling a welcome market shift to alternative currencies.","In addition, we held the industry's first-ever datafront where we showcased our data capabilities and announced Vantage intent powered by longtime partner American Express. This exclusive, unprecedented collaboration resulted in the first product to tap American Express' unique data using predictive analytics to help marketers reach consumers even earlier in their purchase consideration process.","These are all powerful examples of how we have transformed our company over the last several years. On the affiliate side, in the third quarter, we saw long-term deals with both DISH and Cox, both with solid annual rate increases. The decline in affiliate revenues was impacted by several factors, including the lapping of a large SVOD deal last year. As we disclosed in June, we expected to complete a significant SVOD agreement in the third quarter of this year, but recent uncertainty, coupled with our evaluation of various new distribution opportunities, have led to a slowdown of these discussions.","As we have discussed, despite the continuing impact of changing audience behaviors and preferences, I am pleased to say that in the June quarter we've stabilized our ratings and several of our networks are leading the industry in their categories. Viacom holds six of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks; and our family of networks captures the most share in nearly every demo, 2-plus, 2-11, 2-49 and most importantly, 18-49 and 18-34; and through the five weeks of the fourth quarter, our revenue weighted ratings are up.","Among viewers 2-plus, in the third quarter, VH1 delivered the biggest ratings gain of any of the 30 largest non-news cable networks; and Nick Jr. had the largest year-over-year ratings increase of any rated network. And we're also seeing strong traction across platforms. Viewership on our mobile apps is up 26% over the third quarter of last year.","Nickelodeon's story is a highlight and a perfect example of our strategy across the company to broaden our revenue base and drive audience engagement. Nickelodeon's ratings increased 6% in the quarter and it extended its number one ranking among kids 2 to 11 to 52 straight weeks, increasing an already substantial lead to over 20% over our biggest competitor in the quarter in that demo.","And the best news is that much of Nickelodeon's success is driven by a broad lineup of popular programming that is new and fresh from a variety of genres, including animation, live action and preschool. Leading the way is Henry Danger, which is the quarter's number one show among kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11 averaging 2.4 million total viewers per episode.","Nick's newest animated series, The Loud House, has become a runaway hit and is averaging almost 2 million viewers per episode. In the current quarter, Kids' Choice Sports outpaced last year's strong performance, up double-digits; and like all of Nickelodeon's tentpole events continues to be an extremely attractive opportunity for advertisers. On digital platforms, Nick continues to see strong year-over-year growth in video viewing, up almost 20% for the quarter across Nick and Nick Jr. sites and apps.","Moving to the consumer products world, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Blaze and The Monster Machines, Paw Patrol and Shimmer and Shine are all strong consumer success stories with outstanding growth potential. Additionally, our recreation and hospitality efforts continue to come online. Finally, the SpongeBob musical has opened in Chicago to very positive critical buzz. We're looking forward to bringing it to New York next fiscal year.","This is the new Nickelodeon that Cyma Zarghami and her talented creative team have been building; and we couldn't be more excited or proud of the great turnaround they've engineered fueled by strategic insight, continued investment and unwavering faith in their capabilities. There is no kids' brand with more magic than Nickelodeon right now; and we believe that their broad portfolio of legitimate hits will drive significant diversified growth for years to come.","VH1 is also a great story and a blueprint of how investing in great content, acceleration of the development process and smart use of data can drive improved performance. VH1 expanded its ratings gain in Q3 finishing up 33%. That's right, 33%; the fourth consecutive quarter of growth.","VH1 is making aggressive investments in distinctive programming and drilling in on what VH1 fans want. Love & Hip Hop Atlanta continues to be a juggernaut and ranked as the number one reality show in cable. In fact, VH1 has two of the top five reality cable shows. Hip Hop Honors, which aired in July, was the highest rated VH1 tentpole in 15 years, with over three million viewers. We're building on these proven properties in the current quarter with Love & Hip Hop Hollywood and the new Amber Rose Show, which we took straight to air and are developing in real-time using sophisticated applications of audience science.","In addition, our marketing and scheduling teams at VH1 are applying proprietary learnings from Viacom's data insight capabilities to drive additional viewership and engagement, helping our hit shows gain even more audience traction. VH1 is leading the charge and we are exploring ways that these strategies can be applied seamlessly to our other adult networks.","Comedy Central's ratings improved significantly towards the end of the third quarter, and the network is up year-over-year in the fourth quarter so far. New leadership is reinvigorating the brand; and we are looking forward to a new season of Drunk History, the premier of a new stand-up series produced by and starring Kevin Hart, and the Comedy Central roast of Rob Lowe.","And, of course, Kyle, Cartman and the South Park gang are back for an historic 20th season premiering next month. Their anniversary celebration was the hit of Comic-Con. Their extraordinary longevity is a true testament to the creative excellence of Trey and Matt, the deep devotion of the show's fans, and the outstanding team at Comedy Central.","The BET Awards also continued its strong run, ranking as the number one cable awards show among audiences 18 to 49 for the 2015\/2016 broadcast season, claiming the top spot for the second consecutive year. Among African-American viewers, the program has ranked as television's number one awards show for the last 15 years.","Moving on to our international Media Networks, we continue to see a strong performance by Bob Bakish and his team with both advertising and affiliate revenues increasing at double-digit levels, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","Looking ahead, we remain intently focused on expanding and leveraging our diverse set of assets. We continue to diversify and strengthen our brand portfolio, reflecting demographic and market specific opportunities. Ten years ago when I became CEO, our international portfolio was singularly focused on youth. Today, our portfolio is radically different with more breadth and depth with a focus on the global six: Nick, Nick Jr., MTV, Comedy Central, the Paramount Channel and Spike. In fact, the Paramount Channel, the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world, is now in 93 million homes outside the U.S.","Our first major push beyond MTV was the Nickelodeon portfolio, which now reaches 283 million homes internationally. And we're now a major player in the adult demographic, which is significantly larger than our kids or youth segments. Comedy Central, our third global brand, is in 180 million homes outside the U.S. We now have 11 Paramount Channels, the largest ad-supported international film channel in the world, built from scratch in just four short years. And we've begun the rollout of Spike, which is doing very well for us in the three markets we've launched.","In just the past fiscal year alone, Viacom international Media Networks launched 15 new channels, with particular focus on the Middle East and Africa this past quarter. Of course, we also have two flagship local brands in the general entertainment space, Channel 5 in the UK and COLORS in India; and both are operating extremely well. Again, two significant and highly promising businesses that did not exist at Viacom 10 years ago.","In total, our channels now reach 3.8 billion aggregate subscribers, more than any other family of networks in the world; and looking ahead, there is very significant opportunity. The second priority is evolving from being simply an exporter of U.S. content to becoming a global content producer. We still bring a lot of high-performing domestic Viacom content to overseas markets, particularly on the kids' side, but we are also increasing production at Viacom international Media Networks for our networks around the world. In fact, there are seven in-house productions currently underway for Nickelodeon's global channels.","Third, and perhaps most exciting for its obvious significance to our entire portfolio, we are redefining what it means to be a TV network. Across our international footprint, pay TV penetration is approximately 40%, presenting us with attractive opportunities to exploit our digital products, including the Viacom Play Plex platform.","Viacom Play Plex provides TV everywhere functionality to cable customers, subscription services for mobile operators, as well as direct-to-consumer opportunities. We've got the infrastructure, the brands, the content and the products to quickly scale the way we get content to consumers across 180 countries.","Finally, Viacom international Media Networks is already generating significant revenues through consumer products; and we see a lot of potential recreation, particularly retail, hotels and live experiences. These opportunities exist throughout our portfolio, but we're putting particular focus on Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.","Now let's talk about Paramount. There is no question that studios had a rough go at the box office recently. But as they always do, we expect fortunes to turn. As you know, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows did not meet our expectations, but there are significant bright spots at the studio.","In particular, Paramount Television continues to grow rapidly, delivering new titles in the quarter including Berlin Station for EPIX. Paramount Television will be a continuing source of growth, augmenting the revitalization of Paramount's theatrical slate. Again, it is worth noting that Paramount's television production is a business that also did not exist a few years ago. We made it a priority to return Paramount to the television production business and we made it happen.","In the current quarter, we had the critically acclaimed Star Trek Beyond, which is still opening across territories around the world in the next several weeks. Later in the quarter, Paramount will open Florence Foster Jenkins with Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant and Ben Hur; and coming in the first quarter of 2017, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back starring Tom Cruise.","Regarding our exploration of the sale of a 49% interest in Paramount to a strategic buyer, as we previously disclosed, we have narrowed the process down to a handful of prospects. The process has slowed down in recent weeks, but we have reason to believe that favorable court developments last week will create a better environment that will allow us to progress with several parties toward a highly beneficial transaction to present to our board.","To conclude, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives and are confident that they will bear significant fruit as we prepare for our next fiscal year. The ratings at our domestic Media Networks are improving. Our successful upfront and continued leadership in data-driven products will allow us to take advantage of continued ratings improvements at key networks.","Our distribution landscape will improve as we lapped the fiscal 2016 consolidation impacts and SVOD comps and we continue to grow and monetize new platforms. Our international networks group will continue to expand in scope and value and Paramount will see better days ahead through improved film site performance, television production and we hope a groundbreaking strategic alliance.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.","Wade Davis","Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.","From a total company perspective, revenues grew 2% to $3.1 billion. Adjusted operating income was $769 million and adjusted net earnings were $419 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined to $1.05 in the quarter.","Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 7% and international revenues were up 13%. Excluding a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 18%, reflecting double-digit growth in advertising affiliate and ancillary revenues. Page nine of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.","In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 4% and international revenues were up 13%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 6 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 19%, driven by growth in Europe.","In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 8%. Domestic revenues declined 10% in the quarter, reflecting a difficult comparison with product made available under certain distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year. Excluding a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues increased 12%, driven by the completion of certain distribution agreements.","Expenses increased 11% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were up 12%, while distribution and other expenses decreased 8%. SG&A expense increased 13% in the quarter. The increase in programming costs was due to our continuing investment in original content. The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to higher advertising and promotional expense.","Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 22% for the quarter and the adjusted operating income margin was 34.7%. The decline in operating income was driven by the 3% decrease in revenues and the 11% increase in expenses.","Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were up 30% in the quarter principally due to increases in theatrical revenue and license fees. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.","Theatrical revenues increased to $91 million due to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows in the quarter. License fees increased 39%, principally driven by the licensing of certain titles and subscription video on-demand, as well as contributions from our television production business.","Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $26 million in the quarter as compared to income of $48 million last year. The loss in the quarter reflects the underperformance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 100 basis point increase as compared to the prior year.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Dooley","Thanks, Wade. I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt, as well as factors impacting our September quarter of fiscal 2016 that haven't already been discussed. For the quarter, we generated $90 million of free cash flow, which compares to $300 million of free cash flow in the June quarter of last year. Page five of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.","The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower operating income and higher working capital utilization, which was due to net investment in film product. This was partially offset by lower cash taxes.","In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. During the quarter, we repaid $368 million of our outstanding 6.25% senior notes that came due in April. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $192 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.6 times.","Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenue, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For fiscal year 2016, we expect domestic affiliate revenues to decline at low to mid-single digit rate. However, due to continuing uncertainty around the timing of completion of an SVOD distribution agreement, affiliate revenues could decline at mid to high-single digit rates.","For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the low to mid-single digits. And at Paramount, given the underperformance of certain films in the current year slate, we expect to generate an operating loss for the September quarter as well as for the full fiscal year. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, Philippe, to what extent is the public nature of the turmoil impacting the day-to-day running of the business and negotiations with partners?","Philippe Dauman","Well, obviously, it's somewhat of a distraction, but we're not deterred from pursuing the strategic initiatives that I described. Our brands are what drive our business. So to some extent, and probably the biggest impact has been on the ability to move forward rapidly on the Paramount transaction, which had initially been targeted to result in an agreement about a month ago. So that's certainly been slowed down. But as I indicated in my prepared remarks, they continue. And I hope that we will reach a conclusion on that that will be beneficial to the company in due course.","So that's really the principal impact apart from the general distraction naturally, but it does not deter us from pursuing our international growth; does not deter us from getting affiliate agreements concluded; does not deter us from producing great new programming; does not deter our management teams across our networks to be really focused on building our ratings; did not deter us in getting a successful upfront; did not deter us in developing continued industry-leading marketing products; did not deter us from finding new ways to distribute our content to our audiences everywhere they are on every device they utilize; and does not deter us from continually entering into new partnerships with companies like Roku, Snapchat and comScore and on and on.","So we're focused. We are driving value for this company, and we view any difficulties that we face as a challenge that we will overcome. We'll be creative in overcoming and really search for every opportunity.","I touched on some opportunities that will take a while to unfold, but they're pretty exciting. When you think about the power of the Nickelodeon brand, the fact that we have ratings success for so many new shows. People used to talk about our being so dependent on SpongeBob, but now we have such an array of shows and each of those shows has consumer products opportunity around the world, particularly as we have grown our Nickelodeon footprint. And speaking of SpongeBob, this musical is really great. Now, when it hits Broadway it could be an opportunity, not just inherently, but to revitalize that property. So the opportunities are many fold.","We have a strong management team. As you know, over the last year-and-a-half, we have reorganized significantly. We have new leadership at several of our networks. You're seeing the effects already that the new leadership is bringing. VH1 being the perfect example that I cited. So, yes, it's a distraction. But in the scope of time, it will be viewed as temporary, and our strategic initiatives continue unabated.","John Janedis","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe, Philippe, on the international front, advertising looks like it performed much better than peers. Can you just speak to what's driving the performance there? And is that trajectory expected to continue given the headlines coming out of Europe?","Philippe Dauman","Well, we have seen - the UK, we have great stronghold countries and we continue to build scale, both organically with our six global brands - and by the way we have many other brands that we're driving, whether it's BET or different Nick brands and so forth. So when I'm referring to six brands, I'm talking about the ones that are global in reach, every continent and continuing to grow across as many countries in those continents as possible. But when you have in the UK, we bought Channel 5; very attractive acquisition. We revitalized the brand. I mean, literally we changed the brand logo and we have invested in programming and we have a leading position there. It's gained share.","We've also looked to build scale in other countries and it's paying off. So we have really been building a platform last several years, which is really now coming to maturity. We still have a lot of opportunities to expand there. We're focused on building value. I've said it over and over again. And India, which is not a consolidated entity, continues to grow at extraordinary rates, will continue to grow at extraordinary rates year after year for years to come.","We continue to add network there. It's a country with a lot of opportunity; large population, fastest economic growth rate in the world today, the top growing economy in the world with a population that just loves entertainment. So our sector is growing much faster than GDP. So I believe I talked about it the last ten years and how it's grown to this point. I believe over the next 10 years, our international assets are going to have a value that potentially surpasses the entire value of the company today on the trajectory that we have.","James Bombassei","John, just on the future growth productions, obviously a lot of our activities in the segments are driven by the success in the UK marketplace. While we haven't seen a significant impact from Brexit, we do anticipate that something might have some slowdown in the future quarter. And as that manifests itself, it could bring us a little bit of a slowdown but we still think the growth is going to be very, very, very strong driven by ratings gains that we've had across our networks. And just to note, the India segment is not in the consolidated results, but below the line, but is a huge and fast growing business for us. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. Just curious, Philippe, do you remain confident in a return to mid-single digit domestic affiliate fee revenue growth in fiscal 2017 and if it's possible to disaggregate the June quarter results regarding domestic affiliate fee growth. What was core linear versus outside that'd be helpful as well? Thanks so much.","Philippe Dauman","Well, on the outside, I've addressed the fact that we did not complete an SVOD deal in the last quarter and we'll see what happens in this quarter; and really we're going to do the right deals in the right way as far as that goes. As to 2017, we had, as you know, significant impact of the distribution consolidation over the course of this fiscal year. We will be - once we get to the end of the calendar year, we will have lapped all of that. And so, with the average rate increases, we have good rate increase across our portfolio with no significant renewals coming up in 2017. So we've got a pretty good lock there.","We think there's the potential for stabilization of traditional distributors, subscriber count, given that there are some benefits in terms of maintaining distribution stickiness, which we've seen from the larger, more adept entities that have resulted. And the new distribution opportunities that we have are incremental, whether it's a Sling, a better penetration of platforms like Sony Vue and the many other opportunities that are there. So that's what leads us to optimism for next year's affiliate growth.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks a lot, Philippe. And just a clarification, on the June quarter, I understand the lack of SVOD. I'm curious was there any change from the calendar first quarter to calendar second quarter in terms of flow around cord-cutting or skinny bundle impacts the traditional linear revenue stream for distribution?","Wade Davis","Relatively consistent quarter to quarter. The big biggest issue, 90% of the decline was due to the SVOD discrepancy on a year-over-year basis.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much.","Philippe Dauman","And one thing I'd like to point out I pointed out publicly before, because I've noted some of our competitors talking about how much such a number of networks represents of their affiliate revenue, just to bring up a so-called skinny bundle. I just want to point out that our top six networks account for close to 85% of our affiliate revenue. Our top eight networks account for close to 95% of our affiliate revenue. So some have erroneously suggested that somehow whatever falls in that little segment of the market, the skinny bundles, somehow are disadvantaged compared to others, we are not. I just want to point that out I've pointed it out before.","Doug Mitchelson","All right. Thank you.","James Bombassei","We'll take our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. I have two for Tom or Philippe. Can you just talk about - you've spent time talking about the SVOD deal that didn't get done in the quarter. What's holding that up? Is that a board factor or is that based on the terms of what you think the agreement will be? So what's the gaining factor for slowing down the SVOD deals?","Philippe Dauman","Well, again, I don't want to get into a specific situation, it's obviously not helpful to discussions we may be having. But in any deal, we always look for the right terms. As you know, there are many players out there, many players. Some of the big so-called traditional distributors which are looking at non-traditional products, virtual MVPD products, we have new distributors such as Hulu looking at creating virtual MVPD product. We have to look carefully at the interrelationship of those kinds of discussions with the licensing of shows on SVOD. And, of course, we focus on non-current and season product, library product, in that regard.","So we just want to be thoughtful about how we conclude it and make sure that we maximize our overall value. And, again, we will, and we're not going to be beholden to timing of a particular quarter to reach a correct long-term decision. But we are having fruitful discussions. We are pursuing those discussions. And they may very well be done in this quarter, and I hope they will on attractive terms for Viacom.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And let me just ask Tom. You said your current leverage is 3.6 times. As you know, S&P downgraded its outlook to negative. You still have your BBB-. If you're blocked from selling Paramount, what will be the impact on your cost of capital and your ability to use short-term borrowings to fund working capital?","Thomas Dooley","I think we have plenty of balance sheet room and don't anticipate there's any significant downside risk there in terms of our capital availability. Have $2.5 billion available under our bank line, access to the commercial paper marketplace. So we feel very comfortable with the company's overall liquidity position. We've been easily able to pay off our debt out of both our free cash flows and our continued availability in the credit marketplace. So I don't see any issue there whatsoever with Paramount. The movie business, it comes and it goes. And we fully expect Paramount to get back on track next year and provide some very positive comps.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thank you.","James Bombassei","We'll take our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you. Can you provide any color on sort of domestic advertising outlook for the September quarter? I guess given the better ratings on some of your networks, can we see improvements from the decline we saw in the quarter or are make goods and a reduction ad load still a very big headwind in the quarter?","Thomas Dooley","I think on the quarter that we're in, because of the Olympics, I think we'll have a little bit of worse performance than we had in this quarter. But as we look forward beyond that, we start to see the favorable trend in advertising sales that we saw in this quarter continue. And the upfront that we entered into was both significant and very successful for us and our products. By products, I mean, the traditional advertising that we sell, and all the data advantage product that we sell and all the integrated advertising product that we sell. Our ad sales organization performed extraordinarily well in bringing our product to market. So we look forward to 2017 as a very important and meaningful year to get advertising sales back on track at Viacom.","Philippe Dauman","And also, this is where we will have our Viacom Vantage product, a mix of new currencies really, really kicking in. So, again, it's another example just getting through this fiscal year and getting to a stronger position, benefiting from the strategic initiatives that we have been undergoing over the last few years. And so, we're going to start seeing the culmination of all those initiatives in a number of areas, and this being, of course, a very important one on the revenue side.","Alexia Quadrani","And just a follow-up on some of the networks. You've really done a great job in turning around some of the ratings in some of your core networks, but MTV is still really struggling. I guess anything that we can look to from the outside there that would suggest some sort of positive turn in the outlook?","Philippe Dauman","Yeah. So MTV, we have completely revamped the senior leadership of MTV over the last several months. The team is complete. They've been working on bringing the volume and quality of development to what it was not too long ago. We really had a fallow period there. So we've remedied that. And we're going to start seeing the output from that development from the new team - in this quarter we're going to start seeing it, and then building up again as we go into the new year. That will be very meaningful for us.","And as we've seen in some of the other networks, as you describe, whether it's VH1 or Nickelodeon, obviously you need the quality and we have a highly motivated, energized new management team to do it coming from many different other companies in our industry. But you need to have shown and you need to have to be able to fill your schedule. So with that, we have reason to be optimistic that we can improve from what has been a tough period. We're just putting in place - we put in place in other networks. So that, given that MTV is one of our bigger networks, could have a significant impact for us.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","James Bombassei","We have time for one more question.","Operator","And our final question comes from Vasily Karasyov with CLSA.","Vasily Karasyov","Thank you very much. Philippe, you spoke about Vantage contributing to advertising revenue recovery, hopefully, in fiscal 2017. Can you explain, please, in layman's terms your data-driven advertising initiatives on Vantage? Where are the budgets coming from? Do you get better CPM or is it better yield? Or just is it the advertiser retention program or are you attracting incremental dollars actually through that?","Thomas Dooley","Vasily, this is Tom. I'll take that question. I mean, Vantage product and all of our data-suite product uses - are the data that we have often in conjunction with data that our own advertisers have around their product to further target and identify a more specific audience segment that is something much more conducive to their advertising or marketing campaign goals. That is combined with our data to provide a more sophisticated and specific audience, which oftentimes is coming out of, to your point, a different advertiser pool budget. It's often measured sometimes with Nielsen data, sometimes in conjunction with Nielsen data and other data metrics and sometimes with data metrics that are stand-alone unto itself.","These are great new products where as a marketplace we're at the very beginning of having advertisers really begin to evolve their thinking on how they want to target certain audiences. Data and the Vantage product and all the data products Viacom teams are bringing to the marketplace begin to work with advertisers on a very bespoke basis to identify unique and individual audiences.","And then, once we identify the audiences and campaigns to reach them, we then work on the economics of the campaign. But, as you know, this has become a very significant part of our incremental revenue in the advertising business and I think into the future of the business; and we're well paced and far ahead of many of our competitors in that regard.","Vasily Karasyov","And how would you compare unit pricing for data-driven advertising versus traditional?","Thomas Dooley","Much higher unit pricing because the audience delivered is a much more specific and highly desired audience by the advertiser. It's what they would've otherwise tried to purchase and pay a lot more for a lot of people that don't fit the criteria in the broad blunt instruments that the current advertiser marketplace uses for audience reach definition.","Vasily Karasyov","Thank you.","James Bombassei","We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.","Operator","And that concludes today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
