My name is Tom, and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call to discuss our second quarter results. On the call today is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President, Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, President of AirTran Airways; and Ron Ricks, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer.","We will begin with opening remarks from Gary, followed by Tammy providing overview of our results and current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy's remarks.","Please be advised, today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","And Gary, now we'll turn it over to you for opening remarks.","Gary C. Kelly","Thank you very much, Marcy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2014 earnings. We're very pleased with the second quarter performance. I'd like to point out a list of things before Tammy takes us through the financial results.","First of all, I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, for successfully transforming Southwest Airlines, for these stellar earnings results and then for the historic year of 2014 that they are managing.","Second, the quarterly results include significant planned benefits from our all-new Rapid Rewards program, the AirTran acquisition and our fleet modernization. We would not have these results without these initiatives.","Third, the network optimization over the last 5 years has paid off handsomely, supported, of course, by our strategic initiative, but we have significant market strength across our route network. It is very impressive. It's very encouraging. And while we have a very large percentage of the network under development, almost 20%, unlike a year ago, it's not a significant drag on our performance. And we've got reason to believe that this segment will mature rapidly.","Fourth, the cost control efforts, which is essentially our fleet modernization initiative, is working very well, producing fuel efficiency, as well as nonfuel efficiencies.","Fifth, we have a number of large nonroutine programs and projects that are being managed. Several become final this year, International, the repeal of the Wright Amendment and the completion of the AirTran integration. Let me just go through each of those very quickly.","First, we've finished and launched international right on schedule. That is a very key milestone for wrapping up the AirTran integration. There are probably thousands of people to thank for what has been a flawless effort to get international up and running for Southwest Airlines. And I am very grateful to them all, but in particular, our technology department and their leadership on this project.","The repeal of the Wright Amendment is now 88 days away. The schedule's out for sale. It is a superb schedule. The airport construction is close to completion. The airport is also working superb, and our marketing and advertising is in full swing and it is superb. We've got more surprises planned for the fall. It will be a joyous celebration after 35 years of restrictions at Dallas Love Field.","And then finally, we are right on track to move airplanes and people out of AirTran and into Southwest by year end, to convert the remaining airports and routes from AirTran to Southwest by year end and then retire the AirTran brand and the few remaining Boeing 717s that we'll have by year end. And of course, that's a lot of work that I just ticked through, and our people are doing a superb job of managing all of that.","Sixth, we are continuing to generate very strong cash flow, allowing us to reduce debt, reduce outstanding shares, return value to shareholders with LUV at a lifetime high. We've got a $1 billion-plus share repurchase authorization to continue returning value to our shareholders, along with our quarterly dividend. And that was just increased by 50% by our board in our main meeting.","And then finally, our third quarter earnings outlook is strong. That, of course, is at this point in time. We'll continue to closely monitor our results and our outlook, the economy and fuel prices as we now contemplate reasoned and measured available seat mile growth beginning in 2015.","And our immediate priority with growth is, of course, Dallas Love Field, number one; and then secondly, Washington Reagan. That is as we begin to operate and fly the slots that we acquired from American earlier this year for Washington Reagan.","And our focus will be reliable, excellent operations, outstanding customer service and consistent, strong profits, which means a return on invested capital of at least 15%. And as planned, we've got tremendous growth opportunities that have been enabled beyond 2014. And that really is a remarkable change since just 2010. And all of that is a wonderful thing.","But those opportunities will have to be prioritized, and they'll have to be pursued in a manner that allows us to achieve our annual goals. And again to repeat those, it is excellent, reliable operations; it is outstanding customer service and consistent profits at our target -- targeted ROIC of at least 15%.","So Tammy, with that overview, I'd like to turn it over to you. And congratulations, Ms. Romo, on a wonderful quarter","Tammy Romo","Well, thank you, Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we reported, our second quarter 2014 net income, excluding special items, was $495 million or $0.70 per diluted share, which represents our fifth consecutive quarter of record profitability. These are very strong results, and we are seeing significant benefits from our strategic initiative.","Our profits were up 77%, with EPS up 84%, which is a significant year-over-year improvement. And that was driven by strong revenues, lower fuel prices and our ongoing cost control efforts. Our second quarter GAAP net income was also a record $465 million.","Our operating income, excluding special items, also set a second quarter record and produced a stellar 16.3% operating margin. And of course, I'm delighted to say our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items, for the 12 months ended June 30 was 17.1%, which, on an after-tax basis was 10.7%, well exceeding our weighted average cost of capital. This is a tremendous accomplishment that required much work and focus by all of our people, and I congratulate and thank all of our outstanding employees for the strong financial results released this morning.","Our second quarter revenue performance was very strong, and we broke many records. Operating revenues increased to a record $5 billion, driven by record passenger revenues of $4.8 billion, which increased 8.5% year-over-year on relatively flat ASM.","Strong demand for travel, both business and leisure, resulted in record traffic, passenger yields and load factors. And as Gary already said, our strategic initiatives also significantly contributed to our record second quarter revenues.","I also want to mention that our second quarter passenger revenues included $47 million related to a change to previously recorded estimates of tickets expected to spoil in the future. But with or without this additional revenue, passenger unit revenues were very, very strong. And as we reported, PRASM grew 9% year-over-year, and that was supported by unit revenue strength across all regions and lengths of haul.","This was an outstanding performance, especially considering roughly 2-point year-over-year unit revenue headwind from increased seat gauge and stage length, which, of course, had an even greater unit cost benefit. As Gary already mentioned, we had close to 20% of our second quarter ASMs under development, which is significantly higher than historical norms.","And our international and other developing markets, resulting in large part from the AirTran integration, are ramping up nicely and are performing in line with our expectations. Strong revenue trends have continued, [indiscernible] per quarter. And based on current bookings and revenue trends, we expect July's PRASM to be up year-over-year, roughly 3% over last July's strong performance. And bookings for August and September are also good.","So our revenue outlook for third quarter is quite good. But keep in mind, third quarter year-over-year comparisons will be more challenging due to the strong prior year trends.","Moving to freight and other revenues. Freight revenues grew 2.3% year-over-year as we continue to expand cargo service with the integration of our AirTran network. And we currently expect third quarter freight revenue to be comparable to second quarter. And although we had solid gains in our ancillary products, other revenues declined year-over-year as expected due to this decrease in fees, of course, as we wind down the AirTran line. And other ancillary revenues were also $58 million.","We currently expect other revenues in third quarter to also decline year-over-year, likely at a greater year-over-year rate than we experienced in second quarter. And that's simply due to the ongoing conversion of the AirTran network.","Turning to costs. We had a solid performance with operating costs comparable to second quarter last year. And on a unit basis, costs, excluding special items, increased only 1.2%. In addition to the cost reductions from our strategic initiatives, we also benefited from lower fuel costs.","Our second quarter economic fuel price per gallon was $3.02 per gallon, which reflected a $0.05 hedging gain. And our fleet modernization and other fuel conservation initiatives improved fuel burn by 1.4% year-over-year, which reduced our second quarter fuel costs by approximately $20 million.","Our third quarter fuel hedge consists of 10%. It's 10% hedged at varying crude oil prices and about 25% in Gulf Coast jet varying prices. Based on market prices as of July 21 and our current hedge position, our third quarter 2014 economic fuel price is forecast to be in the $2.95 to $3 range. And our hedging premiums are estimated to be about $15 million in the third quarter.","Excluding special items and fuel and oil expense, our unit costs were up 3.4%. A significant portion of this increase was driven by a record profit sharing of $127 million. And when you exclude profit sharing, our unit costs increased just 1.7% year-over-year. And this was slightly better than our 2% to 3% guidance on unit costs, primarily due to the shift of certain costs such as advertising and training to the second half of the year.","Based on current cost trends, we expect third quarter unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase year-over-year, similar to what we saw in the second quarter, which was a 1.7% year-over-year increase.","Turning to our very healthy balance sheet and cash flow. We ended second quarter 2014 with $4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which included $105 million in collateral held from third parties. Our free cash flow during the second quarter was a strong $838 million. And year-to-date, we have generated approximately $1.6 billion.","As a result of our strong free cash flow generation, we've returned $652 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of $555 million in stock and the distribution of $97 million in dividends for the first half of this year. And since August 2011, our buyback authorization at that time and including our quarterly dividend payments, we returned a meaningful $1.9 billion to our shareholders.","In the second quarter, we repurchased $240 million in shares and distributed $42 million in dividend payments including our June payment, which represented our 151st consecutive quarterly dividend paid to shareholders in our history.","We have $780 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which was announced in May, along with a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend. And since the acquisition of AirTran, we've also reduced our debt and capital lease obligations net by a significant $1.5 billion and intend to repay an additional $440 million, and scheduled that in capital lease payments for the second half of this year. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, was 37% as of the end of June.","Our 2014 capital spending forecast remains at approximately $1.8 billion, with $1 billion to $1.1 billion of that related to firm aircraft spend.","And that brings me to the fleet, and I'll refer you to our press release for our second quarter activity. But here's a quick recap of our full year 2014 fleet plans. We have 33 firm orders for 737-800 from Boeing and plan to add at least 17 preowned 737-700. We've removed 41 of the AirTran 717s from service. The remaining 47 will be removed from service by the end of this year.","As of the end of the second quarter, we've transitioned 36 717s to Delta and currently plan to transition 16 more this year. In addition, thus far, we've transitioned 24 of the 52 AirTran -700s to Southwest, which will leave 28 -700 aircraft remaining that we plan to transition before the end of this year.","Our fleet plans still includes managing to a relatively flat fleet through the end of 2015 with a baseline of roughly 695 aircraft, which, again, was our combined fleet at the time of the AirTran acquisition. We expect our third quarter 2014 ASMs to increase year-over-year approximately 2% and full year 2014 ASMs to be up under 1% year-over-year.","And again for 2015, we expect our available seat miles to increase year-over-year, and that's driven by the 2% to 3% increase expected in seats from the updating of our fleet, along with the higher utilization of our fleet post-integration. 2015 ASMs are also expected to grow from a longer stage length on the new flights at Love Field, DCA, LaGuardia and new international flying from Houston.","As we manage the integration work and removal of the 717s and as previously guided, we plan to augment the firm orders and free [ph] on aircraft beyond what we have disclosed in our press release. So really, no new news there.","To close, we are delighted with our second quarter earnings performance, which exceeded our expectations. Our Southwest warriors have worked very hard to execute our strategic initiatives and restore our financial performance. And it's very gratifying to see how well it's all coming together here in 2014.","The benefits relating to the AirTran integration, our fleet modernization efforts, the -800s, and our new Rapid Rewards program are all meeting or exceeding expectations. And the full replacement of our reservation system is off to a great start.","July 1 was a day of great pride here at Southwest as we successfully launched international service to Aruba, Montego Bay in Jamaica with our new international reservation system. And the network opportunities that we have ahead are very exciting, and we will continue to focus on achieving and sustaining adequate returns on capital.","Our cash flow and balance sheet remain strong, and we will continue our diligent efforts to provide adequate returns to our valued shareholders. And although we still have a few months to go before we can claim victory for full year 2014, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed our 15% target, with the exceptional results produced during the first half of the year.","And with that overview, Tom, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Tammy, back to the -- on the aircraft. I think you said that you were going to be bringing on what, 17 used 737s. Are those -700s or -800s? Is that a mix?","Tammy Romo","It's -700s.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And is that all this year or into next year?","Tammy Romo","Yes, the 17 that I gave is all this year.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the -- when you talked about next year, I just -- to clarify, the seat count is up 2% to 3%, but then you threw in a point about longer stage length. So I guess, is it -- if we think about it on an ASM basis, it's going to be slightly higher than 2% to 3%? Is that how we should think of it?","Tammy Romo","Yes. Mike, we haven't provided our full year ASM outlook. However, we will be publishing our first quarter 2015 schedule in the coming weeks, and that will reflect about a 5% ASM growth year-over-year. And Mike, I know you'll remember this. We had 1.5 points of this growth is -- we're expecting that to be due to, as you recall, first quarter last year, we had -- we were impacted by the -- or actually, first quarter this year, we were impacted by the winter storms. And of course, as you would expect with the sunset of the Wright Amendment, we'll have -- likely have a longer flying out of Love Field and also DCA and likely LaGuardia. So I think that accounts for the difference between the -- kind of the 2% to 3% increase in seats versus the 5% ASM growth that we're expecting in our first -- in our schedule, which will take us through about March.","Gary C. Kelly","So again, Mike, that -- the 5% that Tammy's talking about is the estimate for the first quarter.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, very good. No, that's helpful. And then my second question and this is either for Tammy, you or even Gary. When you look at your sort of -- the booking window for customers, business and leisure, historically, you've been a lot shorter than the rest of the industry. I think the rest of the industry, I think it's 330 days, plus or minus a few. You've historically been, I don't know, 180, maybe you've topped it to that 200, 210. As you move into the newer systems, you move on to the Amadeus Alt\u00e9a system and as you start flying international where people tend to book those, especially on the leisure front, some of those tickets are booked much further in advance. A trip to Jamaica or even down the road if you decide to fly to Hawaii, those are bigger decisions, and they tend to have longer lead times. Do we start to see your booking period extend? Is that in the offing? Would that be part of moving on to this new Amadeus system? Your thoughts on that.","Gary C. Kelly","I think there's 2 -- really 2 aspects to answering your question. One is just customer behavior. And you're right, even if we don't change our 180-day -- and your rule of thumb there is right, it's about 6 months out. Even if we don't change that, I suspect that we'll start seeing more bookings out farther on our booking curve. Secondly, with the new reservation system that we're working on, that won't be in place for 2015. And we haven't given a timeline for that yet, Tammy, I don't think.","Tammy Romo","We have not.","Gary C. Kelly","So really, we'll be -- we don't want to change our current reservation system capabilities, it's not worth it. So it will be a year or more before we'll have the capabilities to realistically extend the bookings. I think there's more to it than just adding the reservation system capability. That's a long time to put a schedule out. And as you know, the rest of the industry goes in and makes changes to it. And we typically have not done that. So that would be somewhat of a policy\/procedure change that we would need to think through as well. So we agree with everything you said, that as we go longer and go more international, that there will probably be more demand for bookings further out. And that's something that we'll have the capabilities in the future to choose to do or not. But at this point, I don't think we've made a firm commitment one way or the other.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","How much of your cost advantage do you attribute to having a single fleet type now that you've acquired and in the process of divesting 717s?","Tammy Romo","Hunter, this is -- we know that we have a significant advantage just from a single fleet type. And I guess from the 717s, really the benefit of transitioning from 717s to -- back to a 737 fleet is pretty significant. Now of course, a lot of that is just driven by just the more fuel-efficient 737 fleet. So probably the best gauge I can give you, if your question is on really the 717s versus the 737, are really just the benefits that we provided in our fleet modernization efforts, which is the EBIT. We're expecting that to be in $500 million range here for this year. But clearly, we have the -- we have a clear advantage relative to the rest of the industry. And certainly, a single fleet type is a large -- is a contributor to that. And our advantage is, I think, Hunter, relative to the legacy carriers, our cost advantage is probably 30% to 35%. So I don't have a specific figure to give you here off the top of my head but certainly, it is a -- it's a notable contributor to our low-cost advantage.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, Tammy. And as you think about the -- obviously, a longer stage length next year, and [indiscernible] to give ASM guidance on known seat count guidance and as we think about the increased popularity of the Rapid Rewards program, are you getting pressure from some of your better customers to improve the number of redemption markets and -- one of those being Hawaii? And I know you guys talked about expanding into Hawaii, your analysts, think it was a couple of years ago almost at this point. But how has that thought process evolved? And are the -800s coming ETOPS certified that will enable that to take place next year?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I'm not sure until we follow on your question. So with the Southwest route network, we don't have any restrictions anywhere. And there are -- every seat, every flight, every -- obviously, every destination has access online. And then you've got the opportunity to buy seats offline with our Rapid Rewards program. I think our programs are fantastic. It's the -- by all measures, it is better than the other program. We've got record levels of membership and all the things that I know you know. So in terms of people being dissatisfied with how they can you use their rewards on the Southwest system, no, we don't get that at all. If we ever do choose to serve Hawaii, I'm sure they'll be delighted to have that. But in the meantime, they've got some wonderful Southwest destinations, which, Hunter, one way or the other, they're going to continue to get more attractive as we expand beyond the 48 states. Mike Van De Ven does have some of the -800s equipped with ETOPS. We have work to do to fly to Hawaii, which I doubt we'll be able to keep a secret. So you'll know when we've made that commitment when we decide that. And it will take us not years from start to finish, but it'll take us some time to actually activate that. Hawaii is 1 of 50 potential destinations that we now have created. And it'll just have to compete priority-wise with the other great opportunities that we have. So I've realize your question wasn't specifically about Hawaii. The only thing that I noticed, Tammy, looking at the utilization of the awards, which was interesting to me is that the growth we've seen in the award usage over the past 5-plus years is actually taking place more in short-haul markets. And in the old days, our program was oriented towards rewarding people for flying short, and then they would use the award to fly long. So interestingly enough, the growth in utilization is actually more in the short-haul markets. But I don't think we've got any complaints whatsoever at this point with our new program. It's working very well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, I just wanted to follow-up on the last thing that you just said, 50 potential destinations out there that you've created. Can you just kind of walk us through the process here for how you're thinking about growth going forward? We've heard other low-cost carriers sort of talk about the rising price umbrella, creating a lot of new growth opportunities. I'm just curious sort of big picture how you arrive at that number and certainly sounds like you're now prospecting for new markets.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, we've been working on this, John, for years so there's no surprise with where we are. I think it is simply counting dots that have simply been created by adding the 737-800 and international capabilities, also propelled by the AirTran acquisition that makes these potential destinations available to us. They were not available to us in 2010 was the main point I was trying to illustrate. We won't go add 50 dots to the route map next year. The 50, as I'm describing it to you, they are all beyond the 48 states. So there's nothing new. It's Hawaii, Alaska, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and the northern part of South America. Those are all within the performance capabilities of the 737. And they all at least look sufficiently attractive when it comes to the traffic potential and filling up the 737. So it's a wonderful place to be, and whether we'll ultimately serve all 50 destinations is not guaranteed or committed to. It's just the fact that those are opportunities, there's a number of them and we'll have to prioritize according to, fundamentally, what's the next best opportunity for traffic and revenue and profits. It'll be a little complicated by the fact that in some cases, we'll need to add capabilities to the aircraft like ETOPS. So that has to be factored in. Or in the case of Mexico, in particular, you have to apply for route authorities, and then we'll have to do that on a strategic and the tactical basis as well. But it's a nice -- as I said in my remarks, it's a wonderful thing, and it's just nice to be able to have a number of opportunities to choose from.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. I had understood it's 50 in general, but it sounds like you're specifically talking about international opportunities because of the changing capability.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, and it -- that's just the way our domestic route map has developed. After the AirTran acquisition, we added 17 more domestic destinations to the Southwest route map. And as you look at the route map, we cover the top 50 with one exception. So the -- we know and you know that our opportunities to add dots or destinations in the 48 states is rather limited. So absolutely, the opportunities to grow in terms of destinations is beyond the 48 states. Now let me quickly clarify that there are numerous opportunities to grow within the 48 states among the destinations that we currently serve, connecting dots, additional frequencies, Wright Amendment and -- or, well, rather Dallas Love Field and Washington Reagan being 2 prominent and easy examples there. But additional thoughts will be beyond the 48 states most likely.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And that's a good segue to my second question, which is I understand sort of the difficulty in talking about ASM growth rates overall when you have so many different moving parts in international growth and so on and so forth. But domestically, over the next few years, what's the right framework for thinking about capacity growth or your willingness to add capacity growth?","Gary C. Kelly","I think it's to be determined. I think that we have a real high class problem, which is we have far more places that we would like to serve than we'll have airplanes and we'll make those judgments tactically based on, again, the inputs that I've described to you. But we'll -- one would assume that if we have mature markets that have growth opportunities that, that would probably compete for a top priority spot. But again, there's no reason for us to make that commitment at this point. And we'll just have to manage this in a very measured way year-to-year and with the annual objectives in mind of running a great operation, offering outstanding customer service and hitting our return on invested capital target. And those are going to be the guidepost in determining how we grow and how fast we grow.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And do you think about that ROIC target for growth differently for international versus domestic, given just different risks?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think, yes. I mean, in other words, every opportunity is going to have to meet the 15% threshold, and if the risks are higher, well then, they'll have to be factored in.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Just on the 717 transition, so what will salaries and training costs look like after this year? And maybe percent change or what percent is from this year's related to the training and so on to move those pilots from the 717s to the 737s?","Tammy Romo","Helane, yes, after -- I think it's really after this year. I think we may have some training costs that dribble into next year, but it shouldn't be all that significant. And in terms of just the step-up in the wage rate as we bring our AirTran employees, convert them over to Southwest employees, really all that's remaining there are the, of course, the crews. And -- but that's all been factored into the guidance that we've given you. So really all the employees are already Southwest employees, with the exception of the pilots and flight attendants that we need over on the AirTran side until we bring that flying over to Southwest.","Gary C. Kelly","Helane, I probably won't add anything to what Tammy has already said, but just for a little color, and this is a huge shout out to all of our folks in our training departments, flight operations, and then all of the rest of our operating groups, they're doing a phenomenal job. We have record training events occurring in 2014. So in other words, in the first half costs that you already have seen, we have an unusually large amount of training underway. And that will continue through the balance of this year. And I agree with Tammy, by the time you get into 2015, we'll be back more to normal, although I think, Mike [ph], there's probably some front end, maybe 2 months of 2015, where we'll have heavy training events. But the other point to make here is that you have a lot of aircraft and a lot of employees \"out of service\" in 2014 and we're still producing strong results. Well, those airplanes effectively come back into service next year as they get through the conversion. And then our employees, as they get through all the big gulp training that's taking place in 2014, they'll be more productive next year as well. You'll have more -- you'll have a higher percentage of employees at the Southwest pay scale next year, so that will create some inflation. And I'll just refer to Tammy on that.","Tammy Romo","Yes. Helane, only other point I just wanted to make on the training, if you're working on your model there, just as a reminder, those training costs are included in the integration costs. And as we said in the earnings release, we're expecting that total cost to be about $550 million. Training is just one component of that, of course. So that's where the training costs, at least, are showing up.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the 8% kind of numbers we're looking at in salaries is kind of a true number and doesn't have any of those events in it?","Tammy Romo","That is correct. It does include -- as we're converting the AirTran employees over to Southwest, it includes that step up, but it does not include the training costs. Those are included in the integration costs.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just my follow-up question on an unrelated item. I think you said you opened the schedule and are now starting to take bookings for the Wright Amendment sign, yes, with 88 days to go. Early days here I know, but is there -- can you give us some color on how that's booking and what you're seeing in terms of, I don't know, picking up passengers that may be going on -- that may have been avoiding you, not going on a one-stop basis over some of your other cities?","Gary C. Kelly","They look really -- they look very normal, they look very solid. And that's just within the context that the outlook looks real strong. So it all looks good. I think Tammy mentioned in her comments just the second quarter performance of the \"Wright Amendment markets,\" and we saw a very strong increase already, and I suppose a lot of it's just the awareness that's been created about the restrictions coming down and the publishing of the new schedule. But yes, I think we had a 21% increase in the Wright Amendment revenue oriented around Dallas, obviously, in the second quarter. So -- but yes, those markets all look good. There's 15 new nonstop destinations that we'll launch in -- October 13th to early November and we can't wait.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just continuing on Helane's question there, but specific to fleet. As you think about lower utilization, transitioning aircraft to Delta and from AirTran to Southwest, can you quantify what the headwind to CASM is this year as it relates to fleet transition and lower utilization?","Tammy Romo","Duane, I'm just thinking here with you. We would be impacted some on the utilization. I don't know that I can pinpoint a specific number for you as we move forward. But we should see, as we get all of the flying over to Southwest, obviously, an improvement in the utilization, which is also driving some of the ASM improvement or the ASM increase that I mentioned for the first quarter. I'm just trying to think through and reconcile with you what that number might be, but...","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","It just feels like it's a -- it's probably a material component of your CASM growth...","Tammy Romo","Yes, I think to your point...","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","May not recur, right?","Tammy Romo","Yes. And to your point, we definitely have opportunities, as we look ahead to 2015, to be more efficient with our fleet. And as you can imagine, with the conversion of all the markets in 2014, just from a staffing perspective as well, we're not -- we're clearly not as efficient as we could be going forward as well once we have just more stability in our network. So we haven't given unit cost guidance for next year, but as you can see this year, we're certainly benefiting from the increased gauge, and I would expect in 2015 that we would also get some benefit from just the overall improvement in utilization. But we're still working through our plan and our schedule and all the details for next year. And it will give you a better guidance on that as we get a little bit later in the year and have a little more certainty on our schedule for 2015.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one for Gary. I mean, when you hit this target, which we've been pointing to for years and you finally realize it this year, what do you do? Do you raise it? I mean, what happens when you hit a sort of long-standing aspirational target?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think Duane, we do what I said we're going to do, which is we're going to take up every year and have a goal to run an excellent, reliable operation, provide outstanding customer service and have a business and a plan that continues to have consistent profitability, achieving at least a 15% pretax return on invested capital. We've got opportunities to grow the network both domestically and internationally, as we've described. And we'll want to manage that growth very, very carefully so that we sustain all 3 of those performance levels. But we want our return on invested capital to continue to be at least 15%, with 15% as the floor.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joe DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Tammy, maybe going back to the Rapid Rewards program kind of in the context of how successful you view that being for you guys, can you just talk a little bit about the growth in the frequent flier liability there? And it's growing at a rate a little bit faster than your peers. I mean, is the plan to manage that a little bit more aggressively in the future? Or are you okay with the growth you're seeing?","Tammy Romo","Well, we -- we're constantly evaluating the -- our Rapid Rewards program. And just as a reminder, we did recently increase the coefficient for using a Rapid Rewards flight. And so that's at least keeping the usage in line with what we -- with what our more recent trends have been. But as Gary stated earlier, we've been extremely happy with the Rapid Rewards program. And the -- let's see, the benefits -- the second quarter impact related to our Rapid Rewards program is probably roughly $95 million on a year-over-year basis, $95 million. So we're seeing probably a 40% to 50% increase in our revenue year-over-year. So we're delighted with how that's performing. But to your point, we've obviously got to keep an eye on the liability where we're monitoring the usage. But the overall economics, we're very happy with.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Quick clarification. The cost guidance doesn't contain any accruals, correct, Tammy?","Tammy Romo","That is correct.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And more broadly speaking, and I'm not asking you to negotiate in public here. I'm just curious if there's been any change in the tone of negotiations in light of your very impressive recent results.","Gary C. Kelly","Negotiations continue. We've got negotiations with a number of workgroups. And the pace and understandably, the texture of those negotiations is different by workgroup. So it obviously puts the company in a position where it can afford to do certain things. But the main thing that we need to do is to preserve Southwest Airlines' low fare brand and low-cost position competitively. And it doesn't change the need to do that. Our competition is stronger today than it has been in a long time. And so we'll -- that hasn't changed, Jamie, and therefore, it's a great rallying cry for all of our people to work together to beat all of our competitors, so that's -- that work continues.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. Okay, I appreciate that. And secondly, I know you don't guide on fuel efficiency, but with the amplification 717s going out, 73 is coming in, longer stage lengths, I personally could use an assist. I mean for 2015, would you expect ASMs per gallon to exceed 74? Or is something in the 73 range more likely?","Gary C. Kelly","We've got -- and I'll let Tammy think about that while I just make one quick comment here. And we -- and Jamie, I think we can do that. Now we have tried to -- or at least our Investor Relations effort here has tried to give you some guidance with the fleet modernization benefits, which I think, Tammy, are largely fuel efficiency.","Tammy Romo","That's correct.","Gary C. Kelly","So you do have that. But you're right. It hasn't equated precisely to the consumption number. So -- but yes, we're already realizing significant benefits from the fleet modernization\/fuel efficiency. Of course, the fleet modernization with an upgauging benefit, as an example, has -- as you well know, has benefits beyond just fuel burn. But anyway, let me -- do you have a...","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And I would definitely agree with that conclusion. I mean, you've punched nicely north of 72 as of the fourth quarter of last year.","Tammy Romo","I think directionally, you're in the ballpark, Jamie. I had sort of a 73 in mind. But I think we'll continue to see improvement as we go for all the obvious reasons as we continue to replace the 717s and the classic aircraft with more fuel-efficient airplanes. But we haven't given a number yet for the next year, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it exceed 74.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I know your credit rating is very important to you, and obviously having a strong balance sheet makes a lot of sense. I'm just wondering whether you think your balance sheet is bordering too conservative at this stage with cash and short-term investments hovering north of about 200% of consensus revenue estimates for the year.","Tammy Romo","Well, obviously, maintaining a healthy balance sheet obviously has always been a top priority for Southwest. And we really do have a lot -- which really -- it's really a balancing act and we have a lot of guideposts. Of course, one of our goals for this year that we stated is to -- we have an investment grade balance sheet. We would like to notch that up, and so that's obviously one consideration. But as Gary said earlier, we have a lot of high-class problems. Our questions on our hands is -- so really, our overall goal is to enhance shareholder value. I think we'll need to balance our capital expenditures against our desire to continue to enhance capital through our shareholder deployment. So I think -- and I think the other guidepost I would just point you to is just our cash balance, it is $4 billion. Our target is probably closer to $2.5 billion. But keep in mind too, there's some seasonality in that cash balance. And we do have -- as I mentioned earlier, we've got over $400 million in debt due later this year. So of course, with the peak second quarter, we're kind of -- we've got higher cash balances and seasonally, that's typically the case. So that's just another factor. So we're looking ahead at what our needs are and with the overall goal in mind to enhance shareholder value through either deploying capital back to our shareholders. And also as Gary mentioned, we want to continue to grow the airline.","Gary C. Kelly","Just trying to be real quick with you here. I think if I just take your questions literally, is it too conservative? I would say no, it's not too conservative. Is it too aggressive? No. So is it the exact right spot? I don't know that I'm ready to answer that quite yet. So we continue to -- as you know, the rating agencies don't just look at leverage. In fact, interestingly enough, they don't look at leverage much at all. And that's the way we normally casually talk about it. So there's other things that they look at and we'll want to continue to work with them in an effort to try to improve the credit rating. I think that, that would be better than being so close to junk. On the other hand, if trends continue for several years like they have been for the last couple, that the balance sheet's going to continue to show less and less leverage. And yes, it is possible when it gets to a point where we think that it's \"too conservative,\" but I don't feel that we're there right now. And like Tammy, said I think that's a high-class problem and something ultimately can be managed. The only other thing that I think needs to be mentioned here is that we've lived through a brutal decade where every balance sheet in the industry was stressed and most went bankrupt. So you just can't extrapolate 2014 into infinity. And we do want to make sure that we err on this side financially of being conservative and being very well prepared for the unpredictable. And the unpredictable's happened a lot to us in 43 years. But again, it's not say that we're worried. We're not. We're feeling very confident, very good and very pleased with this quarter and very pleased with our outlook.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I definitely appreciate all of that. If I could just ask a separate question, Gary, on your international expansion. Can you help us understand your thought process behind building depth versus breadth in your network? And then sort of a separate question related to the international side. Obviously, we appreciate that your fleet will have much longer range. But I'm curious as to how your unit cost advantage or competitiveness changes when you start competing against your network peers that are going to be flying larger gauge fleet.","Gary C. Kelly","Excellent questions and questions that again sort of put in that high-class problem category. Well, we're going to have to choose, and I suppose that the choices will, from time -- from one decision point to the next will probably have different priorities, things will just change. We want to do both. We certainly want to increase the diversity and the breadth of our route system. But we have opportunities that we haven't seen in quite some time to also improve the depth in a lot of our markets. And those are the exact conversations and debates that our commercial experts are having right now. I'd rather not tip our hand as to exactly what we might do. But again, just to put it in perspective for everyone, international right now is 1% of Southwest route system. So it is a very, very small component, and it's going to be small for a long time. So I think that may very well help direct us in the future as to how we think about additional flights from one schedule to the next. But 50 dots on the route map obviously is a great opportunity to increase the breadth. And again, all this has to fit in with hitting our return requirements. I think by definition, increasing the depth, one would think would be less risk as opposed to increasing the size of the route network. So all that will have to be factored in as well. So we've got a great opportunity to grow, grow the earnings and continue as we grow the capital base, along with the growth in earnings to hit our 15% minimum target. And it's very exciting and we've got opportunities to do both. So that's, again, a very high-quality problem.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate it's late in the call. I mean, do you care to comment on -- just a last question about unit cost competitiveness over the longer haul? Or is it just...","Gary C. Kelly","I'm sorry. Yes, I didn't skip it on purpose. I'd forgotten to answer the question. Well, I think, yes, as you go longer, it gives us less ability to bring our strength, which is efficiency and turning airplanes. It makes a little bit harder to bring that competitively to the market. So that will have to be factored in. I don't know that we are well prepared for \"ultra long-haul flying\". But we feel we have a very solid cost advantage with the 737 and in the route network that we're envisioning to, again, North America and the northern part of South America. So I think that, that holds true at least with the analysis that we've done. And that's been the case over a number of years. We want to continue being the low-cost producer and work hard to achieve that position and then maintain it, and certainly, we want to be known as the low-fare brand and that we're going to work hard to sustain that as well.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. And thanks again to everyone for joining our call today. As always, I'll be available this afternoon if you have any additional questions. Thanks again.","Operator",".","Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Ginger Hardage, Senior Vice President, Culture and Communications.","Ginger C. Hardage","Great. Thank you, Tom. And we would like to welcome all the members of the news media who might have questions for Tammy and Gary. So I think Tom's going to give instructions and we'll get that started.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Mike Sasso with Bloomberg News.","Michael Sasso","I noticed that you announced earlier that you're going to purchase 17 preowned 737s. I noted as I was on the call earlier with United folks and they announced a kind of a new strategy for them to buy used, and certainly Delta is kind of well-known for pursuing that strategy. I wonder if you could just talk about used planes and -- as a strategy and kind of what's going on with that?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, sure. We -- for us, it's not new either. I think we used the preowned market historically for more tactical growth opportunities. And we were very active in the 1990s, in particular, going out into the used market, finding good airplanes and have the capability of quickly converting them to the Southwest livery, and putting them into revenue service. That is a -- when the market is available, that is a very good strategy. And in particular, it works well for us right now. So what is unique for Southwest is that we're an all-737 carrier. We are the launch customer for the 737 MAX, which is coming online in 2017. And it -- all the indications are it will be a vastly superior aircraft from an economic perspective. So if our Chief Operating Officer had is druthers, he'd rather be getting those airplanes new right now as opposed to the current generation. So a wonderful way to bridge the gap is to go into the used market rather than buying the current generation new from Boeing, understanding that we'll be using them for a shorter period of time, but that just means that we'll get the 737 MAX that much faster again compared to buying an airplane here in 2014 and keeping it for 30 years. That all works great, that's a great strategy, but the airplanes have to be available. And it just so happens that there are a lot of 737-700s on the used markets at attractive prices that are available. If they are not, then I'm sure we wouldn't continue to pursue that strategy. So everything has to come together. We love the 737-700, which is the NG product. That's what Mike is picking up and economics are fantastic, so I think that works very well. So it's not necessarily a new strategy for us. The circumstances are different this time that caused us to pursue that. But it definitely helps us manage our capital spending at a time where we would like to not only replace retiring equipment, but also begin to pick up new units to grow. So all way around, I think it's a great strategy and something that's working very well for us.","Michael Sasso","And so a quick follow-up. You said there are a lot of 737-700s on the market. Why is that right now?","Gary C. Kelly","Mike, you want to speak to that?","Michael G. Van De Ven","Yes, Mike, it's just a function of them rolling off lessors' order leasing books. So they typically lease the airplane out anywhere from 8, 10, 12, up to 20 years. And they roll into the marketplace, and we just have a bow [ph] wave of them rolling in the market place over the next couple of years.","Gary C. Kelly","And we're the largest 737-700 operator in the world, and it's an airplane that we really like. And it could be that other airlines are pursuing other aircraft types. It's often hard to know, but we like that airplane and for whatever reasons, there's a lot of them. And that was Mike Van De Ven, our COO by the way, that was answering that question.","Tammy Romo","And just one thing to add. The lessors love to lease the Southwest Airlines because we do have a very strong balance sheet.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, you heard the question earlier about our credit rating, and Tammy makes an outstanding point. Yes, which we are a preferred customer for anybody who wants to get paid.","Tammy Romo","That is correct.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal.","Doug Cameron","This is one for Gary or maybe Ron. Going back to the international expansion, guys, I see you've been sort of active in some DOT dockets with regard to potential Mexico flights, which kind of makes me think, I wonder if any of the international expansion in that region is kind of dependent on any regulatory changes, be it either bilateral or whether there's kind of plentiful opportunities for you with the status quo as far as current air service agreements are concerned.","Gary C. Kelly","Ron Ricks, our EVP and Chief Regulatory and Legal Officer, will step up to the microphone here.","Ron Ricks","I think the only new development there that might merit some attention is that the United States and Mexico are discussing a new bilateral. And what we're hearing is that for the first time in quite some time -- by the way, I don't think the treaty between the 2 countries has been renegotiated since the early 1960s. But for the first time since then, Mexico is interested in liberalizing that treaty, liberalizing this context, meaning more opportunities for more flights by U.S. carriers. That is a goal that we support, and it's something we're urging the United States government to pursue in the negotiations in hopes that we can achieve a new bilateral sooner rather than later, which means expanded opportunities for us.","Doug Cameron","[Indiscernible] there are only 2 or 3 designations. Now, Ron, you're confident you could get one of those if and when you decide to fly from Hobby or any other points?","Ron Ricks","There are a number -- if I understand your question, there are a number of routes that we're interested in pursuing over the short-term and there are opportunities. But the point of the new bilateral negotiations is to expand that list more and -- so that we can have more opportunity. But I think regardless of whether there's a new treaty or not, to Gary's earlier commentary, there are plenty of opportunities for us, again a high-class problem. There are lots of places we can go, so we don't think we'll be route-restricted, if that's a concern. But on the other hand, Mexico is a very attractive place for us to fly our existing route structure in the demographics of the United States today. And if there are more opportunities in Mexico, then I'm sure Mr. Andrew Watterson and his team and our network planning group would be happy to pursue them.","Gary C. Kelly","And Doug, the other thing -- so Ron is acknowledging -- we're acknowledging that there may be some city pair routes that we can't get the route authority to fly. We know that. But the thing that is different about Southwest Airlines is we have dozens of cities that we have point-to-point networks that originate from. So we have routes into Mexico right now from Orange County, California; Austin, Texas; San Antonio, Texas as an example. So we -- Houston may not be open to us to certain Mexican cities, but I'll bet we can find other spots on the Southwest system that are. But in any event, we have 50 potential beyond 48 state destinations. And if we can't go one place, we'll have ample opportunities to go somewhere else. And as a practical matter, we simply cannot satisfy all the growth opportunities at the same time anyway. So it will help prioritize if we're restricted. But clearly, we're in support. And Ron made this clear, we're in support of liberalizing the bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico and that will bring more competition. That will lower fares, it will be better for consumers. So it's not just about us selfishly. It's really what's good for consumers.","Operator","Our question comes from David Koenig with the Associated Press.","David Koenig","I will make it easy, an easy one here. Gary, I know that -- I see that the release does talk about a 3% present [ph] gain expected in July over last July. Anything else you can say about demand in the third quarter and bookings? And part of that is how soon do you expect it's going to be into everybody starts dumping a bunch of extra capacity into the system?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think that capacity -- just go backwards with your question. I think the supply side of this is generally a longer cycle. So, I mean, if you just look at us, if we wanted to add more flights next month, we just -- we couldn't do it. That's a fairly long lead time that's required to require equipment, hire and train employees, et cetera. So right now, the demand is very strong and it is balanced very nicely with the supply of seats. We're going to manage our growth very carefully so that we don't upset that balance for Southwest Airlines. And what the rest of the industry does, of course, I can't speak to. I think David, the bigger risk, personally, is the economy and fuel prices. With all the turmoil there is in the Middle East, things could change quite rapidly, and I'm much more concerned about that. The demand side things, if you will, are continuing to be stable and strong as opposed to a radical change in the supply side anytime soon.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Hardage for any additional or closing remarks.","Ginger C.

Joining me on the call is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President, and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President of Finance, and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, and President of AirTran Airways. We will begin with opening remarks from Gary followed by Tammy providing a review of our results and our current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy\u2019s remarks.","Please be advised that today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company\u2019s current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please refer to this morning\u2019s press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary C. Kelly","","Thank you Marcy and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2014 earnings call. I know it\u2019s a busy day for you all and glad you all can join us. I\u2019m very pleased with our financial results. I\u2019m very proud of our people, especially. Third quarter is a very busy season. Our people work hard every single day to sever our customers with safe, reliable, friendly, and low-cost air travel and sometimes under very challenging circumstances.","So these results really were a testament to their very hard work. The transformative changes with a new rapid rewards program, the acquisition and integration of AirTran, the addition of the 737-800 model, and our fleet modernization program have also been very hard work. And again, my profound things to our people for working through those changes so magnificently and the stellar results, of course, are very obvious.","One historic milestone achieved in third quarter was the launch of international service on July 1st. We talked about that in the second quarter earnings call in late July. And I\u2019ll just say again it was flawless. I\u2019m very proud of our people again for their hard work in what is a very exciting achievement. The customer and operational aspects of our international launch have been stellar. From a business or commercial perspective, our international results are in line with our expectations. I will admit to you all they are a drag on our results. Right now, we\u2019ve got some work to do.","And accordingly, our international footprint is quite modest. It\u2019s about 1% of our capacity. And also just, we\u2019d remind everyone that our growth plans in 2015 for international are modest as well. So we plan to manage our near-term \u2013 our near international expansion very carefully and very closely, but again that said, we\u2019re pleased with current status. We plan to open Costa Rica in March, as well as a handful of other destinations next year all with low frequency.","Another historic third quarter event was the unveiling of our new Heart livery along with our new Heart branding and logo, the same Heart, but a new look. It\u2019s a tribute to our employees, who are the best in the business. It signifies that as of 2014 Southwest has exciting new capabilities and exciting new opportunities and unlike the Southwest before. In typical Southwest fashion, we\u2019ll rollout the refresh livery and branding in a cost neutral manner during the normal maintenance cycle or out of our discretionary marketing budget.","Since the end of the quarter, the long anticipated repeal of the Wright Amendment happened, the long anticipated Southwest effect happened too. And on October 13, we added seven new non-stop destinations, 22 more daily departures to Dallas Love Field that was the largest single day expansion in our history. And load factors so far have been in excess of 90% on these 22 new flights. So I\u2019m going to talk to Bob Jordan about the few empty seats that he has later.","Eight more destinations are coming November 2nd, and I expect that they will do equally well. Also in November, we will finish adding flights using the DCA slots that we bought from American Airlines. We began adding service to DCA with the new slots back in August, where we went from 17 daily departures with seven non-stop destinations up to, in November we\u2019ll be 44 daily departures and double the destinations, or 14.","And I\u2019d just remind everybody that\u2019s not a net capacity increase to the industry; it is obviously a significant capacity increase for Southwest. And I expect that we\u2019re going to do quite well there as well. So no surprise, those two city initiatives will drive our year-over-year capacity growth in fourth quarter and in 2015, our international growth will be very modest especially considering that Houston doesn\u2019t open until late next year.","And finally before I turn it over to Tammy, I wanted to thank the IAM leadership for the tentative agreement that was announced yesterday and especially I want to congratulate our customer service and consumer support and services employees, who represented by the IAM. I\u2019m delighted for them. I\u2019m very pleased that we can reward our people even more for their hard work and also that they can share in the success now of a record year along with our non-contract frontline and supervisory employees. So, of course, the TA is subject to ratification by the IAM membership and I hope that there will be more TAs that will follow quickly.","With that very brief overview, I would like to turn it over to Tammy Romo, who will take us through the financial results of the third quarter.","Tammy Romo","","All right, thank you Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We are very pleased to report another terrific quarter this morning again breaking many records. Net income, excluding special items, was a record $382 million, or $0.55 per share, which increased approximately 60% over last year. Our third quarter GAAP net income was also a record $329 million. Operating income was also a third quarter record at $649 million and we expanded our operating margin by almost 400 basis points to 13.5%.","Our pre-tax to return on invested capital for the twelve months ended September 30was 19%, which on an after-tax basis was 12%, well exceeding our weighted average cost of capital. These strong results were driven by record revenues, lower fuel prices, our ongoing cost control efforts, and represents our sixth consecutive quarter on record profitability. For the nine months ended September 30, our profits have resulted in $256 million in profit sharing expense, which already exceeds full-year 2013\u2019s contribution to the plans. This is a tremendous accomplishment by our people and I congratulate and thank them for their hard work.","Our third quarter revenues reached record levels increasing 5.6% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, driven largely by record passenger revenues of $4.6 billion. Strong demand for travel resulted in record traffic and load factors despite 4% fewer trips and 2% fewer seats flown year-over-year. We also had a double-digit growth in corporate sales and our strong initiatives continue to significantly contribute to strong revenue momentum. On a unit basis, total operating revenues increased 4.5% compared to third quarter last year on a 1% increase in available seat miles.","Passenger unit revenues increased almost 5% compared to third quarter last year with strong unit revenue improvement each month of the quarter. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, our markets under development is significantly higher than historical levels as we worked to complete the integration of AirTran. In the third quarter, we had approximately 15% of our third quarter available seat miles under development. Our international markets, as Gary commented on continued to offset ramp up nicely and are performing in line with our expectations.","As we move into fourth quarter, the demand environment remains solid and strong revenue trends revenue trends have continued. We have not seen any noticeable negative impact on demand from Ebola or macroeconomic news. And based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we expect October PRASM to up roughly 2% year-over-year. Bookings for November and December are also good. Looking ahead, we expect unit revenue trends to be choppy through the remainder of the quarter due to last year\u2019s comparisons. December\u2019s in particular would be difficult given last year\u2019s as strong increase. In particular, Thanksgiving at Monday return traffic will benefit November this year as opposed to December last year.","Moving to freight and other revenues, our freight revenues grew nearly 10% year-over-year, as we continued to expand cargo service, and with the integration of our AirTran network. And we currently expect fourth quarter freight revenues to be comparable to third quarter 2014. Other revenues decreased at 3.5% year-over-year are largely due to AirTran fees continuing to decline with the transition of the AirTran network over to Southwest.","EarlyBird revenue performance continues to be strong, and were $59 million in the quarter. And other ancillary revenues were also $48 million. We currently expect fourth quarter 2014 other revenues to decrease year-over-year, likely at a greater year-over-year rate than we experienced in the third quarter due to the ongoing conversion of the AirTran network.","Turning now to costs, we had a solid cost performance. Our third quarter unit costs excluding a special items for comparable on a year-over-year basis. And we\u2019re continuing to benefit, as Gary mentioned, from our fleet modernization and other cost control efforts, as well as lower fuel costs. Our third quarter economic jet fuel price per gallon declined 3.9% year-over-year to $2.94, which reflect a $0.05 hedging gain.","Fuel prices have plunged even further here in October, reaching levels we haven\u2019t seen for four years, primarily driven by heavy oversupply crude based on our hedge position and market prices and as of Friday, we expect our fourth quarter fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.70 and $2.75 range.","This is right in line with un-hedged prices, and significantly below fourth quarter last year\u2019s $3 05 per gallon. Excluding special items and fuel and oil expense, our unit costs increased 2.6% year-over-year, largely driven by the 45% increase in profit sharing, which of course we like to see.","Excluding profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit costs increased 1.5% year-over-year as expected. Based on current cost trends, we expect fourth quarter and full year 2014 unit costs, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing, to increase year-over-year in the 2% range. And this guidance contemplates the ratification of the tentative agreement that was announced yesterday with our customer service agents and customer representatives.","Moving to our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we ended third quarter 2014 with $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. As a result of our strong free cash flow generation of $1.4 billion this year, we have returned $893 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of $755 million of stocks and the distribution of $138 million in dividends. Over the past three years, we have returned a meaningful $2.1 billion to our shareholders. In third quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased $200 million in shares under an accelerated stock repurchase programs and distributed $41 million in dividend payments. We have $580 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization.","Thus far this year, we have also made $517 million in debt payments including $48 million paid during the quarter and an additional $315 million made in early October. We intend to repay an additional $40 million in scheduled debt and capital lease payments in the reminder of this year. Our leverage including off-balance sheet aircraft leases was 36% as of September 30 and we continue to prudently manage our CapEx spend. Our 2014 capital spending forecast remains at $1.8 billion and we currently expect our 2015 CapEx to be less than this year\u2019s spend.","And that brings me to the fleet. I\u2019ll refer you to our press release for our third quarter activity, but here is a quick recap of our full-year 2014 fleet plans. We plan to take delivery of 33 - 800s from Boeing and 23 pre-owned \u2013 700s. On the retirement side, we have retired three classics thus far this year and currently plan to retire our three more by the end of the year for a total of six retirements this year. We have removed 51 of the AirTran 717s from service.","The remaining 37 will be removed from service by the end of this year. As of the end of the third quarter, we have transitioned 45 717s to Delta and currently plan to transition 7 more this year. In addition, thus far, we have transitioned 34 of the 52 AirTran-700s to Southwest, which leaves 18-700 aircraft remaining. We continued to manage our fleet plans to a relatively flat fleet through the end of 2015, with a baseline of roughly 695 aircraft, which was our combined fleet at the time of the AirTran acquisition. We expect our fourth quarter 2014 ASMs to increase year-over-year in 2% to 3% range and full year 2014 ASMs to be less than 1% year-over-year.","To close, we are thrilled with our third quarter results. Our outstanding employees continue to give their very best, and I would to like to congratulate them on another record quarterly performance.","The revenue momentum in the third quarter has continued thus far into fourth quarter. Our cost control efforts are working as planned. And we will continue to focus on maintaining our low-cost leadership position.","Our strategic initiatives have all come together quite well, and puts us in a great position to take advantage of recent opportunities such as Dallas Love Field, Washington Reagan National, New York LaGuardia, and our most recent announcement of our first international destination to Central America.","We are excited about our future, and our financial position remains strong as ever, allowing us to deliver on our plans to aggressively manage our invested capital and return strong returns and significant value to our shareholders.","And with that, we\u2019re ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We are now beginning with our first question, I\u2019m sorry the question-and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) And thank you for waiting. We will now begin with our first question from Hunter Kaey, with Wolf Research.","Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi, thank you, everybody. How are you?","Gary C. Kelly","Looks good.","Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Good. Have you seen any improvements or an improved ability to revenue manage after changing the no-show policy? I know it\u2019s a small percentage of your customers that are impacted by that, but in those specific markets or those specific customers that were impacted by it, maybe it was more magnified in certain business markets at certain times of day or something like that. Have you found an improved ability to manage yields around tightening of the restrictions a little bit?","Gary C. Kelly","","Well, it\u2019s probably a little early to tell. I think it\u2019s probably nuanced. It\u2019s definitely helped us to identify empty seats and we\u2019re having one or things to happen either the cancellations are happening in advance where we can resell the seats or that money is being forfeited. So it\u2019s sort of the worst to both worlds would be if the customer cancelled at a very last minute where we can\u2019t do anything about it and we go ahead and get the money back, but the revenue management over \u2013 Hunter, I can\u2019t recall how you\u2019ve been following us or the industry, but if you go back 30 years, we had over bookings that was substantially higher than what we have today. Today, the bookings that we would take for departure are very close to the number of seats that we have.","So I can\u2019t honestly say that we\u2019ve seen with precision any additional improvement on that, there is bound to be some in there, but it will probably take us a little bit more time to see that. But the benefits are there, the revenue management right now is already very good in terms of the bookings versus the book load factor. This obviously will help, but I guess to give you an honest answer, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve seen anything, any evidence of that so far. Tammy have you?","Tammy Romo","","The only thing I would add, Gary, is that we could see a nice benefit here just on the no show here in the third quarter, it was about close to $25 million here in the third quarter, but it is meaningful.","Gary C. Kelly","","Yes, it\u2019s meaningful. That\u2019s more than what we get from our upgraded boarding product on a quarterly basis as a reference point.","Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research","","Yes. That\u2019s interesting. I\u2019ve not been covering you for 30 years, but I think maybe Jamie Baker has that...","Gary C. Kelly","I don\u2019t think you\u2019re that older, are you?","","Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research","I don\u2019t. Believe it or not, I am over 30, but that\u2019s nice of you. So, one other question on labor, Gary. Can you tell me what is important to you with a new pilot deal? And I am not asking you where you guys are far apart or where you\u2019re close together. That\u2019s a completely different question. But what\u2019s important to you, Gary, as you sit down and negotiate with labor? Is it more healthcare contribution? Is it productivity? Can you talk to me about what you value out of the next CBA from the pilots?","Gary C. Kelly","","Well, I wouldn\u2019t saying were pilots. We\u2019re\u2026","Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research","","Of course not, but I\u2019m just referring to the pilots.","Robert E. Jordan","With a number of workgroups and all of them are important. I think the themes are consistent across which is Southwest has a very rich history, very meaningful purpose and we want to sustain that for the next generation. And that is we want to offer our customers great service at a low cost. And that\u2019s what I want to work together with our union leaders to make sure that we sustain going forward.","As you well know we have more low cost competition today than ever before in our history and we can\u2019t claim the lowest cost although we are really close, we still can\u2019t that. And I think that\u2019s something that we need to continue to strive for. So that\u2019s number one, that is an important objective, because taking care of Southwest Airline and sustaining our brand really is taking care of our people.","So to further taking care of our people we have some wonderful opportunities where we can reward them further just like I described with the tentative agreement we have with the IAM. That\u2019s what we want to achieve with these one of our work groups, do more for our people and find ways to strengthen Southwest Airlines by eliminating waste, improving our productivity, improving our efficiencies. And the nice thing is there are opportunities in every single work group to do to.","Hunter Kaey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question form Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning. What percentage of routes are under development if you exclude the AirTran routes you are taking over?","Gary C. Kelly","I don\u2019t know if I can do that. The way we think about the percentage of routes in development I would say it\u2019s about 15%. And I know Bob Jordan and his team have plans \u2013 already committed plans from next year, to grow that further. I think we get close to 20%, don\u2019t we, Bob?","Robert E. Jordan","Yes we do.","Gary C. Kelly","So that\u2019s more than we\u2019d like, but it is directly tied to the AirTran acquisition and integration. In other words, absent that we wouldn\u2019t have anywhere near that number of new markets, as a component of our system. So I don\u2019t know that I can really piece it apart. Bob, do you have a different way of thinking about that.","Robert E. Jordan","No. The other thing that I think is important to point out is we are counting everything new is new. So, if you look at Love Field, even though we served these long-haul destinations through connections, now that we have new non-stops, those are counted as new markets. And when you think about that 15% grown to 20% as well.","Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Robert E. Jordan","And it takes a year or two for those to develop, even though we do expect a market like Dallas to mature much faster. So I would say where we are with the AirTran is probably split pretty even, the AirTran markets that are being converted and in these new markets like DCA and Dallas.","Gary C. Kelly","And, again, we\u2019ve tried to be as transparent with those as possible. But even if you take a city like Flint, Michigan, it was converted from AirTran to Southwest, the routes that we fly \u2013 Memphis is probably the same example. The routes we fly to those cities are entirely different than what AirTran was flying before. There are some cases where we take a route that AirTran was flying, change the sign and make it Southwest.","And one could imagine that that\u2019s less risk than what I described with the Flint scenario, but you\u2019ve got every flavor of all that going on. And I guess just, finally, just to wrap up the answer, the AirTran route system or what was previously AirTran capacity converted to Southwest, what that looks like today compared to when we bought AirTran is very different. We\u2019ve closed 18 AirTran cities. We\u2019ve opened 51 or converted \u2013 either opened or converted 51 of AirTran cities, but you can just envision that that\u2019s a pretty different route system today compared to where they were in 2011.","Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That\u2019s helpful. And just looking at 2015, I understand not a lot of the capacity is going to be international. What level of capacity growth, have you massaged that number more as we look at 2015 that you will be adding to the domestic market?","Gary C. Kelly","We have and our focus will be on that question when we have our Investor Meeting next month. Today we\u2019re going to focus on the third and the fourth quarter, of course, but, yes we\u2019re working on finalizing our plans for 2015 as we speak.","Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I\u2019ll wait for that then. Maybe just, since I didn\u2019t get an answer to that, may I ask? So once you do start flying out of Houston, what could you grow your international capacity at?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, Bob and I were talking earlier this morning our initial launch out of Houston. If you just look at \u2013 think about fourth quarter 2015, the capacity increased compared to fourth quarter 2014, assuming that Houston international is open all quarter will be very modest. So we\u2019ll have just a handful of flights. It will not generate a significant amount of growth coming out of Houston international. It sounds like 1% or less. What is known is that the terminal will have five gates, and it\u2019s estimated that the capacity of the five gates will be 25 daily departures.","So I think it remains to be seen whether that\u2019s the cap or whether we will be able to do more departures than that. And we will have four of those five gates under lease. So that at least gives you some idea what the potential is out of Houston.","Savi Syth \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Company","","Hi, thank you for taking my question. Tammy, when you pointed out the fuel volatility in a historical context, I couldn\u2019t help but remember maybe some of the problems that airlines found themselves in when they were hedging and they had to put up cash collateral. I know that you have a lot of disclosures on this. They\u2019re a bit complicated, but there are a bunch of disclosures in the K and the Q. I was hoping that you could maybe boil it down to a simple thought. Does the fuel volatility that we\u2019ve seen to date create any cash collateral issues for you?","Tammy Romo","Nothing that we really couldn\u2019t manage, we really shored up our any liquidity, our risk, with our aircraft collateral facility. And we currently have the full $1.2 billion in aircraft collateral available, should prices fall further. At least so far the any cash collateral that we have had to post has been very manageable.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Company","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then if we could talk a little bit about capital returns to shareholders. You obviously have a great leverage ratio versus peers. And a lot of airlines are now comping themselves to high quality industrials. Perhaps you have been comped to that group much longer than others. I just wonder, when are we reaching a point where we can perhaps commit to the marketplace that the vast majority of incremental free cash flow would be used for shareholder returns, buy backs, or what have you?","Tammy Romo","As you already said, we really have led the industry in shareholder returns, and certainly this year. We\u2019re very proud of what we have deployed back to our shareholders. In terms of how we intend to deploy our capital going forward, we\u2019ll certainly touch on our 2015 plan when we meet with you all in a couple of weeks. But certainly as the free cash flow levels that we have been enjoying, and our very, I think, manageable CapEx are requirements. Certainly our goal would be to continue to reward our shareholders through continued deployment of cash back to our shareholders.","Gary C. Kelly","The only thing that I would add is I think all I\u2019m trying to do is respond to your desire to get more commitment from the company. So I think the scenario would be as long as we are continuing to hit our return on invested capital minimum target and especially in an environment where earnings are growing. The way that I would answer your question is through the dividend. And I don\u2019t think that our dividend is fully matured, I think there are opportunities to grow it. I am not in anyways suggesting that there is a commitment from us that we will grow it. I am just saying that there are opportunities to consider that in the future.","And that is \u2013 that clearly is an opportunity for us and obviously you all have seen a very serious commitment by us to increase it over the past three years. The share repurchases \u2013 I would just say by design and by definition are intended to give the company more flexibility and what\u2019s going on in the world with fuel prices right now, a perfect example of that. The volatility is working in our direction. One of these days the volatility won\u2019t work in our direction. So I think you understand that we have to make commitments wisely in this business.","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Company","And as a philosophy, is there any reason why leverage needs to fall further?","Tammy Romo","Leverage no, not particularly. We\u2019re comfortable with where our leverage sits today. We just actually on October 1st, we repaid $350 million in debt and certainly we\u2019re likely refinanced at least a portion of that at some point in the future. And just one other note, back to just Gary\u2019s comment on the dividend \u2013 because we do get questions on that, I just remind you that we have had very substantial increases in our dividends at our last two annual shareholder meetings. And at the time we increased those dividends, the yield was 1% to 1.2%, so just wanted to remind you of that.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, the darn stocks gone up so much, it dropped the yield\u2026","John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Company","It\u2019s a high-quality problem. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates \u2013 Credit Suisse, LLC","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. ROXE continues to show very nice improvement. Is there anything you can share on how you are thinking about a new target? Or is that something we should stay tuned for the investor day?","Tammy Romo","","Yes, we\u2019ll dive into that. We are working on our plan for next year as we speak and we\u2019re looking forward to diving into that topic more when we meet here in a few weeks. But, again, our target is at least 15% and we\u2019ll talk to you more about next year\u2019s plans when we meet.","Gary C. Kelly","","And I would certainly echo 100% of what Tammy said. We\u2019re always interested to hear feedback from you all as to your views. So we\u2019re going to do more work between now and then and we\u2019ve been giving it considerable thought. I know you\u2019ll be glad to hear this. There is no thought that we would lower the target. I think all we\u2019re talking about is now, since we\u2019re in an environment where we are exceeding the minimum threshold, can we give you all some more precise guidance there. And we will be ready for that conversation in November.","Tammy Romo","","And also just want to point out, too, obviously what we\u2019re focused on when we\u2019re setting our targets is our cost to capital clearly, and our cost to capital has averaged between 7% to 8% for a long of period. So certainly with a 19% return on invested capital, we are well exceeding our cost to capital and I\u2019m very pleased with that performance.","Julie Yates \u2013 Credit Suisse, LLC","","Yes. Okay. And then a clarification on the commentary. Tammy Romo, you said choppy revenue trends in the fourth quarter and I imagine you just mean because of the comps and the shift in the timing of Thanksgiving. But I just wanted to clarify if there\u2019s any other dynamics that we should be thinking about for the fourth quarter.","","Tammy Romo","","That\u2019s primarily what I was referring to. Just as a reminder our trends for last year, if you go back to fourth quarter 2013, October was up compared to 2012 by roughly 2%. November was down about 5% and December was up 16% on a year-over-year basis. And, of course that was in part due to the timing of the holiday. So it\u2019s, to your point, very choppy. But if you look at what we\u2019re also focused on is our sequential trend and at least sequentially we\u2019re not really seeing anything on in our trends. So at this point our outlook for the fourth quarter is good.","Julie Yates \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Hey, just a follow-up on John\u2019s call about some of the counterparty positions. This is to you, Tammy. I think at the end of the June quarter you were just over $100 million that you had held from counterparties. And then just given the decline in fuel, do you have an estimate of what that swing is? Because you did mention that, I think you suggested that you are now posting with counterparties? And I am just asking so we can see how it impacted cash from quarter-to-quarter?","Tammy Romo","Sure. The market value of our fuel hedge portfolio at September 30 was a net asset of $53 million. So we did not have any collateral posted at that time. And as of Friday, the market value of our hedge portfolio was a net liability of $236 million, and we had approximately $100 million in cash collateral posted.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, that\u2019s good then. And so it sounds,","Gary C. Kelly","And Michael, while Tammy was talking I was flipping through the press release. And if you look at the cash flow statement you do see that flip.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly","Even as of the end of the quarter, there is a $98 million cash outflow.","Tammy Romo","Yeah.","Gary C. Kelly","On that cash collateral received or paid to derivative counterparties. So yeah, I mean it has its plusses and minuses, but it\u2019s all very manageable.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Yes, and it\u2019s nothing like the $1 billion-plus, maybe, that we saw back in 2008, 2009, where I think, you have now come up with a structure where you can use a letter of credit or aircraft. It\u2019s de minimis relative to what we saw a few years back.","Gary C. Kelly","Yeah. And it was on $1 billion then, but it was a bigger number, there is no doubt about it. So I think, we\u2019ve learned and\u2026","Tammy Romo","Yes. Mike, we are\u2026","Gary C. Kelly","We\u2019ve got a really strong position.","Tammy Romo","We\u2019re in good. I think we\u2019re in good shape there.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Yeah, I apologize for the hyperbole. And just one other quick one here. I know you\u2019ve talked about the international service from Houston in the latter part of the year 2015. I did, it does look like you loaded a Houston-Aruba service starting this March. And when I saw that I thought, okay, the terminal is ready. Is that just taking advantage of a pre-clearance facility in Aruba? What\u2019s\u2026","Gary C. Kelly","That\u2019s it.","Michael Linenberg \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, all right, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC.","Thanks very much, operator. Hi guys, thank you for the time.","Tammy Romo","Hi, Helane.","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC.","Hi. So here is one of my questions. With respect to your schedule adjustment that you did in August in an effort to improve on time performance because I guess when you were doing 10-minute turns your aircraft were a whole lot smaller so you were carrying fewer people relative to what you are doing now. Can you talk about how that\u2019s improved your overall operations and where you stand relative to your goals for improving on time? Thanks.","Gary C. Kelly","But we\u2019ve had a little over 60 days I guess with the, quote, new schedule, and I would say that is performing exactly as intended. We will need a little bit more experience to decide whether it needs more turning, but at times we\u2019ve had some unusual spring like weather. We had the fire at the Chicago tower which disrupted our on-time performance because of a disruption in the operation. The tower is up and running since the October 13, the on-time performance and the weather has been pretty good and the on-time performance has been superb. So we\u2019ve had very strong load factors this month and very strong on-time performance.","So I am very happy now Mike Van De Ven already to add I don\u2019t know if I would call it insurance, but more operational recoverability with our April schedule. So he is going to getting more help there from a scheduling perspective i.e., you will have more airplanes to recover with. Just to make sure that we get out of a pace of hopefully somewhere in the 83% to plus 85% range and then we\u2019ll tune it from there, but I am very pleased with it and its working I think Mike pretty much as designed.","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC.","Okay, great. And then I just have one follow-up question. Somebody asked me this yesterday and I didn\u2019t really have a good \u2013 I didn\u2019t have any answer. The question was when will you announce service to Hawaii?","Gary C. Kelly","We know why you didn\u2019t have an answer to that question because you don\u2019t know. And you know what, neither do I.","Helane R. Becker \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC.","That\u2019s certainly fair. Thank you. See you in a few weeks.","Gary C. Kelly","I\u2019m looking forward into it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.","Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","","Hi, sorry about that, I was just adjusting my earpiece. I don\u2019t want to myopically obsess on the immediate term but the stock has responded poorly to the 2% October revenue guide, particularly given the easier year-over-year comp relative to the month of September. Could you add any color on this? For example, what sort of pressures that perhaps that new routes are putting on RASM. And maybe if you had a same-store sales RASM guide that you could provide something that strips out, let\u2019s say, LaGuardia and DCA, for example?","Tammy Romo","Well, nothing really Jam, if you look at there is really nothing unusual about standing out in our comp if you look at it. If you look at our performance from September relative to October, there is really nothing odd there in sequential. And again, there is some noise in the year-over-year comparison. So there \u2013 so aside from that, nothing really stands out. So I guess the only other thing I would point out is we do have sequentially few more ASMs and then of course another important point to note is the increasing stage length from just the riding and the flying, so but nothing really unusual.","Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Okay. And for the follow-up similar question as to when I asked last quarter, you had and it relates to labor. You\u2019ve had three more months to begin and better understand what the asks are from your flight attendants and pilots. You\u2019ve had three more months to look around the industry, both here and aboard to see what labor efficiencies some competing airlines might have, that you don\u2019t. How that process is going overall. And how confident should we be that renegotiated contracts and put material pressure on margins next year?","Tammy Romo","Well, again I\u2019m pleased with the leadership that the IM has exhibited here and I think Tammy has already shared that the anticipated effects of that tentative agreement are already baked into our expectations going forward. So we got opportunities to do more for people and we\u2019ve got opportunities to improve the efficiency of the company which benefits our people. So I\u2019m very confident we are making good progress. I don\u2019t, Jamie, I don\u2019t know we\u2019ve learned anything different or more in the last 90 days with respect to that point. But we have made progress from a negotiating standpoint with several of our new, new groups. I\u2019m very pleased with that.","Jamie N. Baker \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Excellent, solid quarter, solid guide. Thank you both.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just a follow-up to Jamie\u2019s question, can you talk about how much sort of fare sale activity in Dallas is impacting that October RASM number?","Tammy Romo","As I mentioned earlier part of the sequentially is we are doing more flying as a result of our Wright Amendment flying. Yes, we did have introductory fares, but we\u2019re seeing great high sales, but we\u2019re seeing very high load factors. So, yes, nothing notable.","Gary C. Kelly","","There are no issues. I think it is literally the sequential cost what\u2019s normal to us. The year-over-year comps just have to be studied and understood if there is some question about that, but there is no change in trend in October. October was very strong, very high load factors, very good on-time performance, very solid yields.","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Appreciate that. And then just I wonder if you could quantify the number of idle aircraft, maybe non-productive aircraft that are also not spares in the fleet in 2014 versus your expectations for 2015. It seems like you\u2019ll start to get some benefits from a more productive fleet next year.","Gary C. Kelly","","The utilization is up in 2014 compared to 2013 at the same time that we were putting arguably more aircraft out-of-service to go through various transitions. And that schedule just proved to be a little too tight. So the on-time performance suffered. So there is a couple of things going on even in 2013, 2014 that are confusing and I think we\u2019ll have an opportunity, Duane, in November to give you all better insights as to where we\u2019ve been, where we are, and where we\u2019re headed in 2015.","The number that I have off the top of my head is about 20 airplanes, additional, out-of-service on average. So if you\u2019ll just take that number with a grain of salt because it\u2019s \u2013 I think that is a good representation of what the opportunity is in 2015, but we probably have a little bit more homework to do. I don\u2019t recall any off the top of my head is the average for 2015 is 20 more in service than what we have here in 2014, but looking backwards, Duane, the number of in-service fell about 20 as you went from 2012, 2013 into 2014. And so that\u2019s the opportunity going forward to restore into service with no change in the total fleet. That answers to your question?","Duane Pfennigwerth \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","","It does. Thanks very much. See you soon.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Glenn Engel with Bank of America.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Good afternoon. A couple questions, please. One, fuel hedges, you indicated that it really is not going to have much of an impact in the fourth quarter, meaning they are not hurting your P&L. Does that $200 million loss result in an impact in your fuel cost per gallon next year?","Tammy Romo","We\u2019ll give you \u2013 again we\u2019ll discuss our 2015 guidance here in a couple of weeks, but at least so far, Glenn, we\u2019re participating in 80% of the decline that we\u2019ve seen. So and of course we\u2019ll enjoying lower physical prices. So we\u2019ll give you guidance here in a couple weeks as we discuss our plan in full. But at least so far everything looks pretty good. Our treasury team is doing I think a very nice job of managing our hedge book in this very volatile market. Again, we had a $0.05 gain here in the third quarter and we\u2019re paying roughly market prices here in the fourth quarter. And so far we\u2019re participating in the majority of the market decline.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, and again I wouldn\u2019t call it a $200 million loss either. You understand the mark-to-market things that we deal with and you have to suffer with too in our reporting, but the projective settlement is not anywhere near what the mark-to-market is. So I think all that we could probably elaborate in November, but I think it\u2019s all very manageable and who knows where prices were going to go from here. It is the other thing that I know you well know. So it flipped around in one quarter. It can flip the other way in another quarter or two as well. So that\u2019s what the hedging portfolio is for is to try to position us, so that we can manage our total spend through all this volatility.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Unfortunately, I have been doing this for 30 years. Head count is up 1.3%. Your trips are down 4%. Your fleet is down slightly. When do we start seeing productivity?","Gary C. Kelly","I think that somewhat relates to Duane\u2019s earlier question. So in terms of the aircraft available for service, the productivity for the fleet this year looks pretty good except that the on-time performance suffered. The AirTran segment is under scheduled. I think we have been sharing that with you all frequently. In the Southwest segment arguably, at least for part of this year, it was quote overscheduled. So I think we definitely have opportunities to smooth all that out after the AirTran and integration that\u2019s complete. And then you\u2019ve got on the order of 20 aircraft out of service coming back into service, which will also be another productivity improvement, beginning in 2015 and again, we need to share that with you all in more detail in November.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And actually\u2026","Gary C. Kelly","2016 Glenn, is the year where I think, Tammy, things are pretty clean. So it is just another illustration for everyone that there is a lot of noise in the Southwest performance right now and just another illustration of how strong the results really are. So a lot of this noise gets cleaned up here in 2014. There is still some in 2015 and by the time it gets 2016 we\u2019re clear of it.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And, lastly, it seems like you purchased a whole bunch more used aircraft in the last three months. Is that going to be lifting what you think 2015 capacity growth is, some?","Tammy Romo","Glenn, we\u2019ve been commenting all along that we\u2019re managing to a flat fleet of $695. So all of that was part of the plan. So no, no new news there.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, remember we\u2019re retiring 88 717s in a \u2013 what 30-month period. So that\u2019s all you\u2019re seeing there.","Tammy Romo","Yes, we don\u2019t have all of that, of course, perfectly time. But there were no new information there. We\u2019ve been saying all along that we\u2019re going to augment our firm deliveries from Boeing with aircraft from the pre-owned market.","Glenn Engel \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you very much.","Tammy Romo","Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Joe DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus &Co.","Hi, good morning. Gary or Tammy, I am wondering if the success you\u2019ve had with the change to your no-show policy. I can\u2019t imagine that much impact on customer loyalty if that\u2019s changed the way you think about your reservation change policy?","Gary C. Kelly","You mean our changed fee\u2026","Joseph W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus &Co.","Yes.","Gary C. Kelly","So I\u2019ll just give you an answer before an explanation. I don\u2019t think that there is any correlation. I think most reasonable people understands the fairness of a no-show policy. But if I am not going to show up, I can at least give the airline that the notice that they have the seat back for resell. I got to keep my money and use it again. I think that that is eminently fair. Most of the complaints I get from customers above that is they didn\u2019t know.","They didn\u2019t realize that that policy was in effect. And they don\u2019t like it. so I will \u2013 I am not going to try to argue with you that the customers don\u2019t care about it, because they don\u2019t like the no-show policy, those that stumble into it. But our customers, for the most part now have adapted well to that. And it\u2019s very fair. Change fee is very different we and don\u2019t have any plans to make a change to our policy. I would lump that in at least it would have answered, you know, about bag fees. So no plans to make any changes to either one of us.","Joseph W. DeNardi \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus &Co.","Okay. And then, Tammy, I think last quarter you talked about first quarter capacity up about 5%. I\u2019m wondering if you have a similar outlook for second quarter now.","Tammy Romo","We are going to share all of that with you here in a couple of weeks. So, stay tuned on that. We\u2019ll walk through our capacity plans in some detail. But really what we said you know for our 2015 is that we\u2019re expecting our seat to increase about 3% and of course I assume year-over-year would exceed that because of the nature of that flying. It will be more longer haul and to the point Gary made earlier on utilization just to increase the utilization of the fleet.","Gary C. Kelly","And, again, I would just recap the overview right now for you all for 2015 is really nothing has changed. The fleet plans are unchanged. We\u2019ll be roughly flat, maybe a few more units at the end of 2015. The seats are increasing simply because the gauge is increasing. We may end up with some increase in trips, but it won\u2019t be very much. Where we\u2019re expanding is as important to the conversation is anything which is its Dallas Love Field, and most of that you know, there is a few things that we may do that Love Field next year, but the vast majority you know.","And I mentioned to you DCA. And then just again reemphasized with everyone that the most ambitious expansion for us is international and our international plants are very measured and will have only a modest impact on our capacity growth next year. So those are the headlines, those are not new. We\u2019re in the final stages of completing our 2015 plan and anxious to share it with you all in a month.","Tammy Romo","Just to emphasize where the capacity is going is what\u2019s important here for the first quarter virtually most of that capacity is going into Dallas Love Field.","Operator","And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","","Thanks, Tom. I just want to thank everyone again for joining us today and have a great day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President Communication & Outreach.","Linda B. Rutherford","","Good afternoon, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019d be happy to take your questions if you go ahead, Tom, and give them the instructions to be able to queue up and do that.","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Jack Nicas with The Wall Street Journal.","Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal","","Thank you. Nice quarter everyone. I\u2019d like to first latch on to that load factor, which I believe you say is a record and is pretty impressive compared to past quarter. Could you provide any more insight on what\u2019s behind that? Is this simply a matter of supply and demand, the demand environment is that strong? Or have you guys been fiddling with your pricing, or seeing more business travelers et cetera. Hoping you can just give us a little more detail on how you\u2019re feeling so many seats.","Gary C. Kelly","","Well, thank you, Jack. We can try. I think it\u2019s probably, unfortunately, not a simple answer because there\u2019s so much change that\u2019s going on within Southwest Airlines. We\u2019ve changed our frequent flyer program. I think it\u2019s far better and more popular. We have been aggressive in optimizing our route structure. So one thing that is really culminating here in 2014 is we\u2019ve gotten rid of underperforming routes and we redeployed airplanes to better routes that clearly is a benefit here.","The economy, at least in our view, has been more consistent, more stable, driving more confidence and more consistent travel demand. That\u2019s showing up. The industry is not adding a lot of capacity as well. So supply demand obviously seems to be from an industry perspective and nice balance. We\u2019ve had very few fare increases this year. So we\u2019re trying very hard to hold the line on our own cost, pass those savings onto our customers. We want to be America\u2019s low fare airline. And we had fare increase last week of a couple of bucks and that was, in my opinion, to cover the increase in the TSA tax.","So if you don\u2019t like that you can raise your congressman on that one. But overall, it\u2019s been a healthy travel environment with a healthy economy and I think superb route management by our folks. I think just all the way around, our folks are doing a great job. I am proud that bags fly free \u2013 I can\u2019t say it, but I am proud of it and no change fees. I think that make sure a very strong brand promise to our customers and break the load factors are also a result of that.","Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal","Okay, terrific, thanks and one quick follow-up. You guys can probably tell that newspaper editors love the word Ebola right now, so I have to ask for them, have you seen any effect at all as far as you can tell on the bookings from the concern of Ebola in the U.S.?","Gary C. Kelly","None, negative, nada. And Tammy mentioned that in her remarks earlier, so to make sure we\u2019re consistent.","Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly","And we have experienced with this in the past with other outbreaks and this is so few people have been effected in the United State, but in any of that giving you a straight answer to your question there is absolutely no evidence in any of our research that we\u2019ve seen an impact from it.","Jack Nicas \u2013 The Wall Street Journal","Okay thanks so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Terry Maxim with The Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxim \u2013 The Dallas Morning News","Good afternoon.","Gary C. Kelly","Good afternoon.","Terry Maxim \u2013 The Dallas Morning News","Could you elaborate on your comments on on-time? What sense do you think if you\u2019ve got the problem licked and kind of follow-up on your comments that that further adjustments that might happen in April. What are you looking at there?","Gary C. Kelly","Terry, the changes went into effect in early August. So I don\u2019t if August is such a clean month to try to analyze. If you move to September, we were hoping to get an on-time performance somewhere in the mid to high 80s and we ended up at 80%. I don\u2019t believe those numbers have been published yet Mike, but that\u2019s I am pretty sure Terry what you\u2019re ultimately see when the DOT report comes out. That was on phase to be closer to 85% probably 84%, but for the Chicago situation.","But 80% in September was the best performance of the year, it\u2019s good for September factoring and the problems we had in Chicago and we watch this on a daily basis, we compare our on-time performance to our peers. And based on all these evaluative technique, I feel very good that the schedule changes are effective. We planned to do more as I\u2019ve mentioned that I\u2019m really happy with the performance we\u2019re seeing, now. But Mike you\u2019ve had record load factor days here in October with stellar on-time performance, we\u2019ve had somehow OTP days of 90%, haven\u2019t we?","Michael G. Van De Ven","","That\u2019s right.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, so we haven\u2019t seen that while [Kery] (ph) and so it is obvious if the schedule changes are having a positive effect as within that.","Terry Maxim \u2013 The Dallas Morning News","","Okay, just a follow-up question I would like to ask about the Wright amendment. You are talking about the very high load factors. Do you have a feeling about how those loads will be once the statement goes into affect or the introductory fares go away, and you\u2019ve got your schedule fully up and we get into more normalized environment.","Gary C. Kelly","I will let Bob answer that. We do run higher load factors on our long-distance flights and Bob as, I think, you know lot about this question. If you look at the load factor, the last load factor I remember for our 800 fleet was almost 90%. So I\u2019m not going to be surprised if we continue to hover around 90% on a long-haul routes. Love is a constrained market as well with only 20 gates. So any thoughts there Bob.","","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, Terry, that\u2019s exactly right. Our longer haul flying tends to be in that 90% or sometimes 90% plus range. So you\u2019re going to have that added to Dallas just because of the flight mix is changing. We\u2019re making sure that we\u2019ve got really good fares, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019ve got plenty of local seats available too. So we want to manage our connections of Dallas, because Love Field is constrained. So we want plenty of room for our local Dallas customers and our new Dallas customers.","So to Gary\u2019s point I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we, because of the longer haul flying, because of the constrains on the airport, because of demand that we continue to see high load factors in Dallas, higher than the system.","Gary C. Kelly","But Terry, I would like to pile on here and compliment Bob and his team. We can analyze why it is, what it is, but we don\u2019t launch new routes and have this kind of performance. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job of managing the overall capacity of Dallas, so that you don\u2019t benefit one route and hurt others. They\u2019ve just done a masterful job. So some of the earlier questions that we had about our revenue trends whether Dallas is, and actually Dallas is performing exceptionally well. And I think that that is a large part due to the terrific design by our network planning folks.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with The Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Andrea Ahles \u2013 The Fort Worth Star-Telegram","","Thank you for taking my question. The sort of piggy bag now Terry was actually with the right men and you\u2019re seeing these load factors over 90% can you talk about that how operationally you\u2019re able to handle that? Is it impacting your on-time at all as you get ready to ramp and add even more flights into Love Field in November?","Gary C. Kelly","","Well, it\u2019s one of those where I feel like we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders. I think the commercial team has done a great job publishing the right routes with the right marketing support, the right revenue management support. And operationally Mike\u2019s team has known this was coming. The airport was ready. The airport construction was finished and it is beautiful and operating just like we had hoped. Mike, any other thoughts?","Michael G. Van De Ven","","No. I think you\u2019re right.","Gary C. Kelly","On-time performance has been exceptionally strong and\u2026","Michael G. Van De Ven","It\u2019s been good. At Dallas we factored all those in. We factored the 800 in. We\u2019ve got 10 times adjusted hopefully, appropriately for that and I feel like we\u2019re executing very well.","Gary C. Kelly","","Andrea, we\u2019ve had to add staff obviously for 22 digital flights, but all that was well done and all the folks are trained, glad to be there and it\u2019s just going really, really well. I\u2019m very proud of everybody.","Andrea Ahles \u2013 The Fort Worth Star-Telegram","So you\u2019re not seeing any sort of impact on your on-time performance out of Love with the longer turn times?","Gary C. Kelly","No. No, Andrea, the on-time performance this month is after Chicago was back up and running, which just happened to be the same day that the Wright amendment launched, our on-time performance on a daily basis has been really, really good.","Andrea Ahles \u2013 The Fort Worth Star-Telegram","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press.","David Koenig \u2013 The Associated Press","Hi, folks. Gary, in response to one of the analyst\u2019s questions about hedging, you said that fuel volatility is working for you now, but might not in the future. So you have to consider that. I wondered, what about fuel volatility in fares? We\u2019ve had this big drop in crude oil and jet fuel prices since about April, I guess. Should passengers expect to see that passed along to see that show up in lower fares?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, it\u2019s a meaningful part of the cost structure. I think the biggest problem for us now, when we get into a period like this is what\u2019s going to happen next. You remember 1999, crude oil, I think was down to $10 a barrel only to be followed with increases every single year for the next decade. It was just an unrepresented spike that took place. So that\u2019s what worries me in an environment like this is what are the unintended consequences that flow from this. So, that\u2019s said a different way. There\u2019s no way that we can count on $80 crude oil going forward. I\u2019m not willing to do that.","So we\u2019ll do our best to hedge and capture the best pricing that we can for our jet fuel purchases. And then for the first time since year 2000, we get our return on invested capital target, so I just hope that we continue in this. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re as an industry making money hand over fist. It\u2019s far from that. So we\u2019re finally realizing returns that one would expect from a high quality industrial company and I think we\u2019ll certainly celebrate the fact that the energy prices are lower than they otherwise would be no question of that.","David Koenig \u2013 The Associated Press","But couldn\u2019t you respond quickly enough if the prices doesn\u2019t stay at $80 and goes back to a $100 to $120, couldn\u2019t you just turnaround and lays fairs back up to what\u2019s going out?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, and you\u2019ve seen that and it doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m sure you heard my complaint earlier about the increase in the TSA tax. That Bob Jordan and our revenue management folks are concerned about trying to pass that along. We would always see an impact from increasing fares. So whether it is ultimately revenue positive is a question of the strength of the demand at the time and many times it\u2019s not very productive.","So, I mean, if you go back to 2008, there was a very sharp spike in energy prices, all carriers tried to raise fares, five went bankrupt that aren\u2019t here anymore. So no, the answer is absolutely not. You can\u2019t count on that. So that\u2019s a different way what I would not want to do to customers is take them through the same volatile ride with fares, lowered in one day, raised in the next day, I think that that would be absolutely the worst thing that we could do when we have absolutely no plan to do that.","David Koenig \u2013 The Associated Press","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from (indiscernible).","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much. To clarify these comments, are you locking in today\u2019s few prices under call options or you waiting to see if prices continue to fall for jet fuel?","Gary C. Kelly","I just didn\u2019t hear the first part of your question if you don\u2019t mind in repeating it.","Unidentified Analyst","Of course, are you locking in today\u2019s fuel prices under call options or are you going to wait for price to fall more before creating new hedge contract.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, let me let Tammy to answer that. The short answer is no we\u2019re not. We don\u2019t lock-in prices but let me let Tammy at least explain a little bit about our hedging.","Tammy Romo","","Yes on just for 2015, we\u2019re currently about 40% hedge for 2014. And that\u2019s really been online with where we\u2019ve been for 2015 for quite some time. So we\u2019ve got positions out through 2018, they were 40% hedged. And on 2015, 2016, 2017 and then we have about a 5% position out in 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Gary C. Kelly","And with those positions we don\u2019t actually lock the price. We buy options that would cap the price. So more prices it does provide an opportunity for us buy more and obviously Tammy and her team will work and think about that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay great thank you. And one other question would you be able to specify guidance for total revenue and perhaps operating margin numerically for the entire fourth quarter rather than month to month?","Gary C. Kelly","I guess the short answer, that is no. We\u2019ve given guidance here on October but the trends at least so far look good.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Sasso with Bloomberg News","Michael Sasso \u2013 Bloomberg News","Hi, good afternoon.","Gary C. Kelly","Hi.","Michael Sasso \u2013 Bloomberg News","Given the JetBlue had a earlier sided some overcapacity, or falling yields in Latin America. And I guess the question is that you mentioned earlier that your international operations were kind of weighing on your results. So can you quantify, just talk about, is over capacity or falling yields in Latin America weighing on, how much is that weighing on your results if anything?","Gary C. Kelly","Thank you and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify a little bit. The conversion from AirTran of Southwest adds more flights in the former AirTran markets, and number one. Number two, it also adds, we\u2019re also not fully connected to all of the Southwest Airlines route network, because we were facing in those flights to all of our locations gradually. So, for example, while we might have a nonstop flight from Baltimore to the Caribbean, if a customer was originating in Rochester, New York, they might not be able to get an international itinerary yet, whereas in the future they will.","So we are facing in our international operations gradually and right now the financial performance isn\u2019t what one would expect once those markets are mature. There is nothing unusual about this. There is nothing unexpected. It\u2019s a brand new venture for us. It really has nothing in other words to do with macro issues or whether there is too much supply or too little supply. Those routes were performing very well on AirTran and I expect by this time next year, they will be performing very well on Southwest Airlines. With respect to your broader question \u2013 so that\u2019s what\u2019s going on within Southwest in other words.","So that is simply a transition effort that we\u2019ve got to work through and we\u2019re working through it very well and I have every confidence that we\u2019ll be where we need to be this time next year. Now with respect to whether there is too much capacity or concerns about us adding more flights, not on the routes that we\u2019ve selected.","So I mentioned that we\u2019ll be serving Costa Rica. We\u2019ve announced service between Baltimore\/Washington and San Jose, Costa Rica beginning March 7 that as one flight a day each way. We are very confident that that flight will perform very, very well. So we don\u2019t have a large amount of Southwest capacity in international. We don\u2019t plan to have a lot more next year. So, none of these are concerns that we would share at Southwest.","Operator","","And we have time for one final question. Today, we\u2019ll take our last question from (indiscernible) with Flightglobal.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, you mentioned just now that you plan to be adding a handful of international destinations this year. Most of this is going to be from Houston-Aruba? Or are you looking at elsewhere?","Gary C. Kelly","","Well, we haven\u2019t said yet, but clearly we do plan to launch service when the terminal is ready in Houston and so we\u2019ll just need to stay tuned on that. But the handful really means probably three or four more new cities for Southwest Airlines service next year. So we\u2019re excited about that. It won\u2019t attract a lot of flights. It won\u2019t be a lot of incremental capacity with obviously you\u2019ll be \u2013 what we hope will be some exciting new destinations, so stay tuned.","Operator","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda B. Rutherford","Thanks Tom. We appreciate you all being with us. If you have any follow-up questions, the media can reach us at SWAmedia.com or through our direct line at 214-792-4847. Thanks so much.","Operator","","And, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining."],"19629":["Southwest Airlines Co.

My name is Laurie and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on the southwest.com Investor Relations section.","And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Martinez - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Laurie, and I want to welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today, we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. I'm sure you've seen our earnings release this morning and on today's call we'll share more insights about our second quarter performance, as well as our outlook, and then open it up for questions.","Before we get started, please note that we will make reference to forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current intent, expectations, and projections, and a variety of factors could cause our actual results to be materially different.

These results exclude special items, so please reference the Investor Relations section of southwest.com to find this morning's press release and our SEC filings for more information regarding both forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP results.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning everybody and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Mike Van de Ven, our Chief Operating Officer, has also joined us and you will be hearing from Tom, Mike, and Tammy, so I'm going to be very brief.","Given the challenges in the quarter, our people did an exceptional job and produced exceptional results, and I am very grateful to them, I'm very grateful for them and, just at the outset, I really want to thank them. I'm very proud of what our people produced.","We produced record earnings per share. From what I've seen, Southwest produced the strongest operating and net margins in the domestic industry, and that is despite our second quarter challenges. We benefited from federal income tax reform, but even that wasn't quite enough to offset the fuel price increases. But once again our people did a great job, as we were under-budget in virtually every other cost category.","It feels like the business effects of the April accident are behind us. Our folks did a tremendous job of regenerating booking momentum; close-in yields are strong. We're recovering strongly in third quarter relative to the second quarter, and especially if you take into account the increasing stage length and aircraft gauge.","Fourth quarter bookings are also strong, although it's still a good ways out, and the nice thing is that fourth quarter has no headwinds, aside from the usual economic or competitive issues. I want to personally thank Tom and Mike and Tammy for their stellar and steady leadership.","And at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Tom to provide an overview of the business, and Mike is going to cover operations, and Tammy is going to wrap it up with cost and financial recap. So, Tom, over to you, sir.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everybody. Well, as you know, and Gary has covered some of this, our second quarter got off to a very tough start. Having said that, though, our teams did work very hard and they fought through a lot of uncertainty.","We ended quarter with record operating revenues of $5.7 billion, which is up slightly year-over-year. Our second quarter RASM decreased 3% from last year, which is right in line with our guidance, and our load factor was down about 1 point from last year at 84.7%. But even with a decline in our load factor, we carried over 35 million revenue passengers in the quarter, which, by the way, did record number of customers for Southwest for any quarter.","The revenue impact of Flight 1380 was 2 points of RASM, which is roughly a $100 million reduction in passenger revenues. We re-launched our broader marketing efforts, including full digital and television, with our May 15 summer travel fare sale. And at this point, I'd say that our marketing is fully back to normal.","As you know, a fare sale for summer travel is very, very unusual for us, but the sole purpose was to get back in front of our customers, get traffic back to southwest.com, and re-stimulate bookings at attractive price points to make up for some of the lost ground, and we did that. The sale was very targeted driving travel in June through October, and it focused primarily on Tuesday and Wednesday travel, and we're very careful to preserve close-in yield opportunities with a 21-day advance purchase requirement. And the sale worked just as designed and it did help stabilize our passenger revenue trends.","Our yields for the second quarter were down 2.5%, but we saw this begin to stabilize in late May. And over the past two months, we've seen our yields strengthen considerably, and I'll talk more about that in just a moment. And, of course, our revenue management team, well, they did an incredible job and they delivered incredible results under a very, very difficult set of circumstances. I do want to thank you guys. I suspect you're listening to the call and thank you for that.","We did see very meaningful revenue benefits in the second quarter from our O&D revenue management systems, or bid pricing as it's called, and that was a key driver of our $35 million res system benefit in the second quarter. We're also using an array of other pricing techniques and tools behind the scenes. Our new res system is allowing us to manage our inventory and pricing with much greater granularity, and all these new capabilities are enabling us to better manage our low-fare offerings, in particular in competitive markets.","In terms of our ancillary revenue performance, we had a really good quarter. Our EarlyBird product had another strong performance in Q2, as did our upgraded boarding product, both of which were up strong double digits year-over-year, despite a slightly lower load factor. I'm also very pleased with the strength and growth of our Rapid Rewards Program, which is outpacing our capacity growth. And we're also very pleased with our business partner revenues. The combination of these two things were the primary drivers of the 10.4% increase of the revenues.","And our credit card portfolio also continues to perform well and growth in new card members and credit card spend were both up double digits for the quarter. And, of course, we continue to see great traction in growing our West Coast Rapid Rewards members and cardholder base, which aligns very nicely with our entry into Hawaii. And as you're probably aware, we launched a new credit card last week and that strengthens our frequent flier program even more.","On our last call, I talked about the impact that our sub-optimal schedule had on RASM due to increased shoulder flying. And as expected, this was about a 1 point drag on our Q2 RASM. You'll see this begin to recede in Q3 as our fleet builds back up to nearly pre-Classic retirement levels. So when you net out the temporary items, the 2 point RASM impact from Flight 1380 and the 1 point impact from the sub-optimal schedule, I feel very good about the underlying strength of the business and how we've rebounded since April 17.","Let's now talk about third quarter. So we expect our third quarter RASM to be in the range of flat to up or down 1% year-over-year. So let me start off with a few moving parts in Q3 that I want to talk through before reporting on our base business trends.","First and foremost, again, we are very pleased with the performance of our commercial initiatives that were enabled by our new reservation system and we remain confident in our plan to deliver $200 million in EBIT value this year on new reservation system. For Q3, we expect a $70 million to $80 million benefit, the majority of which is driven primarily by improved O&D revenue management, and this equates to a 1.5 point benefit to third quarter RASM.","Second, as you might expect, the summer travel fare sale had an overall dilutive impact to yield, overall (8:43) booking curve and we estimate that it will negatively impact third quarter revenue by $30 million, or a little more than 0.5 point of third quarter RASM. The good news here is that we don't see any material revenue impact from 1380 beyond Q3. We're continuing to see very positive signs of our recovery and a continued strength of the Southwest brand.","Third, our flight schedule in Q3 is still somewhat suboptimal, but the headwinds begin to subside in August as the percentage of shoulder flying begins to decrease as we overcome our fleet deficit. The schedule impact in Q3 improved sequentially from Q2, but is still about 0.5 point drag on Q3 RASM, and this penalty should subside wholly by Q4.","Finally, in our March 8-K filing, we called out that we needed to recast some prior period items to reflect several accounting changes, one of which was specifically related to our Rapid Rewards Program. The primary changes that we now account for are loyalty points at fair market value rather than incremental cost, and the net effect of this was an increase to our third quarter 2017 RASM and this creates a 1 point year-over-year RASM headwind to our third quarter for this year. This is purely for accounting purposes and the impact is largely isolated to Q3.","So we have several moving parts here in Q3, but when you adjust for the onetime items, the summer fare sale, the sub-optimal schedule, and the accounting adjustment, we feel very good about the strength of our base business. We are, in fact, seeing sequential yield improvements in the third quarter and we're seeing very good momentum with close-in yields, in particular in June and July.","Although the higher yields will put some pressure on our load factor, we're seeing solid demand across the booking curve and we're seeing particular strength in close-in demand. And as we announced in June, we've taken action on the capacity side as well and we've reduced our fourth quarter capacity plan by 2 points. We're also continuing to take aircraft deliveries and we'll be out of our fleet deficit position by the end of the third quarter. And finally, we continued to prepare for our launch of Hawaii service and our ETOPS work continues to be on track, and we're ready to serve Hawaii once we receive the necessary approvals.","And lastly, I'd like to share just a few thoughts on the fourth quarter as well. And you all know this, but we've been working through a lot of headwinds, onetime headwinds, over the past two quarters, second and third quarters, and Flight 1380 and suboptimal schedule and fleet deficits, it's been difficult and it's been challenging, but we have produced very, very solid results.","Looking forward to the fourth quarter, I'm really excited about the fourth quarter, because it will be a clean comparison. Our fleet deficit issues go away. The sub-optimized schedule goes away. The effect of 1380 will be largely behind us, and the momentum that we are feeling is real and it's tangible and it's building.","I feel very good about what we're seeing in terms of the business trends. We're seeing solid demand. We're seeing strength in yields and the quality of our schedule continues to improve. So having said that, our focus, of course, is to ensure that we bring in a very strong third and fourth quarter.","And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Mike.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thanks, Tom. Well, as you all know, the operation really picks up steam in the second quarter as summer travel gets into full swing. And we operate over 4,000 weekday flights during the quarter and we carry almost 400,000 customers a day over the period, so that's all Southwest Airlines. We don't spread any of that over partners or regional providers, and I don't believe any other carrier alone comes close to that kind of volume. So I am very proud of our team, our people, our frontline. They are warriors out there. They care about our customers. They care about each other. And there were certainly strong headwinds that they had to lean into to deliver a very solid operating performance in the second quarter.","Of course, Tom's already mentioned that the primary headwind was the acceleration of our fan blade inspection program. So we accelerated our program prior to issuance of any mandatory inspection protocols, and we completed inspections on about 17,000 fan blades in 30 days. We also in May had 17 aircraft out of service for about a week as a result of a really freak hailstorm over a small section of our gate area in Denver.","So both of those items reduced the amount of aircraft we had available to fly for scheduled service. And that, plus really the normal summer of thunderstorms, put us in operational recovery mode for really a large part of the second quarter. And despite all those headwinds, our on-time performance improved about 0.5 point from last year. So we had about 77% of our flights arrive within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival, and that's a little lower than what I would like, but it's closer to about 81% within 20 minutes. So even with all of those unexpected challenges, we didn't really suffer from lengthy delays.","The bag handling for the second quarter was the best in our history, and roughly 99.7% of our bags were flying on the flights that they were tagged to be on. And by the way, that's a complementary free of charge service from Southwest Airlines. We also had the lowest ratio of customer complaints from the DOT this year as compared to the same timeframe in 2017. And just as a reminder, we were the best in the industry in 2017, so again improvements in that area.","So my point is that despite very challenging operational headwinds, our people delivered a solid travel experience for our customers, and they did that with a very respectable cost performance for the quarter. Our ETOPS certifications, as Tom mentioned, are progressing. We have our application filed with the FAA and it's under review. We are flying domestic simulation flights using our proposed processes, and we're working with the FAA to amend and adjust those processes as are necessary.","And once our procedures are approved, we can begin our training programs, work toward validation flights, and all of those things require a tremendous amount of work and coordination between Southwest Airlines and the FAA, and both of our engagement teams are working hard together every day. So we've previously announced our U.S. gateway cities of San Diego, Oakland, San Jose, and Sacramento, and Hawaii destinations of Lihue and Maui and Honolulu and Kona, and we just remain focused on that effort.","So with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Right. Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Moving right into cost, I am pleased with our second quarter unit cost performance. Our CASM ex-special items was up only 1.5% year-over-year, with the biggest driver, of course, being higher fuel. Our economic fuel price per gallon increased 11% year-over-year to $2.21, which was in-line with our guidance. This included about $0.02 net benefit from hedging gains of $0.08, offset by $0.06 of fuel hedge premium costs.","For third quarter, based on market prices last Friday and given our hedging positions, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.25. Similar to second quarter, this includes an estimated $0.07 hedging gain and $0.06 of fuel hedge premium costs. While we're never happy about higher fuel prices, the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives over the past few years has us well prepared for the 40% year-over-year increase in market prices.","With hedging losses well behind us and a strong hedge in place for this year, as well as next, we are well-positioned to manage through fuel price headwinds. At current levels, we are recognizing modest net hedging gains and, as a reminder, our fuel hedge kicks in more significantly at Brent crude prices $80 per barrel and above.","So, I feel very good about our fuel hedge portfolio. We have meaningful protection as prices move up and will move down with the market as crude prices decline. I'm also pleased with our continued fuel efficiency gains from fleet modernization, including the retirement of our Classics. Our second quarter available seat mile per gallon, our key fuel efficiency metric improved by 1.7% year-over-year. Through the first half of the year, our fuel efficiency improvement is slightly trailing our 2018 goal of 2% to 3%, primarily due to our utilization of the 700s to cover our fleet deficit and sub-optimal flight schedule. I expect to see momentum in our fuel efficiency as our schedule becomes more optimized in fourth quarter and beyond, coupled with the increasing mix of MAX aircraft in our fleet.","Excluding fuel, our second quarter cost performance was better than expected, primarily due to timing. Our unit cost, excluding fuel, special items, and profitsharing, was up only 0.4% year-over-year versus our guidance of 1% to 2%. This was largely due to costs shifting into the second half of this year and in total, about $30 million shifted from first half into second half, primarily in the areas of advertising and technology.","We also have had some second half cost inflation that is driven by the timing of events and spend. And for third quarter, our unit cost inflation includes a heavy concentration of advertising. Part of it was planned, as we discussed, related to Flight 1380 and in addition, year-over-year trends will be impacted by lower advertising last year third quarter, resulting from the pullback in advertising following the hurricanes and natural disasters.","Maintenance expense is also expected to be higher year-over-year due to timing of heavy maintenance events. And we continue to see a higher mix of operating expense versus capitalization with our technology spend. With all that in mind, we currently expect our third quarter unit costs, excluding fuel, special items, and profitsharing, to increase in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year.","Looking ahead to fourth quarter, we also have some inflationary year-over-year pressures relative to first half 2018 trends, particularly in depreciation as we lap the Classic retirements and continue investing in the fleet. Also, as you think ahead to fourth quarter, keep in mind, we'll have some incremental unit cost pressure from our recent reduction in fourth quarter year-over-year ASM growth, as it is difficult to shed a similar level of fixed costs overnight.","As such, our full year 2018 CASM, excluding fuel, special items, and profitsharing, is now expected to be flat to up 1% year-over-year. This is more inflation than I would like and we will certainly strive to drive efficiency and productivity. And as a quick reminder again, this guidance does include our tentative agreement with AMFA.","Before I move along to the balance sheet and cash flow, I also want to thank our people for their continued efforts and diligence to efficiently and effectively control our costs, especially in a rising fuel price environment.","As we have communicated to you all many times, maintaining an investment-grade and very strong balance sheet is among our top priorities, and we continue to have a balanced approach to managing our capital. Our liquidity remains very strong. Second quarter operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, with free cash flow at $1.1 billion. There was no change to our full year CapEx guidance, which remains in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range this year, with $1.2 billion of that for aircraft.","During the first half of the year, we executed $1 billion in share repurchases. This includes the $500 million accelerated share repurchase we launched at the end of April, which will be completed no later than the end of this month. And this leaves $350 million remaining under our $2 billion authorization. And as you will probably recall, in May our board of directors approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, and our board substantially increased our quarterly dividend 28% to $0.16 per share, or $0.64 annually.","This builds up on the significant value we've returned to shareholders, which over the past five years we've returned nearly all of our free cash flow through share repurchases and dividends. And we intend to maintain our balanced approach to capital deployment with the continued focus on profitably growing our business and strong returns above our cost of capital.","I will close out with a quick recap of our fleet and capacity. We took delivery of 12 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and two MAX 8s in the quarter, bringing our total fleet count to 730. And we expect to end the year at 751 aircraft. And we continue to plan for our 2018 capacity to increase in the low 4% range, with third quarter up in the 4.5% to 5% range and fourth quarter up in the 6.5% to 7% range year-over-year. And as Tom mentioned, we are on track with our ETOPS work to hopefully begin selling Hawaii service this year.","Lastly, we currently have 30 firm aircraft deliveries in 2019 and our current plan is to earmark some of our 737-700 aircraft for retirement next year, as we continue to invest in fleet modernization. We continue to have tremendous flexibility in our order book and fleet, which will serve us well in any environment.","In summary, we had a solid second quarter, record second quarter earnings per share, and we generated what we expect to be industry-leading margins and high returns on invested capital, despite higher fuel costs and our second quarter challenges. Our employees performed magnificently and I am proud of what we accomplished together. The recent strength in yields is encouraging and we are focused on reliable, efficient operations as we work diligently to control our costs. And I'm pleased with the returns we are seeing from these significant investments we've made on fleet modernization, our new reservation system, and our Rapid Rewards Program, as well as overall strength of our network.","We have ample liquidity and we continue to return significant value to our shareholders, while continuing to invest in our people and our business. To reiterate, we are focused on revenue generation and prudent cost control to deliver healthy margins and shareholder returns.","With that, Laurie, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Music] (00:24:55-00:25:16) And we will take our first question today from Jack Atkins at Stephens. Please go ahead, sir.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Good afternoon, guys. How are you all doing?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","We're doing fantastic. Thank you.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Well, thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess, first off for either Gary or Tom or maybe both if you'd like to expand on it, just the tone of your prepared comments was very constructive with regard to the momentum that you're seeing in your business. I would just be curious to know, is this macro related? Is this due to the flexibility in the tools that you're seeing sort of playing out from the new reservation system? I would just like for you to expand on that for a moment, because it certainly sounds like the business, as you look out into the fourth quarter, could be heading toward inflection and profitability.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I'll start and Tom will clean it up. But I do think that we are in an environment, here in 2018, where the economy is very strong. It's growing and travel demand reflects that. We have improved our revenue-producing capability significantly over the past \u2013 oh, call it \u2013 seven years and are in the midst now, of course, of taking, I hope, a leg up again. We had some, obviously, well-covered disruptions here in the second quarter.","But I think, Jack, most of the things that we're reporting to you are micro, not macro. And no doubt, our competitors benefited from some of our issues in the second quarter and I expect that we will claw that back, and that's happening here. But aside from the \u2013 I don't know how you think about it, whether it's micro or macro, when you get down to the industry level, it's still a very competitive industry and the industry collectively is growing, and that means we're facing more competitive capacity as time goes by.","But I think most of what Tom is reporting today is mostly unique to Southwest and our execution, working through some challenges. And again, I know we've said it repeatedly, but I think everyone here has done a marvelous job of responding to an unexpected challenge and getting through that. And now I think we've got a lot to look forward to, in addition to planned activities that we're rolling out in 2018.","So the nice thing is, we're seeing the results we hoped for and we have more to come. And I'll just put in a little teaser that we have the benefits flowing from our new reservation system, which are well-known and well-covered, and now we need to deliver. And again, Tom's report was we're pretty much on track with that and now we're beginning to work on a portfolio of new ideas that will flow in the future. It's not going to be fourth quarter. It may not even be in 2019, but we need to keep this pipeline full and I'm very confident that our folks will continue to do that.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","I guess, the only thing I'd add, Jack, is just to kind of jump out of that, I think the execution, both the operational execution that Mike talked about and the frontline execution is outstanding. I think that one thing I didn't hit on in my comments that I think is important \u2013 and I think this is kind of a macro thing \u2013 our marketing kicked back in in a very, very big way. It was really highly effective in driving demand back to our website and even bookings.","I think that as we drive more demand to the site and the new capabilities that Andrew and the commercial side of the house have around yield management, pricing management techniques and tools, we're starting to really monetize those things. And I think it's really valuable and it's really important, and it gives us a level of granularity we've just never had before. We're seeing it come to fruition, so I think that contributes a lot to it.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's a very helpful answer. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up to that, Tom, kind of going back to your comments on the reservation system benefits that you realized in the second quarter that you anticipate realizing in the third quarter. Am I right with that math to assume that leaves about $90 million or so that's left to be realized in the fourth quarter? And if I'm not right, could you kind of give us a correct number on that? And then, is all that expected to flow through on the revenue side, or will that come in other places on the P&L?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, you're probably very close. I'm not sure exactly if it's $90 but you're not out of the ballpark. I'm sorry. What was the other part of your question, Jack? Is all going to flow through...","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Well, $90 million or so roughly, is that going to be on the revenue side, or is that going to flow through other places on the P&L?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, it'll be predominantly on the revenue side.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","We'll go next to Hunter Keay at Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everybody. Thank you so much. I was hoping you might talk at the very least qualitatively about how you're thinking about your capacity growth, given that I think you've loaded your schedule for the first, whatever it is, nine weeks of 2019. It's showing sub 3% growth. I'm pretty sure you haven't loaded Hawaii in there, so that's probably going to be incremental. But when we think about the year as a whole and some of the wonky stuff that we're going to be lapping in the back half of 2019, how are you guys thinking about maybe like a core growth rate for the year on a system ASM basis?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I'll start here. We're at a pace to grow in the low 4% range this year. That's down from what I had planned for us for the year. I don't think that we'll grow over 5% next year. That, again, is what we had planned initially for 2018, so it would be something less than that. But we haven't fully baked the year and, yeah, you should \u2013 but, Hunter, the point you're making is a good one, which is you should not assume based on what you've seen there for the first part of 2019 that that is our growth rate for the year. I certainly agree with that.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. Okay. And then when you guys have said in the past that you won't fly a route that isn't profitable, how are you defining that term?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Revenues minus expenses.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So is it operating expenses or is it the marginal cost of operating that extra flight, or is it all-in expenses including aircraft ownership?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Fully allocated.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Always fully allocated?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Of course.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So now markets take time to mature and we have a set of very mature markets that are well into the profitability range. And we have start-up markets that sometimes will take several years before they reach the kind of maturity that we're satisfied with. But I'll tell you this. Once we decide to put Southwest in a market, we are loathe to pull out. So we have the overall cost structure and operating margins and balance sheet to be patient, and there are a thousand city pair examples over the years that would support that patience.","A lot of our competitors, of course, will go in, they pull out, and we're just not going to do that. But wherever we decide to go, it is with, obviously, an eye towards success, which means absolutely fully allocated profitability, of course. We can't achieve the kind of results that we have unless we have a philosophy like that, so I'm not sure I understand the question.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you, Gary.","Operator","And hi, sir. Please check your mute button.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Who?","Operator","Jamie Baker.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Ah, well, there you go.","Operator","Yay.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Gary, at the industry level, the competition is finally beginning to emphasize the goal of achieving higher margins next year. And that's a welcome change since the industry margins have been down for, I guess, three years now. But by the looks of consensus and certainly my own model, it seems that \u2013 I mean, it's basically a layup that Southwest has higher margins next year. I'm not asking you to endorse this. Rather, can you identify anything, any sort of headwind, that would be specific to Southwest that might interfere with the process of expanding margins? I guess I'm asking you to kind of play your own devil's advocate here.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, while I appreciate the complement there and we're very confident and I think our folks have the track record to demonstrate, I did have to chuckle at your report this morning. You know you left the H out of Southwest there.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","We've already taken heat for that. Oh, man.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I just mainly want you to know that I read your stuff. But the other thing that I...","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, it was a test. You passed.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, the other thing that I noted is that you referred to one of our competitor's historic statement of this is not a hobby. Back to the previous question, it has never been a hobby at Southwest and we have a very long track record of producing. So as we think about the risk associated with next year in light of your question, I wish I could agree with you that thinking about a year is a layup, because it's just a tough business. Things happen. And they just have to be managed and we need to plan and manage the company in such a way that we could absorb the unexpected.","And that's why it's important, far from this being a hobby, you have to have a strong balance sheet, you have to have strong profit margin, so you can absorb the kind of unexpected blows that no doubt will come up. It could be higher fuel prices next year. It could be a recession. It could be undesired, back to Tammy's comment, complaint about our \u2013 even the modest cost pressures that we're seeing here in the second half, it could be unexpected cost pressures. So all of that has to be managed and there's just tremendous operating leverage in an airline, because of all the high fixed costs. So all that just needs to be balanced accordingly.","Now, understanding we're in the business to take a risk as we assess the outlook for 2019, I agree with you. I think that the economy looks pretty good. I'm not overly concerned about fuel price increases from here. Tammy's pointed out, I think, very well how well our hedge is positioned. We have very modest levels of debt. We don't have any significant debt financing requirements. And we have new equipment coming in next year, which is 100% MAX.","This year, obviously, we're getting a blend of some NGs, as well as MAX. So it's a pretty good setup for next year. We'll need to manage our expansion and it will be Hawaii. And then secondly, we need to manage the execution of various initiatives we have under way and our spending there, and then just our overall cost. So, as I've put in the press release in my comment, I want more of a focus of our company on the operating cost as a priority than what it has been over the last 5 to 10 years, simply because we had higher priorities.","We needed to transform Southwest, which our folks have done. So I would just \u2013 hopefully that's responsive to your question.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","We never ever approach a year as if it is a layup. That's, quite frankly, when you get into trouble. But even in a year like this one, we're having a few unexpected challenges, our folks are doing extraordinarily well. So I think we'll be very well-positioned and I think, once again, I believe we'll have a really good 2019.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Excellent. And as a follow-up to that, Gary, you did mention in passing, I think it was new ideas that will flow in the future as it relates back to some of your newfound capabilities. Can you opine on that at all? Are you talking about possible product initiatives that you're considering, something that might alter the in-flight experience? Is it something that might impact boarding? Is it something about distribution? I'm sure it's accretive in your model. I'm just wondering what part of the either booking process or flight process it might impact. Not looking for specifics, just where might this manifest.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I don't think we need to change the essence of what Southwest Airlines is to still find opportunities to drive revenues. And I think the way you \u2013 it's not ready for primetime, although we are looking at the prioritization of our initiatives over the next three years to see how we might want to fit some new ideas in. The main reason I wanted to bring it up today is, we've had a good flow of initiatives over the last 5 to 10 years, and they have served us well. And we have not mentioned what's next and what is beyond our new reservation system, and we're in the midst of executing that.","And I think that there's \u2013 fortunately, I think that there are a lot more opportunities and when they're ready for primetime, we'll share them. So it is mainly just to let our investors know that we're not sitting idly by and counting on the initiatives that you know of, that now it is time for us to get busy on the next stream, and I would expect that in the not too distant future that Tammy and Ryan would be in a position to begin unveiling those.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's excellent, Gary. I can assure you we'll fine-tune our spellchecker as well. Take care.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","All right, sir.","Operator","And we'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Hi.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Tom, you made some fairly constructive comments about 3Q and what it's implying about 4Q based on forward bookings, et cetera, and it seems like you've got a nice acceleration coming as you move ahead. But what am I missing in that thinking? Are there any headwinds that we should be aware of as we start looking at the next quarter? Because, obviously, it seems to be a bit of an anomaly this quarter with all the various things you pointed out.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. I think there are anomalies in the third quarter that we already talked about. But, again, just kind of back to the base trends we're seeing, strengthening since late May, early June, into July in terms of shopping, pricing, close-in strong, further-out strong. So we're feeling pretty good about where we are. We're only published through February of the fourth quarter, obviously. So where we are in the curve is very, very early, but we do feel pretty bullish about where we are in the third quarter.","I think that we are saying flat to plus or minus 1%, and I think we have a real shot on the revenue side, right? But we have a lot of work to do. And where that goes in the fourth quarter, there's nothing that myself or the team is looking at that says, boy, there's something very foreboding in front of us. We aren't seeing that. I think as trends, if they're going to carry on as they are, I think you'll have a very nice third, fourth quarter, so we have a lot of work to do. Just as Gary said, there's no such thing as a layup here at all. So we have a lot of work to do, but that's probably how I would answer that, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And, Gary, in terms of just how you're approaching capacity here, in particular the implication of higher fuel, I mean, how is that impacting the way you're thinking about capacity? I know you've trimmed a little bit to stabilize sort of the RASM environment, but I guess the specific question is, how is higher oil impacting your thinking of the business, in particular capacity as you look forward?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, obviously, it can't be ignored. And I think the one thing that I've not talked about that I do want to just make the point in terms of how we're thinking about capacity is, we have invested a great deal in Southwest Airlines, and especially in recent years. And by definition, the investment means for the future, for future growth. We've just opened up a new training facility across the street from our headquarters. We've just acquired new flight training simulators. We're investing in airports across the country, and all of that creates overhead. And to not add capacity and absorb that would sub-optimize the investment that has been made in the company, which has been very, very necessary. So I would just ask you to also factor that in. A lot of operating leverage, a very heavy amount of fixed costs in our business, and you just leave a lot on the table if you don't fully take advantage of those investments.","Now, the concern that you have about higher fuel prices, that's why we hedge. That's why we think it is important to hedge. And I think that it's served us extremely well over the past generation in something that \u2013 as I think about the next generation in Southwest, I hope they always employ that kind of a risk management technique. But at the margin, higher fuel prices have to make us a little more circumspect about our expansion, and it probably causes us to take less risk with the additional flights that we add.","I think finally, if we do decide that we need to reduce capacity, we have more flexibility built into Southwest today than ever. Again, from a growth plan, it's not literally reducing the fleet, but we have more flexibility today than ever. And it just comes with a penalty, a unit cost penalty, because there'll be a lot of unabsorbed overhead, if you will. So all of that just needs to be balanced and right now my view for 2019 is that it is a year that looks very solid in terms of us thinking about expanding not more than 5%, as I mentioned to Hunter, but certainly it's a year that we feel like the risk\/reward is such that it argues in favor of continuing our expansion.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Gary.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Savi Syth at Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. Just a quick question on the fuel side. Tammy, you mentioned that hedging really kicks in about $80. Is that for 2019, too? And also connected to that, what's the portion of the $345 million that's related to 2019?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, hey, Savi. Yeah, it's similar. It's a similar story for 2019. We are 64% hedged for next year, so we're in good shape as well. So kind of a similar story. And as we get to $80 per barrel, we would see those hedges kick in more significantly.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Are you able to give the breakout of the fair market value that's kind of related to 2019 itself?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure. Yeah, let me pull that number for you here. If you'll give me one second, I'll give you the breakdown.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sure. And maybe, Tammy, while you're looking that, if I can ask a follow-up on kind of the unit revenue trend here. I was just wondering what the hurricane \u2013 is the hurricane a benefit to 3Q RASM look? What I'm really trying to get at is, as these overhangs come out, it sounds like you're comfortable with kind of getting back to that positive RASM trajectory, but I just wanted to clarify if I'm hearing that correctly.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, Savi, this is Tom. I think the way we look at that is probably about 0.5 point of upside for us.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","But that's all factored into Tom's...","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","That's already in.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","...flat plus or minus range, so we've got \u2013 as usual, there's just a lot of stuff in the stew. So there's pluses, there's minuses, and that is one. That is assuming, of course, we don't have a similar impact again this year, but that's what's implicit in there.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","That is one of the tailwinds that gets us to our current guidance.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And, Tom, do you \u2013 go ahead, Tammy.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Oh, go ahead. Finish your thought there, Savi.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I was just kind of curious, so, Tom, are you feeling comfortable that we can get to the positive RASM trajectories? Is that kind of the implication of some of the comments, or am I taking it too far?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I wouldn't \u2013 I'm not sure I'm ready to say that we're ready to commit to that. I do feel like the trends and what we're seeing are really, really solid. We feel good about that. And I think if we were to see things continue as \u2013 hey, listen. I think things are looking solid for us and they feel very good. I'm not ready to commit to positive RASM. But, boy, I'll tell you what, if you're wondering is that what we're shooting for, that's absolutely what we're shooting for is the execution towards positive RASM, and we're going after it hard. We're going after it in terms of pricing, in terms of the capacity, in terms of the schedule, in terms of several things, in terms of the marketing. So we're going after it. Things are blazing, but that's what we're shooting for. That's what we're working towards.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And, Savi, the only way I would try to answer your question, it's not different than what Tom is saying at all, but we know where we are today and we know where we've come from, and we're really happy about that. We have good line of sight to most of the third quarter and we're very happy with that. You know, like we do, that trying to forecast 60 days, much less 90 or 120 days out, it's just not accurate.","Clearly, one can logically put together a set of expectations that say second quarter turned out pretty good, all things considered. Third quarter, as of July 26, has shown notable improvement, which I would have expected, but you still have to go do it. And then the third quarter is hampered by a few things and those kind of burdens clear in the fourth quarter. So one would expect, I think, that fourth quarter is better yet again than the third quarter.","And, obviously, if we're talking flat to up or slightly up or down, logically then you would say, yeah, that means that fourth quarter is positive. So I think all those things ring true. It's just we're not ready to forecast that. We don't have enough information to do that, but we're very encouraged with the trends and I agree with the way Tom described it, which is we have palpable momentum and with a little bit of luck here, the momentum will continue to build.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","And I'll just chime in.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Appreciate it.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Savi, I'll just chime in, too, before I answer your fuel question. Just in terms of the trends from quarter-to-quarter, Tom walked you through all the noise with all the headwinds and tailwinds for third quarter, but I do think it's \u2013 we're excited again just to get to the fourth quarter where we have clean comparisons, and so that's a plus.","We're seeing great benefits from our new reservation system and what we're seeing in the business trends, again, just repeating what we said earlier, demand is very solid. And what's particularly encouraging is the strength that we're seeing in yields and particularly the close-in yields. So all that to say, we're excited to get these headwinds behind us and looking forward to the fourth quarter.","On your question on the breakdown, I believe it was on the fair market value of our hedge, so the roughly $185 million of that was 2019 and $112 million of that is 2020, and then the rest is split between 2021 and 2022.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Helane Becker at Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. When you guys were thinking about Hawaii and ETOPS certification, I know the FAA \u2013 I think this is a question for Mike \u2013 I know the FAA takes its time to do and it could take up to a year. But can you just say if where you are in the process of gaining approval is where you thought you would be six or nine months ago?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, Helane, we had set out a timeframe or a timeline, and what I would tell you is we're along that timeline. So what's important for us right now, so the FAA does have our manual procedures that we have defined. And what we're trying to do at this point in time is enough exercises to make sure that we have thought through all the different things that possibly could go wrong on a flight. It could be a mechanical issue; it could be customer illness on the flight; it could be headwinds; it could be a problem at the airport that you're landing in. And just making sure that the procedure that we have defined would anticipate and address those things, and that we're practiced at doing that . So that's the process that we're in right now.","And as we go through that, we'll have some comfort that, yeah, these procedures are well. So I would expect in the next 30 to 60 days, we will understand that these procedures are ready to go, and then we'll begin training and, hopefully, move onto a validation flight after that.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And then when we think about that training and so on, I'm sure, because that's your timeline, the costs are built into your guidance. But is that going to necessitate hiring additional head count to kind of fly the existing route network while you're going through that training process?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, and we've already accomplished all of that, so we've already understood that we're going to have a cadre for example of pilots that will go through some ETOPS training, that will pull them off of their normal flying responsibilities. And we've already adjusted our head count needs for that.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, perfect. Thanks very much.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And, Helane, I did want to \u2013 you didn't specifically ask about it, but just on the business of Hawaii, we have a long track record with our network planning group of predicting the success or failure, quite frankly, of new routes, additional frequencies, and so forth. So their forecast accuracy is quite amazing and, of course, you'd have to factor in the unknown, how will competitors react and so on. But just to repeat that the gateways, say, the four gateways from California to the four island destinations that we've selected, all forecast very well.","And then in addition to that, while the inter-island was not our initial vision, if you will, for our Hawaii service, once we were asked to look at that and once we took a good look at it with the way we would flow our aircraft, it also forecasted really well, so we're very enthused about that, how fast it will ramp-up, I think, remains to be seen, of course.","As we were talking earlier, nothing is ever a layup, but the work that Mike has been conducting has gone exceptionally well. And, I would say, just from my thumbnail sketch of it, we're right where we thought we would be, but there is still work remaining between now and the fall, and ultimately it's up to the FAA to decide whether they're going to give us the good housekeeping seal of approval here. But so far, that's gone really well.","And then on the business side of things, we are no less enthused. If anything, what I was trying to suggest is that as we've looked at more opportunities, we've gotten even more enthused about that. So it'll be our commercial focus here pretty soon and we're going to stick with it and we will succeed.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Thanks, Gary, and team, Tom, everybody. Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question and we'll take our last question from Duane Pfennigwerth at Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey. Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on a question that Jamie asked earlier, but maybe a little bit more specifically. Can you weigh in on potential move to assigned seating? For example, Ryanair sees half their customers pay to reserve a seat. That's value they see in sort of paying for. Nearly as many also pay up for priority boarding. In core Southwest markets, your customers know, appreciate, or at least understand your open seating. But in markets like New York, where you have less presence, it has to be costing you some share among corporates and leisure passengers. So can you give us some confirmation it's something you're actually looking at? How quickly could you be in a position to make the change? And was the res system a prerequisite to making that change? Thanks for taking the questions.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Great questions. Well, let me be very blunt. We are not looking at assigning seats right now. We're not talking about assigning seats now, and we're not talking about looking at it at some time in the future. Just trying to be very clear on your questions. On the points that you make \u2013 well, before I address that, the opportunities that we have to layer in some additional initiatives don't require assigned seating and they are very handsome opportunities. These are ideas. They're until \u2013 as my good friend Bob Jordan always says, it's an idea until it's a plan. And so we're in the midst of developing some plans. But it does not require assigned seating to pursue some really exciting opportunities I feel like we have.","Now, everything you said is true. There are absolutely customers who demand assigned seating. We do have examples around the world where carriers have gone to assigned seating. Assigned seating does open up an array of opportunities that we could think about. Tom, I think it probably is fair to say that the new reservation system at least puts us in a position where we can more realistically think about that. So I like being in a position where some day, if we decide to do it, we could evaluate assigned seating. And it ain't happening now and it won't happen next year. And why I would want to predict anything beyond 18 months, I don't know, so I won't.","But I think, Duane, all I wanted to allow is that \u2013 with our investors, is that look it's something that we could consider. There are pluses and minuses on balance to this point. In our Southwest life, we have concluded that we are better off with what we're doing today, and I still believe that by the way, but it doesn't mean that we can't come back and revisit that at some point in the future. But we don't need it right now.","And what I'm really excited about here in the near term are things that we don't get asked about as much or talk about as much, and it's all the things on the operations side that Mike Van de Ven has underway with a new maintenance record keeping system, a new flight following system, and just better communication capabilities for our operations employees, which should put us in a position to offer better customer service and be more efficient. Our folks are running a really great airline right now and it will only get better. And now, to be able to think about layering in some more new revenue initiatives is very exciting. And one of these days, we can cuss and discuss about assigned seating, but it's nothing that's happening right now.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","And, Gary, if I could just add to that. Duane, this is Tom. And what may surprise you is we actually did look at this \u2013 when was it, Gary, 2004, 2005?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Right.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","And not just looked at it. We actually flew real flights with real customers, real passengers, out of San Diego in I think it was 2005. So, I guess, the reason I bring that up is we are not so wed to things that we're not open to looking at new ideas, new ways of doing it. That actually proved to us that we could do it if we chose to. Our customers actually asked us not to. That was the interesting thing. It was actually the business travelers, interestingly enough. But that work did give results in the new boarding process.","I guess, my point is you get a derivative benefit of looking at new things. I agree with Gary completely. It is not on our punch list right now at all. We have much bigger things to get at. But I don't want you to think we are immutable in what our product is and we'll continue to make the product stronger. That's just not one of the things we're going to be working on.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Part of our current thinking is all the facts that you all know, which is if we're not the strongest brand in airlines, we are among the strongest brands, and that's with the product that we offer today, to Tom's point, about what our customers told us more than 10 years ago. And number two, doing it the way we do it, we've been the largest airline in the country for 15 years. So I don't like the saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but there's certainly no evidence that it's broken.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. Okay. We'll stay in suspense and thank you for the detailed response.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's analyst portion of the call. Thank you for joining us. And we will now begin with the media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications Officer.","Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Laurie, and welcome to members of the media to our call today. Before we start taking some questions, Laurie, could you give them some instructions on how to queue up to begin our Q&A session?","Operator","Certainly. [Music] (01:06:12-01:06:55) And we'll go first to Andrew Tangel at The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Hi, Southwest folks. Thanks for taking the question. A question about fuel costs and fares. How much more room do you all have to raise fares as you try to recoup these higher fuel costs? At what point do you see higher fares, higher than where they are now, scaring off customers and reducing demand? And right now we're in a time where consumers are paying a lot more for a lot of other products.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, thanks for the question. I would just want to get my factoids straight here, but the \u2013 first of all, we had a very solid second quarter. I think you're familiar with the challenges that we had, so despite the challenges. And during the quarter our fares were down year-over-year 4.4%. So despite the fact that fuel prices were up, we used savings from the tax reform to kind of fund that, if you will, and we didn't sock it to our customers. So we're America's low fare leader. We work hard to keep our fares low. And to the extent that fares go up at Southwest, we try to do that in, obviously, a modest and gradual way.","Obviously, if our overall costs go up, it puts pressure on us and we need to be compensated for our service and some things have to be passed along to the customer. But we're in good shape and we had a solid quarter. So we've got some \u2013 I think we'll have very good comparisons with our average fare levels this year versus last year. So I'm certainly not warning you or anybody that they need to be looking out for fare increases coming from Southwest. Doesn't mean we won't increase fares. I'm just saying that we're in good shape and right now you're not seeing overall fare increases.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Mind if I add to that...","(01:09:32)","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Andrew, this is Tom. Just a thought on that as well. I mean, we're pretty proud of the fact that we are a low fare leader. That's part of who we are, it's part of the brand. I think that as we get more sophisticated \u2013 I think you heard the rest of the call, as we get more sophisticated with some of our capabilities, we're going to have the ability to manage our pricing and our fares much more specifically.","And what I would hope for us to be able to do is to retain low fares without \u2013 just retain those low fares, but also drive our other fares up. What I mean by that is, if we could isolate low fares into certain parts of the day where you typically have lower demand, we could still make that low fare available for our customer, and then drive other demand into the meat of the day, where you'd like to try and get a little more yield. But I think it's very important, from my perspective, that we have the ability to maintain the low fare leadership, and that's going to require pricing tools, which is what's part of what we put in with our new res systems. So, low fares are important for Southwest Airlines and for our customers.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Okay. Yeah, just if you could at least address the thrust of the question, too, about how much more customers can bear at this point. Do you have room to raise fares if you needed to, to what extent, or at what point do you hit the limit of how much customers are willing to pay and you lose passenger traffic?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, and again, I think all I was trying to illustrate is that our fares are down and they're down every year since 2014, as I recall. So we're doing a good job of holding the line for our customers, and so I think by extension, because we have not been raising fares overall, I think one can understand that, no, we haven't, \"reached the limit.\" But I think the other thing I would in fairness to you and your question, is we don't talk about where we're going with our fares, and so I wasn't intending to hint to you what we might be doing tomorrow or six months from now. That's not appropriate and for competitive reasons also, we wouldn't want to do that. But that's what our behavior has been and that's where we were in the second quarter, and so hopefully that answers...","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on \u2013 it's sort of related, but also just something you were talking about earlier with additional revenue streams to diversify revenue streams. Your competitors have talked about how they're diversifying their revenue streams. You've all talked about it too. Specifically, are you looking at potentially adding bag fees, change fees, cancelation fees as you're trying to keep fares low and deal with these fuel costs?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I didn't offer anything specific. It was worse than generic. It was very obtuse and I know that. It's basically just to let folks know that we're working on it and enthused about some ideas that we have. However, to your question, the specific question you posed, we are not thinking about bag fees. We are not thinking about change fees.","Andrew Tangel - The Wall Street Journal","All right. Thanks. Appreciate it. I'll stop asking follow-up questions.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","They're all good. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Mary Schlangenstein at Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Hi. I have a question for Mike, please. Mike, what led to the decision for Southwest to step-up the inspections on your engine fan blades and do those more frequently?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, hey, Mary. How are you?","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Good. Thanks.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, as there have been industry inspections ongoing, and I believe those industry inspections are in their final stages, but I'm aware of maybe four or five additional industry findings. And based on those results, GE is contemplating a change in their lube and inspection intervals from something other than 3,000 cycles, and they've talked to us more about something in the 1,600 to 1,800 range. So, based on that, Mary, we just decided to make a proactive change to the intervals. And today our fleet is on a 1,600-cycle reinspection program.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay. So can you be any more specific in terms of what the findings were?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Other than that they were just \u2013 there are cracks in fan blades out there with respect to the industry, and I think that more frequent lubrications helped mitigate potentially that and moving that cycle down would slow the propagation rates down and just mitigate some of the risk.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Right. And were any of those additional cracks found on Southwest fan blades?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","What I'm talking about \u2013 I don't know on the GE. The four to five, I don't know.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","You don't know whose they were found on or you don't know if they were on Southwest?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Those four to five I was talking about were not found on Southwest.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Were not. Okay. Great. Excellent. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we do have time for one additional question. We'll take the last question from Dave Koenig at The Associated Press.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Hi. Good afternoon, guys and Tammy.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Hey, David.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Hello.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay. You answered questions about assigned seats, bag fees, and change fees. It strikes me you're not always the lowest price carrier on a lot of routes, and I wonder if you did have a premium cabin or you had premium seats, maybe you could subsidize lower fares in the back of the plane, or any ideas like that on your list for things that might be upcoming in the next few years?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","No, that's not in the basket of things that I was alluding to. Now, having said that, we can always think about the opportunity that you just described. I would kind of lump that in with assigned seating, and that's something that we could always do. But, Dave, we can't guarantee today, 20 years ago, 40 years ago, that every time you look for a fare, that we will be the lowest fare. We can't guarantee that. That's never been the case. The vast \u2013 I don't know if it's the vast majority. The majority of the time, Southwest will be the low fare and it's an easy claim to make if you include the bag fees and change fees, and that's something that we keep track of.","Obviously, we're very familiar with the revenue. What airlines try to do is to generate a certain amount of revenue per departure. And through an array of features that are offered, some customers will willingly pay more and some will willingly pay less, and that is the theory in a nutshell. So your question certainly has merit, but we're not specifically targeting that technique as a revenue initiative at this time.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay. Well, you mentioned, Gary, the bag fee, but you can get around that advantage by getting a branded credit card on one of the other guys, which is why I think that the lack of a change fee is so much more important as an advantage for you folks. But wouldn't there be an opportunity there to subsidize cheaper seats in the back?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, yeah, that's how it works. That's my point is that, yes, I think airlines understand that customers \u2013 they don't speak with one voice, so they come to us with an array of objectives. Some people want more, some people want less for a cheaper price. And so we try to strike that balance and offer them what we can professionally, expertly deliver, if you will. But, yeah, we do what you're describing today. We offer Business Select today. We offer EarlyBird today. So we do offer an array of attributes, and we try to make it a pure choice for the customer as opposed to forcing a customer to pay for a bag fee.","With respect to what our competitors do, we try to avoid the complexity, make it really easy. You don't have to jump through any hoops to have free bags on Southwest Airlines. And that works very well for us and we get tremendous brand loyalty as a consequence of that. So I think the answer to your question is, yes. And, David, we choose not to do those things. And obviously, what we've chosen to do works very well for us and makes us the most profitable airline, so I'm just glad everybody else doesn't do what we do.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Thank you very much.","Operator","And at this time I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Laurie. As always, if you all have any other questions, please do follow-up with our communications team.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Martinez - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Tom, and welcome, everyone to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today we have Gary Kelly, Chairman and CEO; Tom Nealon, President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other members of senior management.","Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements. And because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, which excludes special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","We will begin here shortly with Gary providing an overview of our performance, followed by Tammy providing a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance and current outlook. Following Tammy's remarks, all of our call participants will be available to answer your questions. And we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many question as possible.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Ryan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. I want to start out with a shout out to all the Southwest people. We've had really unprecedented storm challenges, fires, the Las Vegas situation and I don't know that we've ever had a 60-day period in our history where we had to deal with so many different external events like that. They did a phenomenal job. And of course, I'm very proud of the response that Southwest had for the communities that we serve. And we're continuing to keep all the folks that are impacted in our thoughts and prayers and continuing to do the best we can to support them in their recovery efforts.","So despite all of these challenges, it was a very strong quarter, and fourth quarter looks better. 2018 is also set up very well for unit revenue growth as well as margin expansion.","I found the third quarter and fourth quarter a bit challenging to interpret and there were a lot of moving parts. We have a new reservation system. New labor contracts went into effect in the intervening 12 months. Hurricanes, earthquakes, we grounded the 737-300 fleet. And the year-ago comps have some items in them as well. And I would say that that applies to both revenues as well as costs. So Tammy is going to cover it in more detail, and I suspect that we'll be redundant on some of these points, but hopefully that will be helpful to you.","So first of all, I just want to start out on revenues. Unit revenues were down 0.5 percentage point in the quarter, and there's no real surprise there. Without the $100 million hurricane impact, RASM would have been flat. As also what is not new news is that the new reservation system created a temporary onetime drag of roughly 0.5 point, a little bit more than that for several reasons: school calendars, our new reservation system, just the number of aircraft deliveries that we were accumulating in August. We extended our summer schedule farther than we typically do, and that proved to be a drag as well of roughly 0.5 point. That's not something that I anticipate we would repeat next year.","So you put all those things together and take those things into account, and it was a good result. The third quarter was more challenging on yields than the second quarter was. But, again, overall a very solid quarter and I think we're positioned well now for the fourth quarter.","The yield environment in the fourth quarter appears to be improved compared to where we were in third. The onetime effect of the new res system should not be repeated in the fourth quarter. The storms, the fires, the Las Vegas situation are certainly improved from where we were in third quarter, although there are still some recovery taking place, especially in Las Vegas.","We have a more aggressive schedule per aircraft because of the classic fleet grounding. That does present some drag, although overall, we'll definitely have a cost benefit of the grounding of the classics. But all in, we're expecting positive unit revenue comparisons versus a year ago and a sequential improvement to third quarter as well. And I'll just repeat again, we'll be watching Houston and Florida and Las Vegas recoveries very closely.","Our revenue outlook for 2018 is stable as well. Our goal, which I believe is realistic, is positive unit revenue growth for 2018 compared to 2017. Our new reservation system synergies of $200 million for 2018 is intact. So a solid revenue performance and a solid revenue outlook.","On the unit cost front ex-fuel and profit sharing, we were up 3.3%. There's no surprise there, maybe perhaps some good news compared to what we were expecting, but overall actually a very good performance. Costs were down across the board on a unit basis, except for the salaries category. So just remembering that the new labor contracts went into effect after last year's third quarter with snap-ups. That was 3.6%, meaning that unit costs would have been down, except for the new labor contracts.","Of course, those are real costs, and they are continuing. But more important for your analysis is the onetime effect of the storms on the third quarter and that was 2%. So if you take those two things into account, a very, very good cost performance for third.","As for the fourth quarter, we expect unit cost ex-fuel and profit sharing to be in the range of flat to up 1.5%. That's somewhat higher than our previous expectations, and I would say it's mostly timing. There is the remaining, a still, a year-over-year effect in the fourth quarter of roughly 0.5 point and a little bit more from the new labor contracts. We'll realize a nice benefit, as I mentioned earlier, from the grounding of the classics fleet. But our schedule is not fully optimized because we are trying to maintain as many flights with a fewer number of aircraft in the fleet. So I would expect that that would be more optimized by the time we get into the second half of next year. So a solid cost performance and a very solid cost outlook.","Overall through the first nine months, now almost 10 months in the year, I'm very pleased we have successfully deployed our new reservation system. We've successfully launched international flying out of a new terminal in Fort Lauderdale. We retired 67 airplanes from the classic fleet in the third quarter, which was a huge effort and done very successfully. And, of course, we launched the MAX on October 1.","Our growth is very manageable, both for this year and for next year. There's only about 3% of our system that we define under development, and I'm very comfortable with that. It's a very competitive environment out there, as everyone knows. But I would also say that that, at least for us, is very manageable, and especially considering the diverse and very solid and very strong route system that we have.","The economy and travel demand look very solid. And again, I'll just repeat, we're continuing to watch carefully Houston, Florida, Las Vegas and I should also mention Puerto Rico. The energy price outlook for the near term and for next year looks pretty favorable. I'm very happy with the hedging position that we have built for the next several years.","No change in our growth plans, no change in our fleet plans. We're just getting to work on Hawaii as you all now know, and we'll have more to report on that in the first quarter.","So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Tammy Romo.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Gary, and welcome, everyone. And I would like to start off by congratulating Mr. Kelly on his well-deserved The Wings Club's Distinguished Achievement Award last week. And I'd also like to start out by thanking all of our employees for their incredible efforts during the quarter. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who have been impacted by the hurricanes and earthquakes, the Las Vegas community and those impacted by the fires in California.","And while our third quarter operations were certainly impacted by the unprecedented number of natural disasters, we were very pleased to report strong third quarter profit of $503 million. Excluding special items largely related to the retirement of the classic fleet, our third quarter profits were a strong $528 million [with healthy margins. My congratulations to our Employees for their resilience and hard work this quarter to produce these strong results] (10:28-10:40) which earned them $127 million in profit sharing.","Jumping right into revenues, our operating revenues were a strong $5.3 billion, despite the significant impact from the hurricane. Our third quarter RASM decreased 0.5% year-over-year, which was in line with our most recent guidance. This included a revenue headwind from the implementation of our new reservation system of less than 1 point. The minor issues from the reservation system that caused the revenue impact in the third quarter have been remedied, and we don't expect an unfavorable impact here in the fourth quarter.","Third quarter started off with a positive year-over-year RASM growth in July. However, August and September were both impacted by the significant weather events and the competitive fare environment impacting close-in yields. As we noted in the earnings release, the hurricanes, the natural disasters caused approximately 5,000 flight cancellations in third quarter, which negatively impacted our third quarter revenue by $100 million.","Nearly 15% of our system ASMs touch Houston and the other stations in Texas that were impacted by Hurricane Harvey. And about 25% of our system ASMs touch Florida and other states nearby as well as near international destinations that were impacted by Hurricane Irma. However, both our Houston and Florida operations and employees are resilient, and the impacted stations and passenger demand have rebounded quite well.","All things considered, including our difficult year-over-year comparisons due to our strong industry outperformance over the last few years, we are very pleased with the overall resiliency of our revenue performance.","Our freight revenues were also solid, and third quarter other revenues increased approximately 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by the continued success of our Rapid Rewards loyalty program. And although the fare environment remains competitive here in October, it does appear to be stabilizing.","October passenger revenue yields are currently trending up nicely year-over-year, which is an improvement from August and September year-over-year yields. And I'll just point out that November and December are expected to have more challenging year-over-year unit revenue comparisons due to the boost in travel demand and yields last year, particularly between the holiday periods.","And while the December holidays fall similarly year-over-year, we are monitoring whether we'll see any negative impact from school holidays beginning later in the month, which may postpone more travel into January, but it's a little too early to tell.","That said, overall travel demand for the fourth quarter is solid, and we are very pleased with our current outlook for positive year-over-year unit revenue in fourth quarter.","Based on current bookings and revenue trends so far in October, we currently expect fourth quarter RASM to be up slightly to up 1.5% year-over-year. We also expect both freight revenue and other revenues to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","Turning now to cost. Our third quarter cost performance was within our expectations. Our third quarter economic fuel price per gallon was $2, which was at the lower end of our guidance. The retirement of the classic fleet and other ongoing fleet modernization initiatives drove a nearly 2% improvement in fuel efficiency year-over-year.","Since our last call, crude prices, as you know, are up. And for fourth quarter, we are estimating approximately $2.10 per gallon based on market prices last Friday and our current fourth quarter hedge position. This fourth quarter fuel cost estimate includes a $0.25 per gallon hedging loss. At the end of this year, our fuel hedging losses will burn off, providing meaningful tailwinds in 2018. All of our hedges in 2018 and beyond are call options and call spreads with no floor risk.","Excluding fuel and special items, our unit cost trends improved sequentially, as expected, with the continued benefits from the retirement of the classics and the wind-down of costs associated with the implementation of our reservation system.","With the retirement of the classics, we recorded two special items during the quarter. As expected, we had a $63 million aircraft grounding charge related to the remaining lease payment. We also recorded a $20 million lease termination charge related to the acquisition of four of our classic aircraft previously under operating leases.","And as a quick reminder, these charges were contemplated in the estimated $200 million EBIT improvement that we've been communicating from accelerating the classic retirements from 2021 to 2017.","Excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, our third quarter unit cost increased 3.3% year-over-year which came in at the lower end of our guidance. The year-over-year increase was driven by the hurricanes and wage rates from labor contracts, partially offset by classic retirement benefits.","Looking to fourth quarter, we continue to expect our unit cost inflation to ease considerably as compared with the first three quarters of the year. As we've stated before, this is due to the cost benefits associated with the retirement of the classic fleet and the lapse of the step up in wage rates from the labor agreements.","Based on current trends, we now expect fourth quarter year-over-year CASM excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to be in the range of flat to up 1.5% year-over-year. The primary drivers of this increase include a shift in advertising spend and incremental costs associated with technology investments, including ETOPS authorization in preparation for our Hawaii service. And adjusted for the hurricane and our investment in ETOPS, our full year CASM is in line with where we were in July on our last conference call.","Our investment-grade balance sheet remains very strong and continues to differentiate us in the airline industry. We are very proud of our recent rating agency upgrade from S&P to BBB+ in August, which is on the heels of our upgrade to A3 from Moody's in June. Our liquidity is strong with cash and short-term investments at quarter end of $3 billion. And our cash flows remain very healthy with operating cash flow of $3.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30.","Our CapEx guidance for 2017 is unchanged at $2.3 billion, which allows for healthy returns for our shareholders. And in August, we repurchased $300 million of common stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, leaving $1.7 billion remaining under our current $2 billion authorization.","Thus far in 2017, we have returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases is approximately 30%. And our goal remains to keep leverage in the low to mid-30% range.","And moving on to fleet, I am very proud of the many employees that were involved in the management of retiring our classic fleet. We started the year with 87 classics and retired 69 in third quarter alone as planned. That brought us to 687 aircraft at the end of the third quarter after the delivery of 20 (sic) [21] new and used aircraft during the quarter.","We are thrilled to introduce the MAX 8 into our network. We have 10 of them in our fleet currently and we'll have 14 by the end of this year. We continue to expect to end this year with 707 total aircraft and our fleet plans remain unchanged in 2018 with 750 aircraft.","On the capacity front, we continue to expect fourth quarter capacity to increase in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. And our 2018 capacity plans remain unchanged with expected ASM growth of less than 5.7% year-over-year. We expect first half 2018 ASM growth to be in the 3% to 4% range as we noted in our earnings release.","And as a recap, our return on invested capital for the last 12 months is a strong 26.8%, and 2017 is shaping up to be another just really stellar year. I am excited about 2018, including our future plans to serve Hawaii. And I want to thank our employees again for their hard work and perseverance in a challenging quarter and for all that they do on the front lines each and every day, and congratulate them on these great results again.","And with that, Tom, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And thank you for waiting. We'll now begin with our first question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hello. Mr. Keay?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Sorry. Can you hear me?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I can hear you now.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Sorry about that. Okay, thanks. So 2018 costs, Gary, you said you feel good about the RASM outlook for 2018. That's great. I would imagine you guys are enough through the budget process at this point to give us a preliminary look. Do you feel like having the expense behind you with the PSS cutover that we should start thinking about CASM ex fuel next year as being down?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I do feel really good about the cost outlook for 2018. Tammy, would you like to go through that?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","I would be delighted to. So yes, Hunter, we're still finalizing our 2018 plan. So I'm not prepared to provide guidance today. We plan to cover that on our January call. However, I'd be happy to provide you some thoughts and goals that we have for 2018.","On the cost front, we're still working through our multi-year plan, including how we want to invest in technology and other areas of the business. We have some wonderful tailwinds in 2018 related to benefits and depreciation, maintenance and aircraft rentals from the classic retirement and onetime cost associated with Lone Star as well as significant tailwinds for fuel with our hedging losses burning off this year. And with the classic retirement and launch of the MAX 8, we should have a meaningful fuel efficiency improvement in 2018.","As we move through our planning process for next year, some headwinds have also materialized, including costs such as landing fees. And as our -700 aircraft age, of course, we'll have some increasing maintenance cost there as well, and just other typical inflationary cost pressures.","Netting all of this out and considering that we will still be transitioning through the classic retirement as far as the network schedule goes, I think CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, would be a reasonable goal for us versus 2017. Of course, as always, we will continue to look for ways to manage those costs down, but I think down year-over-year cost per available seat mile excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items would be a stretch based on what we know today, which is of course a little more than what we knew at the time of our last call.","Overall, I am quite pleased with our early outlook for 2018. We are, as you \u2013 on the revenue front too as well, we're working hard to realize the benefits from our investments in our new reservation system. And we'll continue to be diligent on the cost front. And then kind of back to fuel, with the tailwinds I mentioned there and our goal to grow RASM, I do think that we are well positioned to expand our margins next year. And certainly costs are a big part of that story.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Tammy. And, Gary, on the positive RASM comment that you made, what gives you the confidence about that? And how much of that has to do with your view on industry conditions versus some of the Southwest specific stuff? And on the Southwest specific stuff, is it a load factors play? Is it a yield play? What are sort of the components of that that give you the confidence to put that out there at this point in time? Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Very fair questions, because nobody has a crystal ball. I think it is just recapping some of my opening comments. It's our view that the economy will continue to be stable. It's our view that the travel demand will continue to be very strong. And then, of course, we're overlaying that what is the competitive supply of seats that are out there.","And we're looking at the things that we have in the pipeline to bring it online next year. Of course, you all are well aware of our one res synergies that we've been talking about for some time. And then just looking at current trends, there's a lot of strength throughout the Southwest system. And I'm very happy with the progress that our development markets are showing.","Andrew Watterson and his team have been very active in pruning out some of the non-performers in our system. And off late of course, you're familiar that we eliminated flying to Varadero and Santa Clara. I was unhappy doing that, but it's clearly the right thing to do. So we'll continue to be active in managing the network.","At the same time, I want to let them take some risk and be aggressive, but overall, it feels like we're set up very well. Next year is fun in the sense that compared to gosh, the last five years, it's just more stable. There just aren't as many moving parts. We're not retiring fleets. We're not introducing new res systems. We're not opening up brand-new international terminals. The big-ticket item right now is just working on Hawaii, and I think that that will be less ambitious than what some of these other things have been. But my hats off to our folks for managing this well, and I think they'll continue to manage it with better tools next year.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thank you for the time. Just to clarify, Tammy, on your comments on the CASM outlook or framework for next year, at least on my line it sort of cut out when you were talking about the expectation. I think you said you're not expecting it to be \u2013 I think you said down year-over-year will be a stretch. But I didn't hear it, I guess, your exact comments on sort of your outlook for 2018 CASM ex. Could you just maybe go over that again a little bit?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure, Jack. Sure, and I'd be happy to. Just on our CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, as I said, getting down might be a stretch. But I do think that a flat CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items is a reasonable goal versus 2017.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I just wanted to make sure that that was out there great. And then just kind of...","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Absolutely. And then just sort of as my follow-up question, going back to the $200 million in pre-tax incremental profitability from the new reservation system next year, could you help us think through sort of the cadence of how that will flow through the P&L as we move through the year? Is that going to be sort of evenly distributed throughout 2018? Or is it more second half weighted? And then how should we think about that incremental profitability coming from revenue or cost? Just trying to think through how that's going to show up in the P&L next year.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure, Jack. Well, first of all, as we've indicated, this year, we're really focused on just implementing the \u2013 getting the new reservation system in. And as you know, that's gone very well. We actually have a couple of releases coming up here this year. And so we remain very pleased with the progress of the rollout that we would like to get a little further down the road before we provide additional breakdown of the $200 million EBIT. So we'll come back more later and fill in some of the blanks. But certainly with the ramp-up, I think it's reasonable to assume you'll see more of that as we get to more in the back half. But in terms of breaking it down any further for you, we'll come back as we finalize our plan and provide that likely on our January call. That's our current plan at the moment. But everything is going well, we're pleased with the progress and that's where we sit today.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's great. And one quick housekeeping item if I could squeeze this one in. Could you provide us with the hedge asset or liability as things stand today for 2019 if that's possible?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, absolutely. For 2019, it is just about $50 million.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon. I'm a little mad at Tammy. She beat me to the punch on the Wings Club Award, coming from somebody, Gary, that's also known you for over 25 years, I sincerely hope that you accept my congratulations as well. Very, very cool.","A question on Hawaii, and I know you're not ready to discuss routes and schedules and all that. But when I think about the time of day that most flights depart the West Coast to the number of time zones you cross, the implied arrival time back in California or on the West Coast, if you did maybe a 60-minute, 65-minute turn. I don't know. I sketched out several single aircraft patterns. And in most of the scenarios, it looks to me like you'd have adequate time to do some interisland turns.","And of course, shorter-haul flying is Southwest's bread and butter. And I know you're not going to say whether you would consider inter-island. But can you point me to anything in the work rules, the pilot duty regs, anything that would at least allow me to rule out the feasibility of running a couple of turns before you turn back to the mainland?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes. There's nothing that would rule it out.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And I think now that we are public with all of this exciting topic, that is an item of interest that customers in Hawaii have, that the state of Hawaii has. And obviously it's something that Andrew and his team are intrigued with as well. Step one, of course, is getting from California to Hawaii, but it is absolutely, everything you said is right, and it has been down our priority list, but we'll have serious consideration for that. And who knows, even if we don't do that initially, it's something that we would obviously continue to consider over time.","But I think everybody understands where we are. This is very high profile work, and we just can't keep it a secret. So we're letting the world know early on that we're working on it. And there are a lot of questions to be answered, when being one of the major questions that we just don't have those answers yet. But like I indicated in my earlier remarks, it feels like first quarter we might be in a position where we're prepared to reveal details there. But, no, there's nothing that would prohibit us from doing that that we know of at this time.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the sanity check. Second, as it relates to pricing, I just want to confirm that the older system put some limits on your ability to price match by channel. But the new system does give you more flexibility. So if an ultra low-cost competitor has a single daily fight at, I don't know, noon, you can match on your 12:20 departure, but you don't need to match at 9 in the morning or 5 in the afternoon. Is my understanding of the new system correct? And if so, is this what you're broadly doing or not? And I'm not asking about future pricing, just what's in the market right now.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, first of all, our folks have done an amazing job in managing revenues in what is a very sophisticated art and science with not the best tools. So I don't think it's a fair characterization to say that we could not do certain things.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","It is I think more accurate to say that we have far better tools now to do things along the lines that you're describing than what we've had in the past. Whether that will show up as a material difference in the future, I'd rather not comment on. But it is absolutely accurate to admit that we have much better up-to-date state of the art tools today than what we've been using. And what we've been trying to share is that it's a really good airline that has produced really good results, and we're just going to have better tools going forward. So clearly, that is one of the tools that we'll want to make good use of.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. And sorry again to miss you last week, Gary. Congrats.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the international side, I was just wondering if you can provide an update on how that expansion has gone, and just any opportunity to be a bit more aggressive in growing in those regions?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, Savi, and Tom and Tammy can pitch in here too. It's gone very well. Clearly those markets have similarities to domestic markets in the sense that they struggle a bit when we start. And then over time if we're managing it well, then they develop very nicely. So we have a little bit over 3% of our available seat miles trans-border.","I just have a few notes here handy. The capacity increase in the third quarter year-over-year was just under 19%, and the revenues far outpaced that. So we're seeing, which is an indication again to my point to you that these markets are, they're in the development phase, but they are developing very nicely.","Some of it is what Andrew has been doing, which is trimming out some of the underperforming routes, which aren't very many of them. But our RASM was up on a stage length and gauge adjusted basis, almost 8% year-over-year, so feeling really good about that. Load factors are really strong, I think.","So the net answer to your question is, absolutely, we have a lot of opportunities to grow there. We have a wealth of opportunities all over the place. So we have domestic opportunities. Everyone knows about Hawaii. We've got international. So we'll try to be as coy as we can about giving our competitors advance notice of where we intend to go next.","But we're struggling with our capacity here in the fourth quarter and the first quarter to be able to grow for the obvious reasons with the classic fleet retirement. So we'll have to see where Hawaii settles in. And the nice thing is, again we've got plenty of opportunities. If we're constrained in a certain region, then we've got more than ample opportunities to grow somewhere else. We are following through with our announcement to open up service to Turks and Caicos, and that will be next month. So we've done a full assessment after Hurricane Irma there, and all systems are go.","But that Turks and Caicos is the last city that you know of, or destination that you know of that we're adding, but we have plenty more to choose from. But admittedly right now, we're looking at Hawaii and what it's going to take to start that service. And clearly, that will be our next priority. If we have room to add some more international destinations next year, that would be fantastic. We do want to continue to support our growth in Houston and Fort Lauderdale in particular.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","If I might follow up on that, Gary, so next year, I think your previous comments have been that you'd be accelerating domestic growth and focusing on that, and letting international digest itself. Is that still the case? What level do you think is going to see acceleration?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Savi, I think that's very fair, and that is what we have done thus far with the schedules that we produced. We're about to publish the schedule next month. Andrew, that would take us through August, I believe?","Andrew Watterson - Southwest Airlines Co.","Beginning of August.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Beginning of August for next year. So at least with what you've seen through the first half of the year, yes, that's been more of a domestic focus. And we haven't opened anything beyond Turks and Caicos. So we'll, as per usual, we'll continue to wait until the very last minute to commit, but certainly, that's been \u2013 that has been our focus for the first half of the year and may very well prove to be \u2013 we may very well not add any more new destinations. Hawaii is the thing for us to answer right now.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. Thanks. Can you talk about the next maybe two, three, four IT systems that are in the pipeline, what's the most material contribution from those would be? Now that you've got the big res migrated, what are your next two or three priorities?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I would say that the reservation system, by the way, is still a huge focus for us. We've got a major release coming out next month. But let me let Tom take you through that.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Okay. Well, so let's talk about res for a second. So in mid-November, we'll be releasing release 2.5, which really cleans up all the operational revenue leakage stuff that we've been dealing with. So that's going great. All that kind of stuff is going well.","I think the next set of big investments are really not on the commercial side. I think we have a very good set of capabilities there now. It's going to be more on the operational side. We have work going on right now replacing our maintenance systems, our aircraft maintenance portfolio is under development right now. Flight planning and scheduling is being upgraded and replaced as well as crewing systems.","So those are the three big platforms. If you think about an airline, I think you get all four of those, res, crewing, maintenance and flight operations. That is the foundation. And we're building this. In fact, I would tell you that if we were not planning to grow, what we have today is really pretty darn solid. It's pretty good. But if you do intend to grow, which we do, we need to have a foundation that can grow with us. That's what we're doing. And Mike and I are really closely linked on what does the operation look like with those new capabilities. So those are the priorities right now.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And the only thing I'd add is that in terms of the benefits, we have opportunities to continue with our fleet modernization efforts that have a cost benefit, and then also, these systems that Tom was describing, it's Mike's goal to create an opportunity for our operations to become more and more and more efficient. So we've changed a lot over the last 15 years. We have much higher load factors than we did 1.5 decades ago. We have more connecting passengers. The bags per passenger, Mike, I think are about the same, but it's just the volumes are greater. And some of our operational systems struggle to keep up with that, very much in line with Tom's point. So, there will be an investment, but I'm also very hopeful that there will be tangible financial benefits that will flow from these operating system enhancements.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. And may be just to dig in a little bit further there with respect to flight planning and scheduling. Can you speak to when that would go live? And maybe next year or three quarters from now, like how will that improve your ability to be tactical within the month or within the quarter on capacity changes? Could you just contrast the flexibility that you'll have in the future relative to what you're dealing with right now?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, it's early, but what I would tell you is unlike the one res, we truly went in two big releases. Now we have kind of minor release going in. But it was kind of \u2013 let me call it big bang, but it was kind of a big bang. Unlike one res, I think what you're going to see with things like crewing systems and flight planning, flight control is going to be more of an incremental function being added in over time. It's just too early days, but it's going to transcend or really transpire over several years. We're fairly well into it, but I'm not sure I can really give you a more definitive answer than that.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Duane, I don't remember, Tom, that we have any major operational functionality that's deploying next year maybe aside from the maintenance record keeping system...","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, we have our tech ops system, we'll be deploying late, late in the year. But we've already deployed some really good recovery tools. It's called The Baker IROPS tools. And we're going to continue to put functionality into that and that's pretty meaningful for us.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So I think, again, to summarize the \u2013 for the near term, we'll be continuing to implement follow-on releases of the reservation system. And obviously we want to finish what we started there. And there is tremendous value to be earned from that. That will need to continue to be a priority.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for your time. Mostly I wanted to ask if you've seen legacy carriers, United and American in particular, deploy their basic economy product and scale in your markets? And if so, whether you believe you are gaining market share in those markets as a result?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I get the implications. We can kind of argue this from both ways in theory. Is it good for us? Is it bad for us? So far, I don't sense that we can tell one way or the other. It's certainly not hurting us. Whether it's helping us, I don't know at the margin. In terms of our brand, I can assure you it is helping us. We have a lot of fans and we're grateful for them. So they love Southwest Airlines, and we're trying to be their most loved airline. But here in the meantime, I'm just giving you an honest answer. I don't sense that it's moving the needle one way or the other. Do you agree, Tammy?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","I completely agree.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","But I love...","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry, go ahead. Sorry, Gary.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Tom, do we have another question?","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, Gary, just want to come back to the pricing comments that you guys made \u2013 it might have been Tammy, I'm sorry. But, you did say that it appears the fares are improving in your markets from August into September and into the fall. Do you think that's just a function of improving demand or is it capacity dynamics that are more impacting your network to maybe others?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, from month to month, I just don't know that the markets are that dynamic. So I think it's just pricing, to be blunt. I think pricing is very dynamic and hard as just speaking as one carrier, it's impossible for us to predict what behaviors we'll have from our competitors. And then as a consequence of that, what moves we'll need to make to react. So, overall, it just feels like the yield environment is better. Well, it doesn't feel like it is. It is better in October than it was during the third quarter, which was a wild ride, I think as everybody knows. Second quarter was pretty darn good. And then all of a sudden, things got off the rails a little bit. I think the point I was trying to make in my earlier comments is that we're fine with that. We have a very low cost structure. We have a very diverse route system. We're continuing to strengthen it with flights where we need them, and we're trimming out where we don't. And we can handle all this.","So, we'll have ups and downs to a degree. But in the grand scheme of things, our revenue production all year has been quite good, softer in some periods than others. Right now, we're on a bit of an upswing. And just to make sure you caught what I said earlier, we seasonally \u2013 sequentially rather, we are seeing improvement in the fourth quarter so far compared to where we were in the third quarter. And then obviously, Tammy and I made the point several times that the year-over-year comps are so far looking pretty good.","The holiday travel for November look strong. The December is a little far out and a little less definitive right now how it will compare. As usual, we always struggle a little bit with how holiday travel will occur on the calendar. Whether it's December, January, that flips a little bit. I think the calendar is pretty close. I think it's just \u2013 well, obviously, just one day different than last year. But right now, well again, we're looking for an improved yield environment and good compares versus a year ago.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate the thorough response. And I think one of your smaller competitors out in California called out some weakness specifically in that market. So that could have gotten investors worked up a little bit. But, I guess, the longer-term issue or question I have for you...","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I can comment on that if that's a question. As we look regionally, there's no question that where there is vigorous fare activity, there's more of an impact on us. And Tammy shared that earlier this morning on a media interview; Chicago, Houston, even Denver to some degree. California is very competitive, but it performed very well in the third quarter, pretty close to in line with the system average. But I certainly wouldn't say that we're seeing weakness in California, but it just harkens back to my earlier comment, we're the number one airline in California. We have a very strong fan base there. We're continuing to add flights to meet the needs of our customers in those markets and grow where we can. And those results look very good, particularly considering that we've added quite a bit of capacity out there off late.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I think that's very helpful for your investor base. I'm sorry, I'm going to sneak one more, and I very rarely violate that rule. But you are going to be in an asset position on your hedge book. So does that change your philosophy at all on pricing when you think about fares in the 2018? I know you want to have up unit revenues, but...","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. We're going to go crazy. No, I think as we have said for years, we want to be disciplined about how we manage our growth and how we set expectations for revenue production in our markets. And our goal for next year is positive unit revenue production. Even knowing that our CASM will be down next year, assuming that fuel prices behave themselves.","Tammy has already mentioned that her goal for all the rest of the cost structure ex profit sharing, all that stuff that you list is flat. So yeah, we want to continue to boost our unit revenues and maintain that discipline. We're very leveraged to fuel prices. I don't have to tell you all that. I'm happy with our hedge position. But I think it would be foolish to behave in such a way that doesn't recognize \u2013 that wouldn't recognize that fuel could change course and all of a sudden it create problems. So that will be our goal. And as I said earlier, I think that is a realistic goal.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Good afternoon.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Gary or Tammy, can you provide a bit more color on what you're including in your 4q RASM guide? Are you reflecting demand hedge from places like Houston and Vegas? Is there a calendar hit in there? I think, Gary, you mentioned something about elongated schedules. Is that something that's hitting the results? Just some color would be great.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, all those things are in there. And the only cautionary note that I offered up, I'll let Tammy speak for herself, is that Las Vegas isn't back to a 100%. I'm assuming that it will be here at some point. Houston and Florida looked to me like they're still lagging a bit. I think our guys are pretty happy with where we are there. But I think it's just the recognition that those situations are a little volatile. And in Puerto Rico in particular, I was asked earlier this morning, what our prediction about Puerto Rico is a year from now. I just don't know. I don't know when that will fully recover. But with those caveats, I don't think we are implying that we're expecting miracles in any of these markets whatsoever. If anything, maybe we've got a little bit of a cautious approach out there. But, Tammy, anything you want to add?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","No. I think we've covered all the highlights for fourth quarter. And I agree, we've got our best estimates incorporated in the guidance that we've given you here today.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And the drag on the schedule from the retirement of the classics, I don't see any upside there. I think that will continue to be a bit of a drag because there are simply later or earlier flights in the day from what people really want, and we're very familiar with that. But my point is that as we tighten up the schedule, the objective will be to tighten up the schedule as time goes by and we get more aircraft deliveries. Our target would be to see some improvement there.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just those headwinds that you're talking about, Gary, Tammy, is that like a point or so? Can you put maybe a finer point on it?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. 0.5 point on that particular item. On Las Vegas, Houston or Florida, Tammy, I don't know if you have a number in mind or not. I didn't.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. If I \u2013 quantifying just for on the revenue side, the Las Vegas, and it probably drove the California fires in that, maybe that was probably a $10 million to $15 million impact, so again, not too significant.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just the second question. In terms of the capacity side of things, what's the latest thinking on growth in the back half of next year, and the factors that will drive that range? Obviously, you guys have done a good job with providing the first half, but any more color will be great.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","As we said earlier, Rajeev, we're going to update as we publish our schedules. So we're not prepared to give you specific guidance today on the second half of next year. So I think I'll just stick to what we've already shared.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, there's no change. I think Hawaii may be \u2013 whatever happens with Hawaii may impact our available seat miles, but there is no change in the airplanes. We have schedules out there. Tammy said three to four for the first half for next year. Obviously, if we're less than 5.7, it means we would grow more than that in the second half. So you should absolutely expect that, but.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","But that's really driven by the classic fleet retirement.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Right, exactly.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","So, nothing really new there.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. That's right. That's just year-over-year comps.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Gary, Tammy, thank you much.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question, and it comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Hey, just a quick one here. Gary, at this point, do you have the capability, I know Tom talked about the systems and maybe Tom can chime in as well, just the capability to do red eyes? And if you don't, if you can't do red eye flying now, is that something that you would want to be able to do at the time that you started Hawaii, or do you feel like you could serve those markets without flying red eyes?","Andrew Watterson - Southwest Airlines Co.","We are going forward, and I want Mike to, if he has something he wants to add to this, to chime in. We are going forward with our Hawaii work without red eyes. Right now, I'll just speak for Gary right now, but we don't really desire to fly red eyes right now. So just for our style of operation, it would complicate things. I'm assuming, Mike, both Mikes, Michael and Mike, that at some point we will want that capability. Tom went through the list of technology priorities earlier, and it's just down the list. So we can do Hawaii without the red eyes. Whether we feel strongly that there's a revenue benefit from having the red eyes, I don't think we've judged that yet. And then Mike Van de Ven, of course, has to deal with all the complication of doing that. But Mike, do you have anything you want to add?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","No, I don't really have anything else to add. We've got those capabilities identified that we'd like. We've got them a little bit lower on our priority list. And it does introduce some operational complexity in terms of the crew scheduling and the maintenance programs that we all want to work through and just make sure that we have that capability being delivered in the year we really want it.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So as you can tell, Mike Linenberg, it's not a priority for us. And it's not a factor, in our view, with our Hawaii service.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, very good. That's all I needed to know. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.","Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Tom. And welcome to the media members of our call on our call today. We can go ahead and get started with the Q&A. Tom, if you'll just give them some instructions on how to queue up to ask questions.","Operator","Yes, ma'am. And thank you for waiting. We'll now begin with our first question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Gary, I just wanted to know kind of where things stand in Washington, D.C. with all the different discussions that are going on up there, specifically with air traffic control reform. Is there sort of a path forward to see they get some momentum? Are you waiting on your people in D.C. to kind of take that up?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Conor, the House has been attempting all month as I recall to get the FAA reauthorization to the House floor. And so far, they have not done that. And I think that that is just an indication that perhaps all the votes aren't lined up yet. Now the focus, as we know, has turned to tax reform. And so I don't know how that might or might not interfere with this effort.","But overall, I've been encouraged this year, and it is the fact that the administration is behind exactly what we would like to do is a plus. The House leadership I think is behind the reform effort that members of the FAA, our leaders of the FAA have actually come out in support of the effort. So it's not done yet, but I don't know any more about it than that. I don't know if there is a desire to have a vote this year or not. I hope there is.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Good morning. Gary, you mentioned a couple times Vegas is still not 100% from where it was. Can you add any color to that? I mean is this business, leisure, short-haul, long-haul, all across the board, anything regional? Can you give any more color on that front?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I think it's pretty straightforward. I think it is obviously a huge vacation destination. It is traffic related, and I think totally understandable. So we're very close with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau and the entire community there. And we'll all work together. I, quite frankly, I'd be surprised if we weren't back to 100% by the end of this quarter, if not before. But it's not...","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Are you making any adjustments?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, adjustments in terms of our flight schedule?","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Yeah, flight schedules, fares, I mean anything to maybe get people that, maybe have some.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I think in fairness, we're always making adjustments. But in terms of a major change with our flight schedule or a major change with our fares, no.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","We're mainly, just making sure that everybody knows, again, working with Las Vegas that we're open for business. And I'm confident that the traffic will come back and grow.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Can you say how much the traffic is down?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I'd be happy to if I knew it off the top of my head. Tammy, do you have a number in your mind?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","I don't have the traffic number in my mind. But, as I mentioned earlier, the impact that we're expecting here in the fourth quarter is pretty minimal in the $10 million to $15 million range. And that's what we're estimating. So beyond that, I don't have the traffic numbers top of mind.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Dawn, if it were a 100%, if that were the standard, it's not that we're down by 50%, we may be down 10% or 15% something in that order of magnitude. But, I'd be surprised if we were down that much now quite frankly.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ghim-Lay Yeo with FlightGlobal.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question about the Hawaii service. Can you talk a little bit about just the ETOPS certification and maybe Mike could chime in if he is still on the line. But how soon after getting initial ETOPS for the 737-800s where we see Boeing 737 MAX service? Thanks.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. So we have got a team of people working on our policies and procedures. The great thing is we don't have to invent them. They're out there. We just need to gather them and write them in a manner that works in our procedure manuals and then get training done. So what we've been doing is sitting around doing tabletop exercises with the FAA making sure that we have those procedures and training requirements clearly written.","We're going to take that package and we will actually apply for an ETOPS certification, add it to our ops specs early next year. And then the FAA will go through their approval process. And that could take anywhere from maybe 6 to 12 months with them, just depending on their staffing and their challenges and what they need to do. So we are going to launch with the 800 there. We have that airplane today. It's ETOPS-capable. And that's our quickest path to Hawaii. And then we will begin discussing with the FAA what we need to do to have the MAX ETOPS certified. It will be our Hawaii airplane for the future for us and then the foundation for our service.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal","Okay. But how soon after launching Hawaii service initially? I mean, how many more months do you have to wait before you can actually get the MAX on board? Do you have an idea about that?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","How long before we can do what? Oh, how do we?","Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal","Yeah. Before you can actually get the MAX flying to Hawaii?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, that's what we need to work with the FAA on and understand what they need to see from us in order to get that certified to do that.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal","Okay. Thank you.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","I don't have an answer to that question until we get more information from the FAA.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Great. Hey, Mike, I wanted to ask you how the MAX is performing. So far, you had a few issues on the initial flights. Can you talk about how it's been going since then?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Oh, sure. Yes. We have 10 airplanes in service today, Mary. And what I've been saying is it is as advertised. So we've got a 14% fuel burn improvement as compared to the 800. We've flown over 1000 flights with it so far. We've had 152,000 customers on it. It's been through about two-thirds of our system domestically. And the reason I just \u2013 and so we haven't had any surprises or unexpected issues with that airplane. So we do have the typical newness on the airplane, a lot of first time experiences and slightly different procedures on the airplane. But it has just been performing, as I said, as advertised. I'm very excited about adding the airplane to the fleet.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Do you have any kind of a number, like a dispatch reliability number or anything like that for the MAX so far?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","They are right in line with the rest of the system, the rest of that, like our 800s, they're right in line with the 800s. Of course, as you mentioned, we did have on one of the airplanes that we launched service. We had a fairly unique maintenance issue on that airplane. It hasn't been reproduced across the global fleet. We've been working with Boeing on that; got that fixed. It's back in service, and it's performing just exactly in line with the dispatch reliability of the 800s.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Great. And if I could also ask, there was a local article yesterday about AMFA trying to or threatening to try to block Hawaii service. I wanted to see if you all would confirm, you've said in the past that there's nothing in your labor contracts that would prohibit Hawaii service. I just want to see if that's correct for that group as well?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","That's correct.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And that is our final question. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda B.

My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's conference. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call to discuss first quarter results. Joining me on the call today is Gary Kelly, Southwest's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and President of AirTran Airways; and Laura Wright, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will begin with opening comments from Gary, followed by Bob providing an update on AirTran. And then Laura will provide a review of our first quarter results and current outlook.","As a quick reminder, Southwest's first quarter 2012 consolidated results include AirTran's results. Prior-year consolidated results do not include AirTran. However, in order to provide what we believe to be more meaningful year-over-year comparisons on today's call, we will also be discussing specified results on a combined basis as defined in this morning's press release.","In addition, outlook commentary will be provided on a combined basis. Please be advised that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current intent and expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","As this call will include references to non-GAAP results such as combined results and results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","And now I'll turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary C. Kelly","Thank you, Marcy, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. We'll jump right in here.","We -- while we had a modest operating profit of $10 million, we had a net loss of $18 million, excluding items first quarter. Better than estimates, it represents a $38 million swing from last year's modest net profit. So comparing to combined with AirTran results from a year ago, our fuel bill was up about $216 million on essentially a flat capacity, and that was the challenge that we had to overcome and with revenues. Our revenue performance was strong. We were up almost 6% on a combined basis year-over-year.","While I am dissatisfied with our earnings results even with the seasonally slow first quarter, I'm very proud of our people. I'm very proud of their revenue performance. On top of all that, our operations turned in the best on-time performance in, I think, 2 decades. So very, very strong operating performance.","So I'm not going to try to rationalize a first quarter net loss. But I will share that it was the January, February problem. If you look at March's results, our profits were better than a year ago. And so far, the same is true for April.","Obviously, our profit outlook has much to do with fuel prices, and we're keeping a wary eye out on that. The real story besides fuel is the construction work that's underway at Southwest Airlines investing in our future. We have a -- a huge amount has been accomplished since 2010, including our All-New Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program, the AirTran acquisition and a major new contract with the Boeing Company.","But since last year, we've made significant progress integrating AirTran, in particular, and I just wanted to run through that very quickly with you. First of all, we have a handful of labor seniority list agreements that are done, and I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making on the ones that are not done yet.","We've consolidated the AirTran headquarters function into Dallas. We've implemented all new aircraft maintenance management technology. We have implemented technology to support multiple fleet types. We've, of course, received our single operating certificate from the FAA. We have also, since then, we've launched conversion lines to move AirTran 737s into the Southwest Airlines livery, that work is underway. We plan to get 11 airplanes converted here in 2012. We made significant changes to AirTran's revenue management processes and also significant changes to AirTran's flight schedule, including the redeployment of aircraft to new markets, hopefully more lucrative international markets. ","Related to all that, we've spent months working on the best international solution for Southwest Airlines. As you all know, we're -- our technology is all domestic. And I'm very pleased that this morning, we announced Amadeus as our reservations technology solution for Southwest International. Implementing that will be a top priority for us so that we can operate flights in 2014.","It also sets the stage for us to move all of our reservations, the domestic reservations that is, to Amadeus if we choose to. ","Along those same lines, we see a significant opportunity to serve Houston with international flights out of Houston's Hobby Airport. We have a major campaign underway to obtain the necessary approvals to launch that service in 2015, which is what the Houston airport service would like.","And finally, soon the technology will be ready to allow Southwest and AirTran's frequent flyers to use their flight awards on either carrier, and that'll be a very nice enhancement for our customers.","Unrelated to AirTran, but significant nonetheless, is the addition of the 737-800 to our fleet. This was a significant effort to develop the required technology along with new procedures and certifications. So we have our first 2 aircraft up and flying in revenue service this month, and this whole effort was done on time and on budget.","We've also begun the cabin retrofit of our 737-700s, which not only improves the customer comfort but delightfully, we're able to get 6 more seats onto our 700s. That work has started. And we continue to work the bugs out of our Row 44 Wi-Fi product. I believe we have about 250 aircraft that are -- 210, I beg your pardon, aircraft that are outfitted, and we are anxious to get that rolled out by first quarter next year on our 700 fleet. Notably, the 800s will come delivered with the Row 44 Wi-Fi equipment.","So just as a reminder for everyone, we have 5 strategic initiatives that we're focused on over the next several years. Two are already up and running and in production, which is our All-New Rapid Rewards program and the 737-800. The other 3 remain a very significant work in progress, which is the AirTran integration, fleet modernization and ultimately, our reservation system replacement, which you now know at least the international piece of that will be Amadeus.","A lot of work has been done, I want to, again, thank all of our people not only for the terrific results on a daily basis serving our customers, earning Southwest such high brand rankings. But I also want to thank them for their hard work on these strategic initiatives. There's a lot of work to be done, but I'm very, very, very pleased with the progress we have so far. ","So Bob, how about if I just hand it over to you and you can tell us what's going on at AirTran?","Robert E. Jordan","All right, Gary. Thank you, and thank you to everybody who is joining us on the call today. I am very pleased to give you a report on AirTran and on the integration. But first, I want to congratulate of our AirTran folks on continuing to keep their eye on the business as we make progress on integration.","The AirTran operation is performing very, very well. For the second year in a row, AirTran came in first in the annual Airline Quality Rating or the AQR. AirTran also continues to post industry-leading DOT numbers. For example, in February, AirTran posted a 91.2 on-time performance. That's 5 points ahead of the industry average and a 1.32 mishandled bag ratio, which is half of the industry average. And it's all because of the people of AirTran and their focus, and I am very proud of them.","On the integration front, there's a lot to report. We were delighted to receive our single operating certificate last month. To get to SOC at just 10 short months is remarkable. Southwest and AirTran will, of course, continue to operate independently, but SOC gives us the ability to begin to combine the operations. And for example, the first 3 AirTran 737s are now in conversion to the Southwest livery. And our first groups of AirTran pilots are currently in training to move to Southwest. As Gary noted, we'll transition 11 aircraft to Southwest in 2012, and the majority of the remainder of those AirTran aircraft will transition to Southwest in 2013 and early 2014.","We also continue to make progress on the labor front. We now have agreements with our pilots, our flight attendants and our flight instructors. And we are making progress in other areas, and I hope to have something to report there soon. We have now transitioned facilities in a total of 24 airports, bringing AirTran and Southwest much closer together to enhance the customer experience there, and over 400 AirTran employees have now fully transitioned to Southwest Airlines.","We are also continuing to make AirTran -- the network moves, many of those in the first quarter, most notably, the introduction of Southwest service to Atlanta on February 12, which has been just a fantastic complement to our existing AirTran service there. While it's early, the new Southwest service is already beating our expectations for both traffic and revenue performance. And to redeploying capacity primarily from our closed small cities on the AirTran network side, we've added a number of new AirTran international markets, including Denver-Cancun that started earlier this week, and in the next 60 days, we'll be adding San Antonio-Mexico City; San Antonio-Cancun or Orange County-Mexico City; Orange County-Cabo San Lucas and Midway-Cancun. I'm really pleased with the performance of our international markets, and I'm just very optimistic about their future potential.","And as Gary noted, the agreement announced this morning with Amadeus to develop a robust international solution for Southwest is a key to moving these international markets from AirTran to Southwest over time.","Overall, AirTran's business continues to improve solidly year-over-year. Positive RASM trends continue, and AirTran's yields outperformed Southwest in the first quarter, up about 13% year-over-year.","The synergies realized in the first quarter are already half of the $80 million realized in all of 2011, and our plan calls for reaching our $400 million total pretax synergies in 2013.","We've made a lot of progress. We've got a lot of work in front of us. We've got a lot of complicated work in front of us that we're managing, and that includes fully connecting the networks that we anticipate having in place in 2013. But there is just an awful lot of progress in the short 11 months since we closed this transaction on May 2 last year.","In summary, I am just very pleased with how the integration is going. I'm very pleased with AirTran's performance, operational and business year-over-year. And I can report that the people of both AirTran and Southwest continue to be extremely positive and excited about the integration, and that is just unheard of in the airline industry.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Laura to take us through the financials.","Laura H. Wright","Thank you, Bob, and good morning or afternoon to everyone. Excluding special items, our first quarter operating profit was $10 million compared to $110 million in the first quarter of last year for Southwest stand-alone and $86 million combined.","Our revenue performance in the first quarter was strong, and our nonfuel operating costs came in better than expected.","I'd like to thank our employees for answering the call to focus on cost and productivity in the first quarter. Certainly, their efforts produced tangible results.","The primary source of our decline in our operating profit was higher fuel prices. Excluding special items, we reported a net loss of $18 million or $0.02 per diluted share, and this compared favorably to first call's consensus estimate of a $0.05 loss.","Our first quarter was another quarter of strong revenue performance. We have record operating revenues, passenger revenues, passenger revenue yield, passenger unit revenues and total unit revenues.","Our passenger revenues increased 27% or $795 million from last year's $2.9 billion Southwest-only results. 3\/4 of this passenger revenue growth was attributable to AirTran, and the remaining 1\/4 or approximately $200 million was from organic growth at Southwest. On a combined basis, our revenues experienced a solid improvement. On a unit basis, our passenger unit revenues grew 5% versus last year, and our total unit revenues grew 4.6%.","Compared to 2 years ago, our passenger unit revenues are up 15%, and they're up over 30% versus the first quarter of 2009. That represents remarkable revenue progress, especially as we manage through a complex integration and certainly is industry-leading, if you look over a several year time period.","During the quarter, our PRASM strength came primarily from our yields, which were up 6.3% on a combined basis. And as Bob noted, we continue to improve AirTran's year-over-year revenue performance.","Our average fares on a combined basis were up 6.3% or $8.71, as a result of 5 systemwide fare increases we've taken since the first quarter of last year.","We have a solid outlook for our second quarter passenger revenues. At this point, our April month-to-date year-over-year increase in passenger unit revenues is currently exceeding March's 5% year-over-year increase.","Our freight and other revenues were in line with our expectations, and we currently expect our second quarter 2012 freight and other revenues to be comparable to second quarter 2011 freight and other revenues.","Now turning to fuel, our first quarter 2012 economic fuel price per gallon was $3.44. That was up 16.6% or about $0.50 per gallon from the prior year combined. The $3.44 included $0.12 in per gallon and unfavorable cash hedging settlements, primarily from locks and losses from our legacy hedging portfolio. We were able, however, to reduce our hedging premiums to $6 million versus $31 million in the prior year, and those premiums are reflected in other gains and losses.","The $3.44 was better than our last guidance for the quarter of $3.50, and that was primarily due to slightly lower-than-expected refinery margins as our physical fuel purchasing and flight selling techniques took advantage of favorable geographical jet fuel pricing that took place during the quarter.","Looking to the second quarter, our hedge protection is minimal, which is a result of reducing our floor exposure and recapturing premium expense. At current market prices, we expect our second quarter economic fuel price, including taxes, to be in the $3.40 to $3.45 per gallon range. That's based on the April 16 forward curve.","As noted in our fuel hedging sensitivity table that is included in this morning's press release, this includes an estimated $0.03 per gallon unfavorable hedging loss, much less than what we had in the first quarter.","Our second quarter premium expense is also expected to be down to approximately $12 million. That compares to $26 million a year ago. ","As we look to the second half of 2012, our hedges provide meaningful protection in a rising fuel price environment with 25% to 50% of our fuel volume hedged in the $90 to $130 WTI range.","At current expected market prices, our second half fuel hedge portfolio performed better than the first half. And at current prices, we expect a $0.02 per gallon hedge benefit.","In the event prices rise from the current forward levels, some will benefit from our fuel hedge protection. Again, all this is laid out in the sensitivity tables that were provided in this morning's release.","Our second half premium expense is estimated to be $27 million. That brings our total 2012 premium cost to $45 million. That compares to $114 million a year ago.","Turning to our nonfuel costs. Our first quarter unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, were up 2% year-over-year on a combined basis. This was better than the 4% increase that we expected, primarily due to lower labor, airport and other costs. The milder winter weather certainly provided some unexpected benefit in both our labor cost and our winterization materials. We did diverse some advertising spend and our airport cost benefited more than we anticipated from airport settlements.","As we look to the second quarter, we're currently anticipating unit cost, excluding fuel and profit-sharing, to increase in the low to mid-single-digit range compared to second quarter of 2011's combined $0.0741 and likely at the rate that will exceed our first quarter 2% inflation.","The second quarter year-over-year increase is primarily driven by increased labor, maintenance and airport cost. Additionally, our year-over-year increase also includes some unique items related to our fleet modernization plans. In the second quarter, we expect about a 1-point cabin impact from these initiatives. Again, just to remind you, the Evolve retrofit for our 700 fleet is expected to increase our full year 2012 maintenance expense by about $50 million. We expect about $14 million of that in the second quarter. We also have some additional depreciation expense, which is noncash due to the accelerated retirement of our [indiscernible] fleet, and that's currently projected to be in the $50 million range in 2Q.","Our net interest expense for the year is expected to decrease by approximately $60 million on a combined basis due to paying down $1 billion of debt since our acquisition of AirTran on May 2 of last year.","And again, as noted in our fuel discussion, our fuel hedging premiums, which were recorded in other gains and losses, will be down approximately $70 million from 2011.","Our cash flow in the quarter was very strong. We generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations, and that resulted in $1.1 billion of free cash flow net of our capital spending during the quarter of $127 million. Our cash and short-term investments at quarter end were $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion as of close of business yesterday, with full availability of our $800 million revolving credit facility.","The strong cash flow was driven in part by cash collateral from our hedge counterparties, as well as a $720 million increase in our air traffic liability. ","All-New Rapid Rewards continues to perform well with approximately $100 million in incremental cash sales from our business partners compared to first quarter of last year. And as a reminder, the vast majority of the business partner cash flows are still being deferred, which is increasing our air traffic viability, and those will be recognized in passenger revenues as more flights occur in the future.","During the quarter, we repaid $431 million of debt. And our leverage, including the off-balance sheet leases, the aircraft leases, is approximately 46%. We expect it to continue to decline modestly throughout the year.","Through the end of the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 275 million or 33.2 million shares, of LUV, under our current 500 million authorization. And for 2012, we still expect our capital spending to be in the $1.3 billion range.","For the remainder of the year, we have very manageable scheduled debt maturities of approximately $130 million. And again, extremely pleased with the cash generation the first quarter, which is typically the weakest quarter of the year.","And finally, let me finish with a quick fleet and capacity overview. We ended the first quarter with 694 active aircraft. This does not include the first 2 Boeing 800 deliveries we took in March as they did not go into active service until this month. We also had 4 retirements during the quarter. They were all 300 and classics the 3 of those were lease returns. And so far in April, we've received another 800, and we have another 1 coming today. And after today's delivery, we'll have 29 more by year end.","We're still planning for 40 total retirements that will put our year-end fleet count at approximately 691. We've completed 14 of the Evolve retrofits thus far, and we expect to have the entire Southwest 700 fleet retrofitted by first quarter 2013. The majority of that will occur this year.","In terms of our capacity plans, our 2012 available seat miles forecast remains approximately flat with 2011. And although we are increasing the gauge with the 800, which adds 38 more seats and we're adding additional seats to our 700 fleet with Evolve, our 2012 trips are projected to be down 3% year-over-year. That's heavily weighted to the back half with a 4% decrease in trips in 3Q and a 5% decrease in the fourth quarter.","And, Tom, with that, I am ready to turn the call over to you to take questions from the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just with respect to your seasonality of earnings, just thinking about AirTran's earnings profile, it seems like they made all their money in the June quarter. So I mean, is it fair to say some of what we're seeing here in the March quarter is just maybe a modestly more seasonal earnings stream for Southwest?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, they've got a pretty big footprint in Florida, too. But the -- first of all, a lot of things have changed under the Southwest watch since a year ago with AirTran. I think what is a fact is that we've been able to reduce their cost pretty significantly. And as a consequence, Bob gave you a very comprehensive report on their first quarter revenue performance. But in addition to that, the net effect was, and you'll see this in the 10-Q, their loss was worse a year ago than this year. So we've been able to make some improvements on the AirTran performance. But I thought that their revenue performance was better in the fourth quarter than it was in the first. So there -- you may have a point there. This is -- this business segment is new to us, and it is a little different for us because it does have different drivers. Their bag fees and dual-class services and things like that. So I think that's possible. But to be fair and I want to see if Laura or Bob have a different view, I'm a little reluctant to guide you that way because I just don't feel like we have enough experience with that, and we're going to continue to make a lot of changes to their network. And again, I would use the word radical. There will be radical changes on an ongoing basis. Ultimately, I think it's going to look and feel like Southwest Airlines. It will just take us 24 months here to get through this transition process.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just on April, I wonder -- April looks like a modestly easier comp, Laura, so I wonder if you could give us any more detail in addition to the sort of slightly better than March's rate? And then how we should think about comps for the rest of the quarter? May for the industry, is it tougher comps? And maybe could you walk us through some of the history of May last year and why that was so much stronger.","Laura H. Wright","Yes, so certainly, where April, as I noted to date, is performing better on a year-over-year basis PRASM than what we reported for March. If we look at April alone, if you just look at it compared it to March on a sequential basis, you would expect April, on a nominal PRASM basis, to be down from March. And that's what we're seeing but it's right in line with historical expectations. If we have to guide you for March, we would say mid-to high single digits. I mean, April, I'm sorry, I'm getting my months turned around. I think beyond April, it's a little early to tell. But certainly, there's nothing that we're seeing in any of our bookings or trends that indicate anything that would be different sequentially just like we're seeing in April versus March. Excuse me, Gary or Bob, if you have anything you want to add?","Gary C. Kelly","Laura, I would agree with everything you said. And maybe just to say it a little bit different way. The first quarter performance, Duane, sequentially, compared to fourth, looked very normal to us. And if I remember correctly, we do have easier -- first quarter a year ago was pretty darn strong. Second quarter a year ago was a little off-trend. So I think if that's what you're suggesting, is that maybe we have some easier comps, that's possible. But in any event, what we do know, what's in the bank, so to speak, the first quarter performance was right in line with what we would have expected. We're not seeing some of the dramatic year-over-year increases that some of our competitors are, but a lot of that, I think, we earned -- that's in our more difficult comparisons. So we're up dramatically over a multi-year period. And feel very good about where our revenues are here, at least in the first quarter. And like all of us are saying, so far, April looks like it's more of the same, a little bit better.","Laura H. Wright","Before we take the next question, could I correct, make a correction from one of my statements with the audience?","Operator","Go ahead.","Laura H. Wright","Okay. I noted an increase in depreciation of $50 million. That is a full year 2012 impact, not second quarter.","Gary C. Kelly","That makes a difference.","Laura H. Wright","Yes. My apologies.","Operator","And we'll move on to Mr. Jim Parker with Raymond James.","James D. Parker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Looks to me like there are 2 very significant sources of earnings growth underway at Southwest. And the first, of course, is AirTran synergies, which you have broken out. Looks like those are on target. The other source is fleet modernization plus adding the 6 seats. Could you provide a bit of a timeline when we should be able to see those -- the positive impact become pronounced from those items that, I think, if we add all of those things together, where something like, I calculated, $0.38 from share from fleet modernization plus the 6 seats?","Laura H. Wright","We are getting that, Jim. Yes, so really no change to the numbers that we reported in our last quarter call. The real benefits start in 2013. We do expect to see some improvement in our 2012 earnings before tax. The estimate was around $70 million this year. Again, more weighted to the back half of the year because we're really not seeing the benefit of the additional seats yet as of both the 800s and the Evolve come in. In 2013, we'll have most of the Evolve in service for the full year, and the contribution to EBT for 2013 is expected to be in the $300 million-plus range. And then certainly, 2014, which is when we'll have a substantial number of 800s and have the Evolve retrofit complete, our forecast is EBT contribution in excess of $500 million.","James D. Parker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just looking at your RASM year-to-year growth, it is -- in this first quarter, it trailed the A-for-A RASM growth by 3 percentage points and trailed last year in the last 3 quarters by, looks like anywhere from 1 to 3 percentage points. Can you provide a little bit of insight? And this is for domestic, of course, A-for-A why Southwest lags the performance of the industry?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, beyond what I've already said, Jim, which is we have seen significant increases in our revenues in 2010 and 2009, especially. So we -- I would argue that we have harder comps. We've definitely seen stronger revenue growth compared to A-for-A over the last 3 to 4 years. The other thing I would quickly say is that we're still sub-optimized here between Southwest and AirTran. And until we get AirTran fully converted, fully merged, fully integrated into Southwest Airlines, that will be the case. So I'm sure there are some network inefficiencies, so to speak, that are in there that perhaps comparing to A-for-A on an ongoing basis, if we had it all merged together, we could probably do a better job of scheduling our network. But from a revenue management procedures and tools, we've made good progress over the last several years. We have more revenue management tools that are coming. And I think it will improve our ability to better manage our revenues, O&D revenue management in particular, something that is coming. And then the network inefficiencies, again, are simply a matter of having 2 separate brands that obviously we'll get that addressed as well.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, I recognized you're trying to manage a lot of complex changes at Southwest, and you've got a lot of strategic initiatives on the table. So if we accept sort of the view that you mentioned here just now, okay, we're of course sub-optimized and we've got the tools that are going to serve and improve the situation, when do you start to lose patience, though, with the inability of the company to kind of keep up with fuel? When do you say, like, we got to take a bolder action, whether it's a capacity cut, maybe we got to take a lead on fare increases? How much more patience do you sort of have? Is it a year because it's a 24-month integration? Or when do you sort of say, okay, that's it?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think it's premature to make that judgment today just because we do have so many things in progress that are all so promising. And looking back over the last 5 years, we've delivered against what we said we were going to do. So I feel very confident that the company will deliver. Just back to Laura's quick summary there on the fleet modernization, 6 more seats is 6 more seats, man. So there are just no way around it, and we're going to get more revenue as a consequence of that very modest incremental investment. So that will come. The new frequent flyer program, we are generating already hundreds of millions of dollars additional -- and it doesn't burn jet fuel. This is specifically related to our frequent flyer program. It is in deferred revenue awaiting those customer. So revenue benefit you'll see in the future with higher yields for free awards when they're flown compared to where we were with our R10 [ph]. So those are all very hard facts and will come along. The outlook that we have, as I mentioned to you, if you look at just March, April trends, they are very different than the story that you might get from the first quarter. And again, I would argue that the first quarter result this year weren't materially different than last year despite a $200 million increase in the fuel bill. So our outlook is good. We have a lot of opportunities to optimize our network, meaning, eliminating nonperforming flights with a lot of opportunities to redeploy that capacity as opposed to grounding capacity or cutting capacity. If we do reach the point where we need to cut capacity, obviously, we can do that. We can simply accelerate the retirements of our fleet and manage it that way. But no, I'm confident about our plan. And assuming fuel prices stay about where they are, we don't see some right turn in the economy, and I think we have a good outlook for the balance of 2012.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. So just as a follow-up to the last comment they made there about sort of changing some of that capacity if you need to or addressing some of the flights, 717s, are they sort of a problem here at this fuel price? We've seen regional jet challenges maybe it's starting to affect some of the smaller jets even at a mainline level?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I would certainly concede that they're not optimal. And I think that's simply affirming what I've said now for well over 1 year, which given these fuel prices, the 717 doesn't really bring any additional value to Southwest that a 737 can't. And arguably, it's not as good just because, if nothing else, it's just a more complication -- it's more complicated to have an additional fleet type. The fuel burn is good. The mission for the airplane is short haul, so it doesn't have the flexibility that a 737 has. But as long as one can schedule it that way, it works okay. Bottom line, on the economics, and Investor Relations can show you all this, they look fine. Would we rather have 137 seats going to 143 versus 117? Well, sure. And so we -- and therefore, we do have an effort underway to see if we can retire those aircraft from our fleet faster. But in the meantime, no, I don't think it's a matter of us making money or losing money because of the 717. That would be the wrong conclusion to reach. Can we better optimize our fleet? Absolutely, and that's what our objective is.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Most airline managements and clearly, the overwhelming majority of investors feel that American's standalone plan represents a clear and present danger to industry prosperity. I'm wondering if you have a view as it relates to Southwest on this topic?","Gary C. Kelly","Jamie, you're coming in very faint. I heard your question, so just redirect if I'm not on point answering your question. I think that at Southwest Airlines, the competition that we face in the future is different than the competition that we faced over the last decade. The fact that legacy carriers, including American, will be more cost-effective. And at least in some legacy carriers' cases, that's translated into profitability. That makes them more formidable competitors. So that doesn't really change our strategy per se, but it certainly imposes the right discipline on us. We've always taken the competition very seriously. We've always had an underdog mentality, and I do think that, that is the right outlook. You have a little bit different nuance to your question, and I realize that. I don't -- I'm simply answering your question from a perspective that I believe they will get their finances in order. They'll get their cost down, and they'll be a more formidable competitor because of that. You seem to be suggesting that your concern or there are concerns that they will now behave in a way that is damaging, and I don't have a comment on that. Whatever they do is what they're going to do, and we're simply preparing ourselves to have a more formidable competition in the future. We're doing that in several ways. We have initiatives to get our costs down. We have initiatives to become more fuel-efficient. We have initiatives to improve our customer experience and enhance the already glowing brand that we've earned. And we intend to win.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Excellent. And I'll speak up for my second question. Earlier today, you cited in an interview that I didn't catch, you cited some consumer pushback to higher fares. I'm wondering if you could add some detail. What sort of markets were you referring to? What sort of AP requirements? Is this long haul, short haul? Any additional granularity would help.","Gary C. Kelly","Jamie, it was more of a macro comment and acknowledging that our load factor was off 1 point compared to a year ago. And of course, you and I both know that 1 point isn't all that insightful. But after having multiple fare increases and being the expert airline at reducing fares and stimulating markets, we know that there's price elasticity and, obviously, a resistance to fare increases. So we do sense that -- and again, considering that this is the weakest season of the year, our customers were definitely shopping harder to get discount fares. And you can see that in our mix, which I think Laura reported on. So I don't know that I would extrapolate much from that. Whenever we can have unit revenue improvements of 5%, which is what our PRASM was, that's good. There's nothing wrong with our revenue production in that sense. I think the challenge, obviously, is that fuel prices demand more. So yes, I am concerned that we're seeing some consumer resistance, and I don't think that it really -- I don't think there's any more granularity that I can offer up. It feels to me like that's a systemic issue as opposed to some geographic region or length of haul issue.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions here. Laura, I want to go back to -- on the costs for the quarter. I mean, the numbers came in -- they came in very good. And I would say I think initially, you were targeting up 4% ex fuel. And I would say that, that was sort of where the guidance was even in early March, and I know you highlighted a couple of things that looked like that there were some good guys -- there's some stuff on lower revenue -- I mean, lower advertising expense, some stuff on labor. And some of that would seem to be that you would have known about that earlier in the quarter. You did mention some airport settlements. Were there any sort of good guys that maybe came in -- related to that that came in late in the quarter and helped that number?","Laura H. Wright","Yes, Mike, I mean, that's a fair question. Certainly, we were out in early March, I think around March 6 or so when we gave that guidance. We hadn't completely closed our books for February as well, but we did see improvement, more improvement in March. We saw some in February as well. But certainly, weather had a big impact on our labor costs, as well as just improved productivity. We really did as we saw energy prices go up. And we really put a call out to the field and all of our employees and leaders to respond, and they did. So our labor costs improved. We had a lot of savings in winterization because as we continued throughout the quarter, we continued to have really mild weather. Airports did improve in March as well. So I'm not sure -- and then advertising was actually less in March than we anticipated at that time as well.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then my second question, and I don't know if this is for Bob or maybe Gary, during this quarter, we did see for the first time, we had the opportunity where Southwest and AirTran were in some markets side by side. And I'm curious just from observing where -- like a market like in Atlanta to Chicago or in Atlanta to a Baltimore. What did -- and I realize it was only a few months. But did you notice any sort of a difference in behavior with customers realizing that some of the flights, there were charges for bag fees. Some of the flights didn't have the fees. Were you getting a revenue premium on the Southwest flights? I know you mentioned the fact that the response -- the customer response in Atlanta to the new flights was exceptional. Was it that the Southwest flights were a lot more profitable than the AirTran flights despite the fact that there are no bag fees? I mean, what can you tell us that you saw between the 2 products where they were operating in the same market?","Gary C. Kelly","Mike, let me give you my perspective, and then Bob can be the closer here on the question. First of all, the Southwest is operating 15 daily departures, something like that, and soon to go to 26. Those flights, we compare to a typical new city startup, and they are exceeding all of our pretty stout expectations. So we are really, really pleased with the subset of Southwest flights, so Southwest brand and everything you would expect. And we have a very successful launch of our service in Atlanta, and we're very warmly received in the community. And so all that, I would just grade as an A+. While we were doing that, we were also adjusting the AirTran flight schedule. So I don't remember the Chicago flights off the top of my head, but I did have, as an anecdote, Atlanta to Houston. And I've been spending some time in Houston, so I've got that anecdote in my mind. But we did reduce AirTran Houston flights in favor of adding Southwest flights. So in other words, in fairness to your question, we did help Southwest along where we could by pulling some AirTran capacity out. Moving over to the AirTran performance, AirTran's Atlanta performance is also improved versus a year ago, at the same time that we're introducing the Southwest service. They are different brands with different products, and we -- I'm sure that we have some customers who are challenging the difference in the brands, but it is certainly nothing that -- from a broader management perspective, it is not an issue. I'm very confident that we'll be able to get from here to fully integrated without any material problems. And most of it because of what Bob Jordan said earlier. The AirTran people are doing a phenomenal job of running that business unit, outstanding on-time performance, great customer service, #1 in baggage handling most months. So they're just continuing to do a terrific job. Bob, is there anything...","Robert E. Jordan","Well, Mike, I would just add, yes, the same thing. Where we have moved in overlap markets, we've moved out maybe a few AirTran flights in favor of Southwest. There are no noticeable changes. So the improvement year-over-year in AirTran, the improvement year-over-year in Southwest is showing up in those markets. And then a good example would be some of the new international adds, and it's very early. We just started the Denver-Cancun, but we've got bookings in some of the others. Some of those flights are coming out of cities where AirTran has very little domestic presence. And even in that case, those new international AirTran flights are booking up pretty strong. So again, I think it's the AirTran people. It's putting the flights into the right markets, where we know there's going to be success. But we've not seen any -- in my mind, we've not seen any issue in being able to maintain the integrity of the AirTran service while maintaining the integrity of the Southwest service on those overlap markets.","Operator","And we'll go next to Glenn Engel with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. One, can you please give ASMs by quarter?","Laura H. Wright","Yes. Let me get those, Glenn. Can you ask your second question while...","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The second question I have is on -- when would you expect your computers to allow you to cross-sell AirTran? I think you pictured out sometime next year, but I wasn't sure what part of the year. And two, if you can't cross-sell, wouldn't that suggest that your revenue synergy target gets pushed out as well?","Gary C. Kelly","The target for, calling it, codesharing, for lack of a better description, was the first half of '12, and we pushed that to 2013. I'm not ready to give you a date yet because I don't have one that I'm confident in.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You won't even say first half of 2013?","Gary C. Kelly","I won't. It is a -- for several reasons. Number one, I can actually make a case that for business reasons, we may not want to codeshare sooner than later. We have 11 aircraft that are converting in 2012, and that will have minimal impact to the AirTran network. We will be converting roughly 60-some-odd aircraft next year, so that's where we'll really need the facilitation, if you will, of the codesharing to make that conversion from an AirTran market more rapidly to a Southwest market. The profit effect is probably negligible. There's no doubt that we'll pick up some revenues. But you're also going to -- because the brands are so different, you're going to confuse the brand. And we'll have to deal with fees that AirTran charges and on a codeshare itinerary, obviously, we're not going to charge a bag fee. So I don't know if it's $1 for $1 tradeoff there. But another way to think about it, Glenn, is to say if you were to challenge us and say how are you going to recover the $300 million worth of fees that AirTran collects, I would tell you that yes, I think that that will be a takeaway, and at least during this transition period, we'll make it up with codeshare. So on a net-net basis, I just don't believe you're going to see a material profit benefit. Finally, said a third way, the $400 million worth of synergies that we all keep talking about are not counting on a net benefit from codeshare. The benefit is from moving away from the AirTran brand to a pure Southwest brand, where there's a superior revenue performance. It is our priority, by the way, on technology, and our technology folks have done a phenomenal job of delivering on a whole list of projects. We've deferred this one. But our priority will be implementing the necessary technology to support international service. So that will be our top priority. What is now in place, and I'm very pleased with, of course, is the support for the 737-800 and the multi-fleet technology capabilities. So all that is in place, and we'll work hard to make hay out of all of those investments.","Laura H. Wright","Glenn, here's the ASMs by quarter. So for 2Q, our year-over-year ASMs will be down between 1% and 2%. For the third quarter, the ASMs will be down approximately 1%, and we currently expect 4Q to be flat with last year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a question for Laura on the cost side. I think last quarter, for 2012, you had said a modest CASM ex-fuel growth. Just curious, given the 2Q guidance, is that sort of the high watermark for year-over-year growth in ex-fuel costs? Or is that sort of carried through into the second half? Just any color there.","Laura H. Wright","Yes. No, I think the guidance that we gave for 2Q, which is low to mid-single digit, is in line with the full year guidance at this point, again, all of the -- I just gave the ASMs to Glenn. So with ASMs down in 2Q and 3Q, that certainly provides some pressure. We've got the fleet investments. But I would look at the full year similar to the guidance that I gave for 2Q.","Gary C. Kelly","And one thing about that is it's somewhat of a transition year for us. While some of the cost inflation that you're seeing in 2012, we can't fairly assign that to the AirTran integration, but it is related in a large degree to our fleet modernization. So these are some upfront costs. If you want to think about it that way, that will have very significant cost and revenue benefits in the future.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Are there very specific 800 implementation costs that sort of you hit upfront like ETOPS, et cetera, that we just don't -- I mean, is that the kind of thing you're talking about, just for clarity?","Laura H. Wright","I think it's not really. That's not material in terms of operating expenses. The cost of the Evolve retrofit is all expensed, and that's about $50 million for the full year of 2012. So that will be included in our maintenance line item, again, as a really quick payback, and that's going to come on the revenue line. And we also have some additional expense based on our decision to retire our classics earlier than we had previously planned. But again, the economics of the replacement aircraft with a better fuel burn and maintenance and so forth, it's a very good return. You're just seeing some of the costs to doing that hit in P&L.","Gary C. Kelly","Depreciation is an example.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. That subtly sounded like there's something else there.","Gary C. Kelly","I think they're all things you know, but it's just to acknowledge with you that there is some cost effect of that in '12. But of course, a lot of the fleet modernization, just to repeat what Laura just said, a lot of the fleet modernization efforts will result in lower cost as time goes by, lower fuel burn, lower maintenance cost, and so this is a bit of a transition year cost-wise on the fleet.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just quickly, I know there's a lot of change going on this year. In terms of how you're deploying capacity seasonally, is there anything sort of changing or anything, as you're going through the AirTran integration, that allows you to maybe move some things around seasonally in ways that you couldn't in the past? Then what would be the impediments to really sort of flipping airplanes around more through the year?","Gary C. Kelly","I think that's a terrific question. It's somewhat related to Bill Greene's question earlier. We definitely need more flexibility in our business. And today, we schedule the airline on a hard schedule, Monday through Thursday, and then there are variations on Friday, different schedule on Saturday, different schedule on Sunday. So we need more than that. And I think January, February, in particular, are challenging months, and we probably -- what we would like is to find some better scheduling technique for that seasonality. So the short answer to your question is we completely agree with you. We're a different airline today than we were 5, much less 10 years ago in terms of dealing with seasonality. We definitely have seasonal service. So there are city pairs that are scheduled some times of the year and not all year long. Orlando, in particular is probably the most dramatic, where we actually have -- unlike any other city in our system that I can think of, Bob, we have more flights on a Saturday than we have on other days of the week. So we're doing what you asked. We're just not doing as much as I would like. Some of that is capability-wise, and some of it is just the business judgment that we're not quite ready to be as radical as, perhaps, we could. But it's definitely something with fuel prices the way they are. You just can't afford to fly airplanes that aren't profitable. So we are definitely -- we definitely have the same mindset that you do.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Ray Neidl with the Maxim Group.","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Just 2 very general things I wanted to address, Gary. The first, I know you're still committed to  the no charge for baggage fees. You think it's revenue positive for the company. But it seems with some other airlines, the travelers have changed their behavior and they pack much lighter now, saving on fuel costs. I know you're very concerned about your fuel situation. Could that be another side of the benefit that you haven't really looked at yet?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, all of that may be true. If the bag still ends up on the airplane, it's just upstairs instead of downstairs. I don't know that it's a fuel savings, but if people bring less, I think that that is a credible argument. We've just made huge progress with our revenue production compared to the rest of the industry since they started charging for bags. I mean, the evidence here -- you're an analyst, go look. It is absolutely indisputable. So I think it gives us a significant competitive advantage. We've never had higher brand rankings and continuing -- obviously, we're continuing to invest in our customer experience so that we not only keep what we've earned but win more customers. I think we have a huge opportunity to win more business customers. So yes, you know that we're not wavering, Ray, on our desire to have no hidden fees. And again, I think that the evidence is very clear that that's revenue positive for us.","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And finally, broadly, with AirTran and Southwest and integration not happening fully to 2014, you will be doing some international routes with AirTran. And then with the Hobby situation, you've made it clear you want to start doing some international routes out of Hobby. Can you expand that? Are those 2 things, one, independent of each other? And Number two, would you expand international services beyond Hobby and AirTran routes and maybe even investigate trying to get the law changed so you could do international routes out of Love Field in Dallas and some other cities?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, on your last question, the answer is absolutely not. We've got an agreement that we will honor, so we would not do that with the right amendment. On the Hobby situation, I don't think you're thinking about it incorrectly. The only thing I wanted to share with you all today is I know that that topic is in the news, and it is a significant undertaking by Southwest and one that we think is important that the Hobby airport system proposal is that international service would be readied by 2015. So I think that, that answers your question. So AirTran, in other words, would not have an opportunity to serve Hobby internationally before that. The airport won't be ready. They need to build gates. They need to build an international facility. They need to have customs and all of that kind of stuff. And that's what Houston and their airport system are undertaking. So the airport has proposed that Hobby add international service. We've told them that we're very interested in that, and that work is underway. So AirTran would not be a player most likely in that whole discussion, if that makes sense to you.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom, and thank all of you for joining us today. And of course, if you have any follow-up questions, we are available this afternoon. Thanks, and have a great day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Ginger Hardage, Senior Vice President of Culture and Communications.","Ginger Hardage","Thank you, Tom, and we thank everyone for being on the call today. We'd like to now switch over and have questions from the news media for Gary, Laura or Bob. So if you would give the instructions for queuing up, that would be great.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now begin with our first question from Terry Maxon with the Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxon","Elaborate on the Amadeus contract, if you will. Can we presume that if the international capability works well for you, that this will become your new reservation provider for all reservations?","Gary C. Kelly","I'm a little reluctant to just say yes to that just because it's hard to anticipate what might happen, what might change over the next 3 years that would cause us to feel differently. But clearly, we're going to be going through a lot of effort with Amadeus to implement this module, if you want to think about it that way. And if it works well for us, we'll obviously take a very hard look at domestic. And we've admitted that. I mean, why go to all this trouble to work with Amadeus with the thought that you're not going to continue to do business with them in a broader way? So we're going to -- we're positioned where we can take advantage of that, and if things go well, then, perhaps, that'll be our decision.","Terry Maxon","All right. And will this capability work side by side with your existing system, or will they be, in effect, 2 completely different systems with no real talking between the 2 of them, your domestic and what Amadeus will provide for you on the international side?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, you know what a technology expert I am, Maxon, so I will step right out there. But it's -- one way or the other, it has to be integrated in with the rest of our systems. But I think it's safe to say that this piece will probably be set aside from our domestic reservation system. Is that fair, Bob? Do you want to clean that up?","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, Terry, obviously, they're all passenger records, and the systems have to talk. So there is a -- there'll be a period of time where Navitaire, which is the AirTran system, Sabre, which is our current RES platform and Amadeus, which will be the international platform, are all talking to each other. That's all contemplated in the plan. And obviously then, as we move on through the AirTran integration and then make our ultimate RSR decision, we'll be back to one system over a period of years here. But yes, they will talk to each other to pass passenger information back and forth, just to enable a really good customer experience for our international passengers.","Gary C. Kelly","And it should all be transparent to our customers.","Robert E. Jordan","Yes.","Terry Maxon","All right. It sounded kind of Rube Goldberg, but that's -- but everything at technology is beyond my ken, so...","Gary C. Kelly","We're both dinosaurs, Maxon.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jack Nicas with The Wall Street Journal.","Jack Nicas","Real quick first question. Pro forma net income for first quarter of 2012 -- for 2011. I didn't see that in the release today. Do you guys have that?","Laura H. Wright","Are you talking about combined income with AirTran?","Jack Nicas","Yes.","Laura H. Wright","Yes, it is not. So under GAAP rules, we only include the impact of AirTran from the date that we acquired them, which is May 2 forward. So the comparisons do not include prior year. Now, we do provide certain statistics that are on a combined basis, and I believe we go down the operating income on a combined basis, so we don't go down to net income. AirTran actually did not ever report their first quarter results last year. They were just in that period where because of the acquisition, they were never required to file a first quarter's 10-Q. But we got an operating income, which I believe I pointed out -- that was $86 million this year.","Jack Nicas","Right, I do see that.","Gary C. Kelly","Did you find that combined income statement?","Jack Nicas","Yes, I certainly have the combined statement with the operating income, but just without the net income, I feel like it's tough to make a true comparison.","Gary C. Kelly","But does the 10-Q will have something in addition to that?","Laura H. Wright","No, this is all you'll see. So, yes, so on Page 17, you can see that there was an operating loss at AirTran of $29 million. Now if you just want to go look at some of their performance prior to that, you will note that they have expenses below the operating loss line for interest expense and those types of things as well, which have never been reported.","Jack Nicas","Okay. Now we're hearing sort of that there may be some plans to lease some AirTran 717s to Delta Air Lines. Is there any truth to that?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, we don't comment on rumors. I think that, that one cleanly fits within the definition of a rumor. If you were listening to -- I just don't want to be repetitive for you, but if you listened to our analyst call, there's no secret that we are working hard to modernize our fleet, which is a euphemism for saying that we're retiring aircraft that we would prefer not to have in the fleet in lieu of replacing them with next-generation 737, either 800s or 700s. The 737 classics fall into that category as do the 717s. So we are in a retirement phase. Currently, we're retiring 737 classics. If we can find a home for the 717s, then we would -- assuming that we can reach the right economics, then we'll consider retiring those aircraft from our fleet earlier. Today, we have a fleet of 698 airplanes. 88 of those 698 are the 717s. So I'm sure you can quickly surmise that we would prefer to have all 737s. And 717 is a great airplane. Again, it certainly will do the mission for us. It's just a little bit more complexity to have a different fleet type, and we don't really get much benefit by having the unique 717. So in fairness to your question, we're certainly open to retiring the 717s from our fleet early.","Jack Nicas","Okay, understood. And just real quick, I believe some Atlanta flights that were converted to Southwest had to be converted back to AirTran recently. Could you just elaborate what happened there?","Gary C. Kelly","I think it's very simple. We are lining up several things. One is the physical conversion of airplanes. Obviously, for us to launch Southwest flights, we need airplanes in the Southwest configuration. For us, with our integration, it's more complicated than many airlines because our airlines are so different. So we're all coach. AirTran has business class. They assign seats. They charge fees. We don't. So there's a number of things that have to line up physically on the airplane side. Next, all of the technology that connects our 2 networks needs to line up with some of the conversions of these flights as well, and we have elected to defer both. We've elected to defer some of the airplane conversions to beyond 2012, and we've elected to defer some of this technology beyond 2012. Our priority, as we said earlier, is to get our international capabilities with Amadeus up and running, in particular, as well as launch the 737-800 flights.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kiah Collier with the Houston Chronicle.","Kiah Collier","Gary, I was hoping you could go into more detail about Southwest's campaign for the Hobby project. Just what exactly is the game plan, especially after the Houston City Council's kind of skeptical reaction this week to the study, showing that the project would be kind of an economic boon for the Houston region? From what I understand, you still have no lobbyist registered with the city. Is that part of the plan? Or what exactly is the plan?","Gary C. Kelly","What is our campaign plan?","Kiah Collier","Right, right. Just more details about what exactly you all are doing.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think we've got a pretty straightforward approach here, which is -- we are supportive of what the Houston Airport System has proposed. They have asked us if we would be willing to launch international service. And our whole focus is on Houston at this point, so we are working with the city council. We're working with the mayor. We're working with the airport to answer their questions. As you know, we have put forward our commitment to guarantee debt, if that's necessary, to issue bonds, to construct the new facilities. And you've obviously learned today that we've announced what our international technology solution is as well. So we're fully committed to launching international service in Southwest Airlines, number one. We would -- we see a wonderful opportunity to lower fares and add flights and destinations in Houston through Hobby airport, number two. And we are making ourselves available to answer whatever questions there might be to -- in order to launch that service. So we'll work hard to get our message out both with the city council, the mayor, the airport, but also with our customers and our fans in the Houston area just so they know what it is we're trying to accomplish so that we have their support.","Kiah Collier","Okay. Can you go into a little bit more detail, maybe this is a question for Bob, just about how international flights and service kind of are part of your future with AirTran, just how it fits into the division of a merged carrier in the future?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, right now, we have 9 international destinations at AirTran with just a handful of daily departures. So it's a relatively small component of AirTran. AirTran will wind down as a brand over the next several years, so by the time you get to 2015, AirTran is no longer relevant to the conversation. It will be all Southwest Airlines. And by that time, Southwest Airlines will be flying the international flights that AirTran had, that we choose to move over to Southwest. So nothing is guaranteed at this point. But from Southwest -- so at that point in time, we're talking about Southwest. So from our perspective, we see some wonderful opportunities to expand our domestic footprint in the 48 states beyond the borders and especially South, to Latin America. So we are -- and we see Houston as a wonderful opportunity to focus our international activities, at least in Texas. There are about 137 daily departures today at Houston Hobby. We're hopeful that we could add a dozen or 2 to that and serve international markets, at least that's, from this vantage point, what we're thinking about.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","I was wondering how long you want to or how long can you maintain the bag fees on AirTran given what you discussed about you can make up for it with incremental revenue from codesharing in the future.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, Kelly, certainly, for this year, it's -- again, AirTran's business is very solid. Their financial performance has actually improved versus a year ago. They're doing an outstanding job of serving our AirTran customers. These things can't be pieced apart. So they have a nice product. They have a nice brand. They have a fair structure that includes fees, and that will continue until it gets converted to Southwest Airlines.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press.","David Koenig","A real quick one. What is your current estimate of the percentage of your passengers who are business versus leisure? And then how is that number or ratio is changing if it is?","Gary C. Kelly","David, I think here -- I don't know that we can give you a real finite answer to that. But over -- so it's more -- over time, we see the trends pretty consistent. But I would put our business travel at no less than 35%, probably no more than 40%. And it's been there for quite some time. We're obviously very hopeful that -- we carry a lot of business customers, as I know you've heard me argue over the years just because we carry so many customers nationwide. So we're arguably the largest carrier in the United States of business travelers. But I do see an opportunity for us to win more, and that's why we've invested in an all new frequent flyer program and are investing in some of the other customer amenities that we've added. But I don't see that that number has changed.","Laura H. Wright","The only caveat is the AirTran mix is, I would argue, is less than that, and that's the opportunity that we have with the acquisition.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, thank you, Laura. So Dave, that's an important point. So that really is the Southwest business. AirTran, we're pretty confident that their business mix is probably less than 25%.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andy Compart with Aviation Week.","Andrew Compart","Just to clarify one thing quickly, and then I'll ask my question. But on the bag fee and the change fee, et cetera, at AirTran, it's going to be 24 months to have the Sabre conversion. So you're expecting the fees to remain in place until sometime in 2014, if I understand that how you're explaining it. But secondly, Gary, you said during the call, and I believe this was regarding AirTran's network, that there will be radical changes on an ongoing basis. And I'd like to see more clarity on what you mean by radical changes. What are you foreseeing there? And what areas do you see these changes, and what will make them radical?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, without attempting to be too colorful, it's really just -- and that's not a new statement. We're changing our routes. We're changing cities. We're adding and subtracting -- there's just -- what you have with AirTran today is not what you're going to have with those airplanes when they're integrated into Southwest Airlines. So it'll be a very different route network. If nothing else, the hub-and-spoke system that they currently operate in Atlanta, we won't do that. We'll have our typical point-to-point network established, and we've already laid the groundwork for that with the Southwest Airlines' launch. But AirTran has already announced that it's closing 15 locations this year, as one example to what I was referring to. And that capacity, they're very small cities in operations. But there is capacity that becomes available as a consequence of that, and that's what Bob Jordan was reporting earlier, that they're redeploying those flights to new international destinations that we think will be very successful for us. So we're opening up Cabo San Lucas on AirTran, Mexico City on AirTran and connecting -- and also, I guess adding some new U.S. cities to those international destinations. Orange County, California is a new city for AirTran as is Austin, Texas. And those will be serving our international markets. San Antonio, I believe, for the first time, will also be getting international AirTran service, and that's Cancun, Mexico City. So a lot -- I consider that to be pretty radical. But again, when this is all done in 2014, then it'll be a very different route system for these 140 airplanes.","Andrew Compart","Okay. And the bag fee is until 2014?","Gary C. Kelly","AirTran will have bag fees. So as long as AirTran is out there marketing as AirTran, it will have its business class, its fare structure, its fee structure.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question today. And we'll take our last question is from Rich Rovito with The Business Journal Milwaukee.","Rich Rovito","Gary, just with all the changes that are happening in Mitchell Airport here in Milwaukee, specifically Frontier's decision to scrap its hub operation here, currently, AirTran and Southwest now have about 50% of the market share at Mitchell. But what are your thoughts on the Milwaukee market? And is Frontier's decision to essentially drastically cut service here open up some more opportunities for AirTran and Southwest?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I'm excited about Milwaukee. I think Milwaukee is a wonderful city, and I was delighted when we finally made the decision to serve Milwaukee. I think that was in 2009, and we've had great success since then. The acquisition of AirTran obviously accelerates the Southwest brand in that market by the time we get to 2014. So we're very excited about that. Milwaukee is a great market. San Antonio is an example. It's one of our original Southwest cities, and we have about 50 daily departures in San Antonio. So I have every reason to believe that Milwaukee will be at least that. So we are obviously mindful of what our competitors do in the market. Clearly, if they pull flights out, that gives us an opportunity to consider expanding. It requires more research than just a casual view, though, because we all don't serve the same cities. But clearly, if we have competitors that pull out of our city pair markets, that's an opportunity for us to quickly win more customers. And we'll do our best to serve your community very well.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over for any additional or closing remarks.","Ginger Hardage","Well, great. Thank you so much, everyone, for being on the call today. We're sorry we ran out of time.

My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Martinez","Thanks, Chad, and thank you all for joining us. I know it\u2019s a busy airline earnings day. But we\u2019re going to start out with prepared remarks from Gary Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO. And then we\u2019ll open it up for Q&A.","A few quick disclaimers before we get started here. We will make forward-looking statements in our remarks, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and of course, our actual results could differ from current expectations for a number of reasons. We called out special items in 2018, and we will make reference to 2019 results that compare to prior year non-GAAP results.","Both of these topics are covered in great detail, as always, in our earnings release disclosures as well as on our IR website. And we are also providing commentary today regarding the ongoing MAX groundings and our current estimations of time lines and current planning assumptions for 2020. Keep in mind, these time lines and estimations could change materially with impacts on the amount of financial damages we incur, our published flight schedule beyond June 6 and our fleet capacity and CapEx assumptions, to name a few.","With all of that said, we\u2019ll go ahead and get started, and I\u2019m turning over the call to Gary.","Gary Kelly","Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end 2019 earnings call. Straight away, I want to thank our employees. This is our 49th year, and they\u2019re \u2013 at least in my experience, there is no more remarkable year than 2019. The grounding of effectively 75 of our airplanes, which is about 10% of our fleet presents a crisis-like challenge. And our people were ready work with the best planning tools and technologies in our history, but more importantly, with the right fortitude and the right resolve to get through this crisis.","Our objectives were to run a great airline, serve our customers exceptionally well, protect our finances and our jobs and follow through with our capital projects that were underway. And we were able to do all those things. The MAX groundings reduced our annual operating income of $828 million. Our earnings were still a record on a per share basis, non-GAAP basis, at $4.27. And that is truly remarkable. But they would have been 28% higher and 20% \u2013 27% more than a year ago but for the MAX. You can do the math on the stock price effect, but we settled with Boeing for the 2019 MAX groundings, and the settlement seems to have zero effect on the price per share, by the way. But we also intend to settle up 2020 as well.","So we\u2019re three months later since our last earnings call, and unfortunately, we\u2019re still talking about the MAX unhappily. I\u2019m confident about the MAX. More importantly, our pilots are confident about the MAX. Boeing needs to get the work done and get the certification flight done, give the FAA a chance to do their work and unground this airplane. But right now, we\u2019re scheduled for a June 6 return, which implies an ungrounding several months before Boeing surprised us all this week with their June, July predictions about the ungrounding. And obviously, that would make our and other airlines\u2019 June dates unworkable. So the timing remains uncertain, and we\u2019re working through all of that right now.","Our goals for 2020, given all of this, are very straightforward. We want to return the MAX to service. We want to continue to run a great operation, in fact, even better. We want to continue to serve our customers very well with exceptional hospitality, and in fact, even better. We want to protect our finances and our jobs and continue to keep costs low and slow the rate of inflation and do that even better. We want to settle with Boeing for 2020 compensation. We want to continue on with the capital projects that are underway. And then finally, we want to keep our network intact and continue making what modest tactical adjustments we\u2019re able to do.","Having said all those things and all assumed that demand and the economy remains strong and that the oil prices remain stable and low, if we can continue to execute against all these goals, that means that we only have one problem, and that\u2019s fleet growth. So with regard to the fleet, we\u2019re assuming that the MAX grounding is short-lived, meaning there are months to go and not years to go.","And with that in mind, we are aggressively pursuing a couple of tactical ideas. Number one is mainly our 700 retirement schedule where we have a lot of flexibility. So we\u2019re actively deferring retirements where it makes sense.","Secondly, we\u2019re always monitoring the used 737 aircraft market. We\u2019ll continue to do that. Our issue is simple. It is our seat growth is not keeping up with demand, much less allowing us to expand. And we\u2019re losing share, but all that is temporary, and we plan to aggressively recapture it once the MAX is ungrounded and are in a superb position, given our return on invested capital.","There is no change in our efforts to evaluate the risk\/reward of a single aircraft type or supplier. We\u2019ll do that. It\u2019s just a lower 2020 priority, so there\u2019s no update there. I\u2019ll also preempt the M&A question by repeating what I\u2019ve said earlier: I do not agree that the MAX crisis compels us to acquire another carrier. We would not overpay. We would not commit us to a course that\u2019s inconsistent with our strategy. And of course, as is our policy, we do not comment on rumors or speculation, about any M&A activity.","And then finally, I want to thank our Board for making an amendment for our 2019 profitsharing. And even though the Boeing compensation is for 2019, it is not included in 2019 profits. And that\u2019s not fair to our people for their profitsharing. So as a result of that, $124 million was added. And of course, that reduced our fourth quarter profits, but that makes the total annual profitsharing contribution a record $667 million. And our folks earned it, and I just wanted to congratulate them. So taking that notable item into account, we beat consensus.","So with that quick overview, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mr. Van de Ven to take us through our operations.","Mike Van de Ven","Well, thanks, Gary. And as Gary was mentioning, given all of our headwinds that we were facing, it was extremely important that we run a reliable customer-friendly operation in the fourth quarter. And our people certainly delivered. They produce the best overall operation we\u2019ve had in over a decade. Our system-wide on-time performance for the fourth quarter was 82.4%, and we accomplished that with the least amount of block and turn time in the industry.","And that\u2019s a big factor in our operational efficiency that lowers our cost through superior aircraft utilization. It\u2019s the low cost coupled with the great service that allows us to win. On the service front, this was the first quarter where we had bag scanning implemented throughout our domestic network. We emplaned 30.9 million bags in the quarter, and 99.6% of those bags were carried on flights as checked. That is a record fourth quarter performance for Southwest Airlines. And our customers noticed. Through November, Southwest, again led the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratios reported by the DOT. And based on our preliminary December results, we expect to close out the year in a similar fashion.","And frankly, our people have been delivering this kind of exceptional service the entire year and all the while dealing with the significant activities associated with the MAX grounding. So in that environment, we grew our Hawaii service to over 1 million customers in just 9.5 months. We implemented plane-side scanning for bags across the domestic network, and we continue to implement technology enhancements across all of our operating and functions.","So for all of 2019, excluding Hawaiian Airlines, Southwest finished in the top three in the industry in on-time performance and bag handling and with the lowest customer complaint ratio, all as measured by the DOT. And that\u2019s the best combined yearly industry performance since 1999. And our people believe that they can improve from there. Through yesterday, our January on-time performance was 87.7%. That is just a superb start to the year. It\u2019s one of our best.","In fact, we\u2019ve only achieved an 85% January on-time performance or better five times since 1988. And it\u2019s the on-time performance that sets the foundation for bag handling, for customer complaints and for cost control. There\u2019s no better team in this industry than our Southwest people. And they support our customers, our company, each other, and they are just relentless in execution. And they are the heart and the soul and the spirit of Southwest.","So turning to the MAX for a moment. Our guiding principle of relaunching this aircraft continues to be an orderly and controlled manner, one which we can execute with a high degree of confidence and certainty. And that\u2019s been a critical focal point for our team, and we planned and we\u2019ve replanned our return to service activities as new information becomes available. So since the beginning of the year, we have learned of two significant additional considerations: first, the Boeing recommendation for both simulator and CBT training for our pilot prior to their operation of the airplane; and then secondly, Boeing\u2019s most recent estimate of a mid-2020 return to service date.","As you know, we have presently removed all MAX flying from our schedules through June 6. And with this new information, it seems pretty clear that we\u2019re going to need to make further schedule adjustments into the summer. So we\u2019re replanning yet again using the best set of facts and insights and all the necessary activities, and we\u2019ll make the appropriate adjustments well in advance so that our customers\u2019 travel plans aren\u2019t significantly disrupted.","We have 34 MAX aircraft on our operating certificate. They\u2019re in Southwest Airlines\u2019 control, and they\u2019re stored in Victorville, California. Those aircraft must go through maintenance and make-ready work before they\u2019re ready for service. We also have 27 MAX aircraft that Boeing has built, and they\u2019re being stored by Boeing until the aircraft are certified to fly. Those 27 must still go through the delivery and acceptance process in addition to any make-ready work to be added to the Southwest Airlines operating certificate. Those combined 61 aircraft are our most reliable source of lift once the aircraft is cleared to fly.","And as I\u2019ve stated in earlier calls, we believe that we can manage around 5 to 10 aircraft a week from this collective pool to be reintroduced to the operation. So it will take at least a couple of months for those aircraft to return to service. And our crewing is in place today to operate them. Boeing still contractually owes us 51 more aircraft this year. That\u2019s the 2019 carryover plus the 2020 deliveries. And with our production line shutdown, the delivery quantities and the dates are in flux. We\u2019re going to continue discussions with them to work through what\u2019s reasonable for both of us as their plans become better defined.","So turning to training. Our initial training plans included the 30-day period for all of our pilots to complete the expected CBT training before we begin flying the aircraft and revenue service. Boeing is now recommending the additional simulator training. And the training requirements will be finalized at a later date after the JOEB completes their testing. These requirements will dictate the time it takes for us to complete our pilot training. We currently have three MAX sims on property, and we have worked with our simulator manufacturer, CAE, to provide us with three additional MAX simulators to be training-ready before the summer.","That will give us at least six MAX simulators available for training by the time the aircraft is released to fly, and that will significantly reduce our training time from where we started. Beyond these six, we have three more simulators deliveries planned for the second half of 2020, and we\u2019re working on expected in-service dates for them. That will close 2020 for us with nine MAX simulators. I cannot thank CAE enough for their partnership and support. We have had a strong relationship with them for many, many years, and they have helped create one of the leading flight ops training centers in the world.","Assuming for a second that the simulator training maybe two hours, this as a baseline, it will take us at least a couple of additional amounts from where we were to get all of our pilots through that training. So there\u2019s still a lot of moving parts to nail down the return-to-service plan. The FAA is in control of the regulatory ungrounding process, and our plans begin once they clear the aircraft to fly. From that date, we\u2019re assuming it will take several weeks to get our manuals updated and our CMO to approve our changes. And then once that is accomplished, we can begin training our pilots and bringing the aircraft into their operational state.","And as I mentioned, it will take at least a couple of additional months before the aircraft are ready for revenue service and our pilots are trained. In the meantime, we still plan on performing extensive validation flights to work out any effects of the aircraft for sitting so long to also reintroduce them to our people and to make sure that we are completely comfortable with the aircraft performance before any customer set foot on the aircraft.","Wrapping up, our operation is running very, very well. We have a detailed plan to relaunch the MAX, and we\u2019ll be adjusting it as we get better information. Our people are taking great care of our customers and each other, and they\u2019re delivering a safe, reliable product. They are the best team that I have ever been around. And it is a pleasure to support them.","And with that, over to you, Tom.","Tom Nealon","Okay. Thank you, Mike. I just really have to echo Mike and Gary and also share my congratulations and my thanks to all of our employees. They are absolute warriors, and they are Southwest heros. 2019 was a very challenging year with the MAX, but we also had a great year. We really did have a great year in our people across every work group just kept rising to the challenge time and time and time again. When the MAX was grounded, as Gary said, in March of last year, we were very clear about our priorities. First, we are absolutely committed to running a great operation. We\u2019re absolutely focused on taking great care of our customers. And third, we are very focused on delivering very strong financial results. And we did all three. And we did it very, very well.","As Mike said, the operation was rock solid, arguably the best operation in a decade. Also, as Mike said, our DOT customer sat score is at the very top of the industry. And what I didn\u2019t say is, keep in mind, that\u2019s the year when we had to proactively re-accommodate, literally, millions of customers. And our brand scores also remain the highest in the industry and among the highest in the world for any company, not just airlines. So the customer service and the hospitality that we\u2019re so famous for is stronger than ever, and our people just continue to take great care of our customers and one another.","So our fourth quarter RASM results were right in line with our original October guidance of flat to up 2%. Our fourth quarter revenue grew 40 basis points to a record of $5.7 billion, and that was despite a nearly 1% decline in capacity. And we also grew our RASM 1.3%, which is also a record performance. Our base business was very strong and was the driver of our Q4 RASM performance. This was really the result of strength in both demand and yield. We also had very strong performance in our other revenues. More specifically, our Rapid Rewards program performed very well, which I\u2019ll talk about more in just a minute. We also had very strong performance from our early bird and upgraded boarding products, both of which had double-digit growth in the quarter.","Now as I said on our third quarter call, we made the decision in the fall 2019 to republish our November and December schedules, really with two objectives in mind. First, we want to minimize any customer disruption and inconvenience during the holiday travel season. And second, we wanted to ensure that we ran a great operation with lower capacity.","And we achieved both objectives, but we also knew that we weren\u2019t optimizing RASM for the peak versus off-peak seasonality in the fourth quarter. And as expected, the two to three points of temporary year-over-year RASM benefit that we saw in the third quarter from the removal of the MAX didn\u2019t occur in the fourth quarter because of the suboptimized Q4 schedules. Now none of that was a surprise to us. The net effect of this is that there was no material year-over-year MAX impact to Q4 RASM, which, again, is what we expected and shared with you on the last call.","And I got to say, once again, our network planning team just did a phenomenal job of developing workable solutions to protect the strength of our network and to minimize customer disruption. And the same call out to our revenue management team, did an equally incredible job of managing the revenue and yields throughout the quarter. We also had very strong revenue growth in our other revenues. Our Rapid Rewards program continues to perform extremely well.","For the full year, our other revenue grew nearly 11%. In the fourth quarter, performance was a strong 9% growth. And we\u2019re continuing to see record passenger mix continued \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re seeing the reward pass-through mix continue to grow, which really speaks to the strength and the value of the program for our customers.","Now we\u2019re also continuing to see very strong growth in spending on our co-brand credit cards. And the sheer size and growth of our credit card portfolio is very healthy with nearly double-digit growth and very low attrition. So we continue to be very pleased with the economics in the structure of our program, as well as with our partnership with Chase.","So to sum up Q4, the bottom line is very simple, very steady, strong demand for both leisure and business, continued strength in pricing, strength in our other revenues and continued industry leading strength in our customer and brand scores. The story line for Q1 is very similar to what we experienced in Q4. The underlying trends around demand and pricing that we experienced in Q4 have continued into Q1.","Everything that we\u2019re seeing for the quarter shows very solid shopping and bookings. So demand remains solid for both leisure and business travel and pricing also remain steady and strong. So we have a very good read on first quarter revenue in RASM trends. Obviously, we continue to be impacted by the MAX, we pulled the MAX out of our April schedule, which runs through June 6. And as you know, March is the peak month in the first quarter and our MAX aircraft deficit grows from 34 aircraft in March of 2019 to roughly 60 aircraft short by March of 2020.","Now that said in Q1, we don\u2019t have the flight schedule variations in the capacity and demand mismatch complications that we have in the fourth quarter. So because of that, we expect a 2-point year-over-year RASM benefit in Q1 from the MAX cancellations. We also have roughly 0.5 point year-over-year RASM tailwinds in the first quarter from prior year negative impacts, 1 point due to the government shutdown and 0.5 point due to the unscheduled maintenance cancellations in Q1 of last year.","So based on the strength of our base business as well as the Q1 MAX RASM impact in the year-over-year tailwinds, we expect a strong Q1 RASM performance in the range of up to 3.5% to 5.5%. I\u2019ve said this before, but I think it\u2019s worth repeating as we continue adjusting the flight schedules for MAX cancellations, our focus is to maintain depth and frequency of service to key markets. And we\u2019re also very focused on maintaining a high degree of point-to-point direct flying, as well as maintaining high quality connecting itineraries.","Now when you look at our schedule, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve trimmed some capacity from longer haul markets and we\u2019ve added more capacity into our short and medium haul flying, which is a real core strength of our network.","Just to be clear, in no way, we\u2019re walking away from long haul flying, but with the MAX out of service, we have opportunities to replace profitable, but below system average RASM, long haul, non-stop itineraries with high quality connecting itineraries. We will do that. And with the strength of our point to point network, we have the flexibility to do that.","Now, once the MAX returns to service, we\u2019ll certainly restore the vast majority of flights that have been taken out of our schedules and we\u2019ll do so in a way that lines up their operations and commercial objectives. We have the world\u2019s largest and strongest point-to-point network and we intend to leverage our cost structure and our scale and we certainly intend to resume our growth. And we tell you, we have a long runway of growth opportunities still in front of us.","Now despite the MAX cancellations, we\u2019ve continued to add additional flights into some of our key markets. We have near-term growth focus will continue to be in Baltimore, Denver, Houston, Hawaii. Hawaii continues to perform very well from both long haul and interisland markets and this is totally consistent with our plans and our expectations.","Now looking beyond Q1, obviously, our 2020 growth will be determined by the MAX return-of-service. Until that occurs, we\u2019ll just continue to adjust our plans accordingly. And our objectives are no different than what they were in 2019. We\u2019ll run a great operation. We\u2019ll take great care of our customers and we\u2019ll deliver strong financials.","And as Mike alluded to, if we need to make further adjustments to our June schedule, which runs from June 7 through early August, we\u2019ll do so. And that would like to include further trends to our non-stop long haul flights and potentially a modest thinning of high-frequency markets, which is essentially the same playbook that we\u2019ve been running for the past several schedules.","We also have a full pipeline of revenue and cost initiatives, most of which we won\u2019t discuss yet for competitive reasons. But I can tell you that we\u2019re on track to implement our new GDS capabilities for corporate travel by mid-year with Travelport and Amadeus, which we expect to drive incremental EBITDA between $10 million and $20 million in the second half of 2020 and there\u2019s clearly a very large opportunity to grow that substantially over the next several years.","So that\u2019s where we are. Q1 is off to a strong start. Trends remain strong and we\u2019re guiding our RASM to be up 3.5% to 5.5%. And once the MAX return-to-service, we are ready to bring it back into service with all the operational and commercial discipline that you would certainly expect in Southwest Airlines.","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Tammy.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Tom, and hello everyone. I\u2019d also like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts managing through a very challenging year. The MAX grounding have had a significant impact on our company, but our employees continue to rise to the occasion and the strong results we reported this morning simply would not have been possible without their hard work and incredible focus and teamwork.","With the MAX return-to-service timeline shifting frequently, it has been difficult to anchor our full year 2020 forecast to support meaningful guidance for the full year. So I\u2019ll focus primarily on first quarter guidance and my comments today regarding our cost performance, fleet capacity and CapEx plans, and our strong financial position.","During fourth quarter, as a Gary of covered, we reached a confidential agreement with Boeing for compensation related to 2019 financial damages due to the MAX groundings. The compensation from Boeing will be accounted for as a reduction of the purchase price of our 31 owned MAX aircraft and future MAX from orders, which reduces property and equipment on our balance sheet and will result in lower depreciation expense over the useful life of the aircraft.","In light of this agreement, our Board of Directors authorized a $124 million pre-tax profitsharing award. This incremental award was accrued in fourth quarter and reduced fourth quarter earnings by $97 million or $0.18 per diluted share as we covered in the release. A record $264 million in fourth quarter profitsharing expense included a $124 million discretionary award and will be paid later this quarter as part of the record $667 million full year 2019 profitsharing distribution to employees.","So now that I\u2019ve covered profitsharing, I\u2019ll go ahead and cover fuel costs before I move into our cost performance, excluding fuel and profitsharing. Our fourth quarter fuel price of $2.09 per gallon, decreased $0.16 or 7.1% year-over-year, and that\u2019s primarily due to a roughly an 8% decrease in market prices. We have a great fuel hedging protection in place this year with a 66% hedge for first quarter and 59% hedge for full year 2020.","We\u2019ve been adding some protection to future years and are currently about 54% hedge for 2021 and about 31% hedge for 2022. We also recently began adding modest protection to 2023 and expect to continue our systematic approach to building a meaningful multi-year hedging portfolio at a reasonable cost to provide some insurance on around what\u2019s about a third of our cost structure.","For our first quarter 2020, based on market prices as of January 17, we expect our fuel price to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 per gallon with a modest $0.01 hedging gain at current prices.","Our fuel efficiency continues to be significantly impacted by the MAX groundings. We came into 2019 expecting a solid year-over-year improvement in our fuel efficiency, largely driven by the operating performance of the 75 MAX aircraft we should have had in 2019. As a reminder, the MAX produces a 20% fuel burn improvement over our retired classic fleet and a 14% improvement over our NG fleet.","However, our fourth quarter and full year 2019 ASMs per gallon declined 0.8%. So we lost some ground last year. We\u2019ll continue to be impacted until the return of the MAX in first quarter 2020 ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year-over-year in the range of down 2% to 3%.","We look forward to reversing this trend and getting back on track with our fuel efficiency improvement goal. Excluding fuel and profitsharing, the 5% year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter CASM-Ex was right in line with our most recent guidance. And as we outlined in our release, the primary driver of the year-over-year increase was the temporary underutilization of overhead combined with the lower than planned capacity from the MAX grounding.","For full year 2019, our CASM-Ex increased 7.7% year-over-year. The MAX grounding impact drove approximately 5 points of this year-over-year inflation, which is what we expected. Excluding the MAX impact, our cost control was very solid with core year-over-year 2019 unit cost performance, slightly below our original CASM-Ex guidance range of 3% to 3.5%. And that includes the incremental $10 million of maintenance expense to keep seven of the -700 aircraft that we were originally going to retire in 2019, as well as the incremental $42 million ratification true up for mechanics contract.","Looking at first quarter 2020, we expect our CASM-Ex to increase in the 6% to 8% range year-over-year. Our outlook includes an estimated 7-point unit cost penalty from the MAX grounding as our fleet deficit grows relative to our cost base. We will continue to have temporarily unabsorbed overhead that will be utilized upon the MAX return-to-service.","Setting the MAX aside, our first quarter CASM-Ex outlook also includes 1 to 2 points of inflation, primarily due to increases in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and operating expenses related to technology and facility investments. As you know, we have year-over-year tailwinds related to the first quarter 2019 impact associated with the ratified labor agreement with our mechanics and cost associated with unscheduled maintenance disruptions and flight cancellations, which offset inflationary pressures here in the first quarter.","Turning to an overview of our fleet plan, this has obviously been a focus for us this year with the MAX grounding. So I\u2019ll spend a little more time walking you through all the moving parts. Prior to the MAX groundings, our 2019 plans were for 44 MAX deliveries. That was 37 MAX 8s and seven MAX 7s along with 18 -700 retirement. This would have resulted in a fleet of 776 at year-end 2019. Instead, we had three MAX 8 deliveries plus six -700 retirements, and therefore, ended 2019 with a total fleet of 747 aircraft.","We took delivery of three 737 MAX 8 aircraft in first quarter before the MAX groundings in mid-March. We have not taken any delivery since then and as a result we decided to postpone seven of the 18 planned retirements for 2019 to help mitigate a portion of our fleet deficit.","We\u2019ll operate these seven aircraft for around two more years and they are scheduled retired by the end of 2021. As the remaining 11 -700 retirement plan for 2019, we retired six of them, one in third quarter and five during fourth quarter.","The remaining five retirements have shifted to first half 2020. We have not updated our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing. The 41 MAX aircraft that we didn\u2019t receive in 2019 are still in flux. But in our contractual order book schedule shown in our earnings release this morning, we reflected 40 of those deliveries as part of our 2020 firm orders and one as a 2021 firm order.","However, I will provide some context as far as our current planning assumptions, because we do not expect to receive 78 aircraft deliveries at this point in 2020. The news from Boeing two days ago that the MAX will likely not return-to-service until mid-2020 has us now reevaluating our fleet and capacity plans further.","Mike has already taken you through some of the details of our MAX return-to-service plan and he referenced the two sources of MAX aircraft that we are currently focused on as part of our 2020 fleet planning assumptions.","Mike is working through the plan to safely return the 34 MAX 8s already in our fleet. We will also be working with Boeing and the FAA to deliver the 27 MAX 8 aircraft that are built-in in storage.","At this juncture, our current planning scenario is for 27 MAX deliveries in 2020. That brings us to around 60 MAXs, which we are currently staffed to operate. We also expect to retire 16 -700 aircraft this year. The five that shifted from 2019 and 11 more planned throughout the year.","This is less than the 20 to 25 that we previously communicated and that\u2019s simply due to the slower assumed ramp up of MAX production and delivery catch-up. We will invest approximately $12 million this year into those 11 aircraft that we\u2019re extending for a few years. Based on our planning assumption that I walked through, we would add a modest 11 net aircraft to our fleet in 2020 at 758 total aircraft.","Of course, we don\u2019t have certainty on the timing of the MAX return-to-service, that production timeline from Boeing or our aircraft delivery timeline. So this is all subject to change and we\u2019ll keep you updated accordingly.","Shifting to capacity. Fourth quarter 2019 ASM declined 0.9% year-over-year, which as expected was about 8 points lower than our original plan. Our full year 2019 capacity declined 1.6% year-over-year and was significantly lower than our original plan to grow nearly 5% in 2019.","For first quarter 2020, we currently expect our ASM capacity decline in the range of down 1.5% to 2.5% year-over-year. We currently have MAX flying removed through June 6, but with Boeing\u2019s latest guidance, we\u2019ll likely extend our MAX related flight adjustments further. So based on the flight schedule adjustments through June 6, we expect second quarter 2020 capacity to increase no more than 2%.","So now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with robust cash and short-term investments of approximately $4.1 billion. Our cash balance continues to be higher than what we usually carry as we haven\u2019t been making aircraft delivery payments since mid-March 2019. Delayed delivery payments also lowered our CapEx to $1 billion in 2019 versus our original plan of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. The majority of the 2019 spend related to technology and facility investment.","And we also received $400 million in supplier proceeds, which we consider an offset to our capital expenditures. For 2020, if you assume we get the 27 MAX 8s from Boeing, that are already built for us, that would result in total CapEx of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which is net of a supplier proceeds owed to us at year-end. 2019.","Our cash flow generation in 2019 was very strong, despite the $828 million operating income reduction due to the MAX groundings. During 2019, we generated $4 billion in operating cash flow and a record $3.4 billion in free cash flow with $2 billion of share repurchases and $372 million in dividends.","We have $1.35 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, net of the $550 million accelerated share repurchase currently underway that is expected to wrap up no later than mid-February. We have very healthy cash and liquidity, low leverage, manageable debt obligations this year and remain focused on a balanced approach to investing in our employees and the company and returning cash and value to our shareholders.","In closing, I\u2019d like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees. Taking into consideration, the significant impact the MAX grounding had on our operational and financial performance. Our 2019 results were truly superb. We did not lose ground on our very strong financial position, maintaining our investment grade balance sheet, ample liquidity, strong cash flows and healthy shareholder return.","And we also continue investing in our business and we\u2019re well positioned for the future. Absent the impact of the MAX groundings in first quarter of 2019 unique items, we achieved our unit revenue growth goal of greater than 3% for 2019. Likewise, we beat our unit cost guidance for 2019, which is just tremendous.","Of course, the MAX did significantly impact 2019 and 2020 will also be significantly impacted by the ongoing MAX situation, but our focus on solid execution remains unchanged. We look forward to getting past these near-term challenges and temporary headwinds, safely returning the MAX to commercial service and leveraging our low cost and robust route network to resume our growth.","So with that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for the questions. Tammy, it seems like you were able to offset the 1 to 2 points of inflationary pressures in 1Q partially due to some of the easier comps, I think, partially due to maybe some of your cost initiatives that you have. But going forward, do you think you have a similar ability, the rest of the year, which would allow you to keep \u2013 I guess, do you think you have a similar ability or the rest of the year to continue to offset these cost pressures and keep it more contained to what the MAX impact is? Or do you think inflation will continue to ramp over the course of the year? Thanks.","Tammy Romo","Thanks for your question, Andrew. So yes, we certainly have abnormal capacity trends this year again. But as we drill down into our core costs and strip out the estimated impact of the MAX grounding and all the other noise, we do see core business unit cost inflation in that, call it, close to 2% range. That said, we don\u2019t know exactly when the MAX will return, and our second half 2020 capacity plan is very much in flux. So again, that\u2019s our best read at this point. We\u2019ve reported our analysis of the unit cost impact each quarter from the MAX groundings.","So along those lines, we\u2019ve done our best to get a sense of what our true CASM-Ex run rate is from 2019 to 2020. So normalizing for the MAX and the other unique items for both 2019 and 2020, we believe we could have reached our CASM-Ex year-over-year growth in 2020 of less than 2%, which is in line with the goals. But admittedly, we have a lot of moving parts try to tease out.","So I guess, in summary, I\u2019d just say, I\u2019m very pleased with how we executed against our cost plan in 2019, and we are very focused on being even more efficient. So I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume or think we should be able to improve our trajectory here in 2020 relative to 2019, excluding the MAX. But just again, including the MAX, obviously, the year-over-year comparisons are very skewed, and we\u2019re incurring costs that we didn\u2019t expect such as extending retirements and incurring the related maintenance investment and have some timing items such as deferring flight crew hiring from 2019 into 2020, et cetera.","But overall, I\u2019m just really proud of our folks. They\u2019re really doing a great job with their budgets and controlling costs. And I\u2019ll add by just saying, we\u2019re all definitely looking forward to the safe return of the MAX, resuming our growth, utilizing our unabsorbed overhead and beginning to reverse the temporary unit cost penalties that we\u2019re incurring. So thank you again for your question.","Andrew Didora","Great, thank you for that detail Tammy. And then maybe my second question just for Gary or for Mike. Look, I know it\u2019s difficult to comment on full year capacity, given a lot of the moving pieces. But based on what Mike explained in his prepared remarks, what could growth look like once the MAX returns to service? Could it be that high single-digit growth rate that, I think, many were maybe expecting few months back? And then how does sim training change the time line for a full kind of return to optimal utilization for your fleet? Thanks.","Gary Kelly","Tammy, you\u2019re probably in the best position to answer that. We \u2013 Andrew, as you know, we didn\u2019t \u2013 we purposefully did not put any guidance for the year, for the obvious reasons, but Tammy\u2026","Tammy Romo","That\u2019s right. Yes, it is tough to answer for all the reasons we\u2019ve all laid out. In terms of the second quarter, we\u2019ve given you our guidance there for ASM growth, if you strip out the \u2013 if you assume the MAX gets pushed beyond the second quarter, I just offered that probably gets you to roughly flat capacity year-over-year for the second quarter. And then really, it\u2019s just a function of the return-to-service plan. And we\u2019ve told you, we\u2019ve got a good line of sight on the 61 airplanes.","Mike has walked you through the ramping of all of that, which is a several month process. And from there, it\u2019s really, I think, based on the production rates from Boeing, which we just don\u2019t know the answer to that question yet. So it\u2019s just premature to try to get what the capacity ramp-up year-over-year could be here in the second half of the year.","Gary Kelly","And I think Mike pointed this out, but \u2013 so Mike, you might want to comment. But we \u2013 just to be clear, we\u2019re staffed. We\u2019re resourced. We got gates, et cetera, for 61 more airplanes. And so what we have a line of sight on is you got 34 we own, 27 that Boeing has. The issue is there are 16 retirements that are coming. So get to fill up 61 airplanes worth of flying, we\u2019d have to get 16 more beyond the 61 airplanes from Boeing. And whether we\u2019ll get those in 2020, Mike, I don\u2019t think we know. So I think that\u2019s possible.","So the point that I wanted to make with that is we want to get 61 airplanes into service as fast as we can. And that is all understanding that it needs to be safe, it needs to meet all of our other objectives, et cetera. But we\u2019ll want to get to that 61 just as fast as we can. We just don\u2019t know what that speed will be. And some of it may be us. We may find that we want to gate the flow of airplanes back into the operation more than what we know right now. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight. But you can throw any percent out there you want. It\u2019s certainly not going to be 10%. There\u2019s no way. Nothing close to that. And in 2021, I got the same kinds of concerns. So we\u2019re not so worried about the percents right now through as much as you are, but we\u2019re certainly not going to be growing rapidly here in 2020.","Andrew Didora","Understood. Thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Savi Syth","Hey, good afternoon. Just a follow-up, Mike, to clarify, the color that you gave about the MAX. And I know there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty there on the return to service, but color was helpful, but make sure I understand. It sounds like including the manual updates and kind of the concurrent training and maintenance, assuming it\u2019s only a two hours, there\u2019s a lot of assumptions there. It\u2019s about four weeks from certification to \u2013 or at least four weeks from certification to when you can get the aircraft \u2013 sorry, four weeks more than the kind of two months that you have mentioned before to get the aircraft up and running. Is that right? And then also, just would you be willing to kind of train a subset of pilots if it means that you can get the MAX off the ground sooner?","Mike Van de Ven","Yes. So just maybe to give you a little bit more color on that. When there were \u2013 what we were thinking about when there was \u2013 when it was just a requirement of CBT training. There\u2019s a period of time \u2013 there are really three things. There is getting the manuals approved. And so once there is a return-to-service date, we need to get the manuals. We need to get all those changes in our manuals and we have the \u2013 our CMO sign off on all that. And that could take three weeks, let\u2019s say, three to four weeks to get that done.","Once that\u2019s done, we can begin executing on the plan. And the plan is twofold: to get the airplanes into their proper maintenance state, get the pilots trained. When there was just CBT training, we could get pilots trained within 30 days. Now that there is a potential for simulator training, I think that could add at least a couple of months to that date. So that is the best challenge with the CBT training. And that lays over really with the aircraft time at the same time. So that \u2013 hope that gives you a little bit of color from where we were to kind of where we are today.","To be able to subset a group of pilots to bring the airplanes back earlier, we would need systems, we would need procedures, and then we would need an adjustment to our pilot contract to allow how all that works. So there\u2019s a lot of work with that. We\u2019re exploring opportunities in that area. But there is just a lot of risk and uncertainty with all of that. So that\u2019s not an easy path here.","Gary Kelly","Sorry, but in the end, you match all that together and really, compared to what we were assuming before compared to simulator training and again \u2013 another shout out to CAE, who has been terrific to work with \u2013 we\u2019ll have a significant amount of simulator capacity if that\u2019s the route that we need to go and it will add a couple of months.","Mike Van de Ven","Yes.","Gary Kelly","It did work for you. So based \u2013 and you said it, there are a lot of assumptions there, but just trying to give you some guidance. So we won\u2019t be up and running immediately after an ungrounding, it will be several months later.","Mike Van de Ven","The other \u2013 and then lastly, I just want to make clear also is we will have the year before that \u2013 we\u2019re talking about revenue service there, which I know that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in. But before that, we\u2019re going to try \u2013 we will do validation flights out there so that we can make sure that everything that has occurred on those airplanes, they\u2019re flying, they\u2019re maintained, we\u2019ve got all the cobwebs knocked out of them for such \u2013 for a long-term storage. So we will also be \u2013 so the airplanes will be up in the air flying before them.","Gary Kelly","So we can do that. In other words, without having trained our entire core of pilots.","Savi Syth","Makes sense. No, that\u2019s helpful. And I think I missed the four months, though. It sounds like, roughly speaking, from time of recertifications. And then maybe Tammy, just a clarification on the kind of Boeing \u2013 the kind of lower cost that you\u2019re going to get from these compensation. Is some of that already flowing through for the aircraft that you own and are grounded today? So some of it is already reflected and that will continue to build as you go out? And then also just wondering if you can provide the breakout of the fair value for the fuel hedges between \u2013 for 2021?","Tammy Romo","Sure, Savi. The \u2013 just to answer your question first on the compensation. So it\u2019s really pretty straightforward. The compensation will be allocated to the 34 aircraft that we have grounded, so we\u2019ll get some benefit of that here more immediately. And it\u2019s more for next year \u2013 or actually for this year now in the millions, call it, maybe $5 million for this year. And then\u2026","Gary Kelly","Lower depreciation expense.","Tammy Romo","Lower depreciation expense. And then as we bring on the aircraft deliveries in the future, that will simply be spread over the useful life of the aircraft. So the benefit will be realized for, obviously, over many years here. So \u2013 but that\u2019s kind of short and simple explanation of how that\u2019s going to roll out.","Gary Kelly","And so we don\u2019t have \u2013 for the 2020 settlement that we keep talking about, there\u2019s nothing factored into any of our\u2026","Tammy Romo","That\u2019s right.","Gary Kelly","\u2026forward comments for that. So the only thing that\u2019s in 2020 is related to the deal that was done for 2019.","Tammy Romo","That\u2019s correct. So thanks, Gary. And then on your second question, I guess, we laid out in terms of the fair value, the \u2013 it was $2 million for the first quarter and $31 million for the remainder. So just the way that rolls out is, in 2021, we\u2019ll call it roughly another $40 million. In 2022, it\u2019s in the same neighborhood of $40 million. And then in 2023, it\u2019s less than $10 million.","Savi Syth","Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hey everybody, thank you for the time. Hey Gary, you are a \"never say never\" guy, so you might not like this question, but I would challenge you. What are some things \u2013 one or two things that you think you\u2019re fairly sure Southwest will never do as long as you\u2019re CEO? And I asked this question because I\u2019m pretty curious to some like we\u2019re never going to have basic economy a month or two ago. So just \u2013 I\u2019d like to know what is in that never category as long as you\u2019re CEO?","Gary Kelly","I love all your questions always.","Hunter Keay","Thank you.","Gary Kelly","Yes, I don\u2019t know if I can give you a comprehensive list to the nevers. And you are right, I am a \"never say never.\" But I don\u2019t see us ever charging for bag fees. And obviously, one of these days, somebody else could view that differently. We\u2019re not going to do basic economy. We\u2019ve \u2013 there\u2019s been a couple of media stories that were way off, so we\u2019ve tried to clean some of that up. But yes, we won\u2019t be doing basic economy. And I don\u2019t know, Tammy, I\u2019m sure there are some other things that we won\u2019t do. I don\u2019t see us certainly in the near future doing \u2013 well, I don\u2019t know. I was going to say something I probably shouldn\u2019t say. So I won\u2019t say it.","Hunter Keay","My follow-up question then, Gary, is yes, sorry. My follow-up is please tell me what you\u2019re going to say just now.","Gary Kelly","Why is it you\u2019re always asking questions. And that one, I won\u2019t answer.","Hunter Keay","All right, thanks. And then just real quick, I mean, obviously, you said second fleet type decision is not for now. That\u2019s a later discussion. I get it. But can you just run me about just the CBA restrictions around adding a second fleet type? Is that a gating item for a decision to be made across multiple CBAs? Or is that something that can happen concurrently? And just sort of pragmatically order of operations with regard to your CBAs. Thanks a lot.","Gary Kelly","Well, yes, we would need to collaborate with our employees and especially our pilots. I think all of it is contemplated with what Mike and I have been thinking about. Whether it\u2019s a gating factor, it needs to be collaborative. So yes, I don\u2019t know if gating is exactly the right word, but we would need to be thinking about it comprehensively. I think our pilots would be interested in supporting the company in terms of growth in the most economical manner because \u2013 so obviously, it means more jobs for them. It means more upgrades for captain.","So as long as we can conclude that and then convince them that is the right case, I think we can come to an agreement on that. But Tammy and I were talking earlier this morning about this. And for us to have to arrive at a different course of action here with the fleet, we\u2019ve got to have the right timing to meet our needs in terms of additional airplanes. We\u2019ve got to have the right product, and it\u2019s got to come at the right price.","So those are all three, maybe two of the three, at least, are pretty big hurdles to overcome. I think if we were to reverse this and we hadn\u2019t shared with you all that we\u2019re going to explore the risk\/reward of having a single fleet type\/single supplier, I think you\u2019d be asking us. This sort of illustrates the risk of having all of your eggs in one basket. So I think we have a duty to look at that. We\u2019re going to look at it very seriously. And I think we have to be realistic that this can be a hard hurdle to overcome.","So I don\u2019t know, at least, Hunter, in the way I\u2019m thinking about it, I don\u2019t see the threshold question being the CBA. I think the threshold question is does this make sense for us or not. And if it does, well, then you sort of knocked down the other barriers that are out there. But our pilots are great. They\u2019re fantastic, and I certainly don\u2019t see that as a \"hurdle\" or obstacle.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you, Gary.","Gary Kelly","Yes, sir.","Operator","The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","So you\u2019re seeing there\u2019s a chance for hot meals?","Gary Kelly","How did you know?","Jamie Baker","That\u2019s what I heard. Yes, sorry. I respect the confidentiality around the Boeing settlement. So let\u2019s focus on 2020, which has not been settled. How do you calculate or try to calculate the impact? Do you merely look at a pre-shutdown business plan and compare it to actual results? Do you focus on some trailing pretax margin calculus? Do you make adjustments for the fact that your growth-abled competitors now we\u2019ll have over a year\u2019s jump in certain markets, and it\u2019s going to cause something to win that share back? I\u2019m not asking about what you and Boeing might settle on. I\u2019m just wondering how you think about what your entitlement is.","Gary Kelly","Well, I think it\u2019s a very fair question. I don\u2019t know that \u2013 you know and we know that this is a negotiation. This is not contractual. This is a negotiation. So I don\u2019t see being selfish about this. I don\u2019t see a lot of merit or wisdom and is laying out our entire strategy about this. I also don\u2019t want to give our competitors a road map. What I don\u2019t \u2013 if you just simply talk about the harm that the company has incurred. I wouldn\u2019t quarrel with anything that you put out there, and as I mentioned in my remarks, there\u2019s a lot of years, Jamie, where we\u2019ve had a dozen issues that we needed to deal with.","And right now, we\u2019ve been blessed with having one. The operation is fantastic, and I won\u2019t tick through everything that the four of us have been trying to drive home today. But the company is in a really, really good shape. We have one problem, and it\u2019s a serious one. And the sitting here dog paddling for a year while our competitors grow right past us is costing us this year 6 million, 7 million customers.","And yes, I\u2019m very worried about that. And that\u2019s not anything that we can mitigate. We can deal with the operation. We can deal with all these other things, we get the finances whole, so to speak. But that, we can\u2019t do anything about until we get airplanes, until we can grow again. And it\u2019s \u2013 so \u2013 and I do I think we\u2019ve been harmed? Absolutely. And everybody knows we\u2019re going to seek compensation from Boeing. And I\u2019ll just \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll just put a period on it.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Sure, sure. That helps. I appreciate it. When I think about MAX-impacted airlines around the globe, you\u2019re clearly one of the most profitable, if not the most profitable. So put differently, other customers are desperate to get MAXs. There\u2019s no doubt that you want them. But as you point out, it\u2019s not like your margins have collapsed. So as Boeing jiggers around the skyline, would Southwest have any interest in letting some of your delivery slots go to the needy, for lack of a better term? Or is it mandatory that you get what you\u2019re entitled to as fast as humanly possible?","Gary Kelly","It\u2019s somewhat philosophical, I assume, but I think this is a really good company. And I think part of the reason that we\u2019re able to absorb the blow is because of five decades worth of preparation. And we went through 9\/11, and I can vividly remember our competitors whining about their state, and that was their fault they weren\u2019t prepared for the unexpected, without trying to be too harsh here. But we shouldn\u2019t be penalized because we have run a great company for five decades taking care of all of our constituents, especially our shareholders. We shouldn\u2019t be penalized further for that. I wouldn\u2019t be serving all of our stakeholders today if we simply said, \" Oh, well, because we\u2019re not on the verge of collapse, we should forfeit these positions.\" That makes no sense to me. So no, I wouldn\u2019t do that at all. I would say quite the contrary. I think that Boeing has benefited and the 737 program has benefited mightily because of Southwest Airlines and our success over five decades.","Jamie Baker","Very clear. Thank you, Gary.","Gary Kelly","Yes, sir.","Operator","And the next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you. Understand estimates are exactly that, and I think we understand how you get your arms around the cost impact from the MAX being out. But just for argument\u2019s sake, how do you estimate the RASM benefit? As I think about some of the hard choices you\u2019ve had to make, cutting your worst flying, focusing on your best and combined with basically no capacity growth, it feels like the RASM benefit could be very, very substantial. So for example, in the fourth quarter in the press release, I think you called out 2 to 3-point tailwind from the MAX being grounded. What does that compare to? Like what would capacity growth have been? And how do you get to that number?","Gary Kelly","Well, it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re right, there are estimates. And I think, by definition, it\u2019s sort of a with and without, and you don\u2019t know what it \u2013 and we admit, we don\u2019t know exactly what life would have been like with 75 more airplanes as of the end of the year. But I think our folks through \u2013 Tom, through the year has been consistent in pointing out that, yes, we\u2019re not growing capacity and arguably, there\u2019s some benefit from that, at least temporarily. But the way we\u2019ve had to reproduce schedules has been grossly inefficient and put our revenue management in a really tough position. Because we\u2019re not building up bookings in a normal way, and we\u2019re re-accommodating people at low prices, the fourth quarter, of course, was unique with the \u2013 gosh, over 3% was added back for lack of precision in the scheduling, so it was wholly inefficient in the fourth quarter.","So anyway, I think that we\u2019ve laid all of that out, and it\u2019s, at most, in the quarters \u2013 in quarters two, quarters three and quarters one of 2020, it might be 2 points. In quarter four, I think, it\u2019s 0 because it was wholly offset by having a very inefficient schedule. So I think that answers your question. Tammy, I don\u2019t know if you or Tom any differently than I did.","Tom Nealon","No, I just agree to the things you said. I do think this, I think if you just start with the fundamentals, the trends that we saw in Q4 just flowing into Q1. And even if you take them \u2013 I\u2019m not giving guidance on Q2, by the way, but if you begin to look at the early piece of Q2, the trends just continue to look pretty solid. So the fundamentals are good. I think go back to the MAX out of our 2019 performance, we still have performed really, really well. Not mistaken, there\u2019s about 1 point to MAX RASM benefit. So you back that out, we\u2019re still in the 3% range.","I think if you look at 2020, I think it will be a little more modest than that, but we still have strong positive growth. I think what\u2019s interesting is what we can\u2019t lose sight of. I\u2019ll tell you what the problem I\u2019d love to have is a huge capacity plan coming against we have a RASM to deal with, right. So we need to grow, right. But don\u2019t misunderstand, we are still flying a very, very strong schedule.","In fact, just the 2020 base schedule \u2013 April base schedule has more than 4,000 daily flights, 4,016 to be precise. And that\u2019s in comparison to last year\u2019s 4,078. So we still have \u2013 and these are little factoids that I want you guys know because we still have a very, very strong schedule. And what\u2019s also interesting is \u2013 and Mike and I and the operations and commercial teams are very, very tightly linked on this whole RTS thing. I mean, literally daily, right, going through this stuff.","And what I do know is, as Mike and the operations team sort through the reality and the information becomes clearer and clearer, it\u2019s really up to them to tell us when the capacity is available. And the reason I\u2019d say that is, it\u2019s not unusual at all for us in normal circumstances as we move between schedules from high utilization or low utilization or vice versa. It\u2019s not unusual at all for us to flex up 40, 50 aircraft at a time, all right?","So our work in terms of building the MAX back in from a commercial standpoint, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but we know where we put it back in. So it\u2019s going to be governed by how fast are the aircraft coming back into service. And then we\u2019ll just balance the three things we keep talking about: operational stability, financial results and customer. But I think the base trends are solid. We know how to put the capacity back in. In fact, you can see where we put it back in since you can see where we took it out. So I think we\u2019re ready to go once Mike says, okay, here\u2019s the aircraft.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks for that. And then thinking ahead optimistically to that maybe someday where you\u2019re spooling back up for growth what\u2019s spending, if any \u2013 and I\u2019m talking OpEx here, not CapEx, have you deferred as you wait around the basket for Boeing to get its act together? Thanks for taking the questions.","Gary Kelly","On the \u2013 and I heard you clearly there, just another opportunity for me to reinforce. We have not deferred \u2013 and you all correct me. We haven\u2019t deferred any of our capital projects. So we\u2019ve got a lot of investment underway in airports around the country. We just opened up a maintenance hangar in Houston. We\u2019ve got other hangars that we\u2019re working on, a lot of technology efforts. So all of that continues.","On the OpEx side, we\u2019re not burning the fuel. We sort of stopped the hiring at the fleet plan that we\u2019ve shared with you all. So we\u2019re suspending a lot of our hiring other than attrition. And again, none of that is suboptimized. And even with that, again, the results are quite strong. But beyond that, Mike, I can\u2019t think of any \u2013 advertising flops around here. We\u2019re going to obviously support the reintroduction of the MAX at the appropriate time, so you have things like that. But otherwise, I can\u2019t \u2013 unless, you have something specific that you were probing on. I can\u2019t think of anything that you all should expect that will be a large expenditure, except for the marketing and the messaging and those kinds of things. And I\u2019ll leave it up to you how you want to\u2026","Tammy Romo","Yes. And then there\u2019s timing maybe from quarter-to-quarter in terms of maintenance, but all of that, I think, we\u2019ve got a good handle on and can manage. So no, we feel like the costs are in good shape. And other than that, it\u2019s just unique to the return-to-service of the MAX, storage cost, that sort of thing.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. I just have two questions. One is, Gary, have you talked to your pilots or anybody in the team talked to the pilots about the potential of wet leasing aircraft on an absolutely short-term basis to get through this to pick up some of those lost passengers? And my second question is, as you think about shifting from long-haul to short-haul flying, do you worry about what people will say about climate change and whether or not you\u2019re being a good steward of the environment? So thanks very much for the time.","Gary Kelly","Well, Mike, I\u2019ll take them both, and you can chime in here. On the first one, Helane, to be honest with you, with our executive team, we have not spent any time exploring the opportunity for wet leasing. So since we haven\u2019t talked about it, no, we haven\u2019t talked with anybody else in the company. We\u2019re focused on the retirement plan, and then we\u2019re always tuned into the used market. I think that makes the most sense because you just think about the effort involved trying to work with a third party and all the complexities that, that would bring.","It\u2019s not going to be in our configuration. We\u2019ve got a unique business model, et cetera, et cetera. It\u2019s \u2013 everything is sort of predicated on agreeing with our assumption that this is a short-lived issue and not something that we deal with for years. So as long as it\u2019s months, I think we\u2019re making the right judgment. So that\u2019s an easy answer to your question. You may not agree with it, but it\u2019s \u2013 but I think we can give you an accurate answer.","And then on the short versus the long, we\u2019re a short-haul specialist. And we\u2019ve got more short-haul customers than anybody else in the country and arguably more short-haul flights. So the only point I\u2019m making with that is what we\u2019re tweaking here in 2019, because of this is not fundamentally changing our long\/short mix at all. We\u2019re still very, very heavily weighted with the short-haul flights.","With respect to our concern about that, yes, I think we\u2019re concerned about sustainability. And I was asked on CNBC about that this morning, and we are very focused on conservation, on fuel economy. The MAX is front and center in terms of addressing that. It\u2019s important to get that airplane back in service, because it consumes 15% less gas. We need the air traffic control system modernized. And I think the most tangible thing our industry needs to accomplish over the next 10 years, is commercially viable alternative fuels at adequate supplies and at reasonable prices. And that would make a very significant impact.","Carbon offsets are all great. But in my own opinion, there\u2019s only so much offsetting the world can do. And eventually, we need to get it consuming less emissions. But if you look at air transportation relative to other alternatives, it compares very, very well. And so certainly, I don\u2019t see any challenge to our short-haul business anytime soon, if ever, especially if we continue to improve our carbon footprint as we have been doing.","Helane Becker","Great. Thank you very much for those answers. I appreciate your time.","Operator","It appears we have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","David Vernon","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the time. Gary, I think if we go back before, I recall was sort of dominated by the MAX, you guys had laid out a vision for implementing some revenue initiatives that you were very excited about. Have you guys had to delay the time line or introduction of any of those initiatives as you\u2019ve been kind of focusing on managing through the fleet deficit? Or is the \u2013 and we should expect those to kind of come on as the MAX returns? Or has there been no change to the time line on the commercial stuff?","Gary Kelly","No, sir. There\u2019s been no change on that. In fact, I don\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t recall a change that we\u2019ve made because of the MAX with any of it. And again, I\u2019m lumping that in as a capital project. Given the fact that there is a financial penalty associated with the MAX, it sort of encourages to maybe accelerate some of these revenue and other cost initiatives.","And Tammy made this point, but one of our cost initiatives is fleet modernization. And what that means, at least for 2019, 2020 is the acceleration of MAXs into our fleet and the acceleration of retiring some of the older technology. And obviously, we\u2019re not in a position to take advantage of that cost optimization opportunity right now. There was a question earlier about cost inflation.","So we\u2019ll have a little penalty because of that here in the next year or so. And then hopefully, we can get back on track on getting more MAXs in as a percentage of the mix. But except for that, I can\u2019t think of anything that has been deferred. Certainly, as a headline, we\u2019ve asked our officers to execute their plans and execute them well and get them deployed and will start driving the value, especially on the revenue side.","David Vernon","Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, Tammy, the supplier proceeds number of 400, is that associated with the MAX payments? Or what exactly is that when you think about the cash flow numbers in the earnings release?","Tammy Romo","The \u2013 all I can really say there is, it\u2019s supplier proceeds. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, the agreement with Boeing is confidential.","David Vernon","Okay. So we will draw our own\u2026","Tammy Romo","And just to be clear, we do consider that effectively an offset of CapEx. And I think we\u2019ve made that clear as well.","Gary Kelly","And it is a reporting requirement that it would be broken out that way. And I think we would admit that with the Boeing agreement, it makes it material enough that now it is a line item without describing what suppliers are in that line item.","David Vernon","And as you think about the cash that might be created from this supplier proceeds category. Would this be cash that you\u2019d be keeping on hand to fund future requirements? Or would this be something that you might accelerate into the buyback?","Tammy Romo","We will be looking at all of that. I\u2019ll just point back to the statements that I made earlier, which is we\u2019ll continue to take a balanced approach to our capital deployment. And I think if you look at what we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ve used all of those. So again, I\u2019ll just repeat, we\u2019re going to continue investing in the business, at least at this point. We have no intention to slow down reinvestments back in the business. And I think our track record speaks to our goal to also take care of our shareholders. So we\u2019ll just continue to take a balanced approach to all of that, as always.","Gary Kelly","And I would just state the obvious, which is it is always better to have more cash.","Tammy Romo","I love cash.","Gary Kelly","Because there\u2019s lots of options.","Tammy Romo","Gary knows, we love cash.","David Vernon","Thanks a lot guys.","Ryan Martinez","Thank you. Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you all for joining us. And as always, feel free to give us a call, if you have any follow-up questions.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.","Linda Rutherford","Chad, thank you. I\u2019d like to welcome the members of the media to our call today. We\u2019ll go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion. So Chad, if you could just give them instructions on how to queue up, we\u2019ll get started.","Operator","Sure. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead.","Kyle Arnold","Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about why you want to get that $124 million profitsharing payment out to employees this year? And whether as you go forward and negotiate with Boeing and move in to 2020, whether you\u2019re going to look any kind of similarly for employees?","Gary Kelly","Well, Kyle, I think it\u2019s really easy. It\u2019s \u2013 we knew, we were going to settle with Boeing. We also were quite sure that the settlement would not flow through earnings in terms of the classic definition of profits for profitsharing and that \u2013 and you just put yourself an employee position here. So if you\u2019re here as an employee in 2019 and you may not be here for the next 30 to 40 years when this benefit is realized, then you\u2019re harmed.","You\u2019ll never see the benefit of that, and we actually got a settlement from Boeing. So it was \u2013 all of that was anticipated. We shared that early on that we were going to work to sell with Boeing, and we have a precedent over decades of making amendments to the contribution to do what\u2019s right for our people, and that\u2019s either plus or minus, for that matter.","So going way back to 9\/11 and then the government subsidies that were offered up, we paid profitsharing on that, and it did not strictly meet the definition of profits for profitsharing. So long history of doing things like that. And it was a great year. It would have easily been a record year. It was actually a record year even though we had these penalties. And I\u2019m just delighted that we can do that. So \u2013 and so was our board, they were delighted to do it for our people.","Kyle Arnold","And are you going to look for more compensation back to employees as you continue negotiating with Boeing?","Gary Kelly","This is simply a question of how to treat the settlement for profitsharing purposes, period. And we will certainly do in 2020, attempt to do in 2020, while we were able to accomplish with Boeing in 2019.","Kyle Arnold","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question will be from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Alison Sider","Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering, you mentioned that there have been a couple \u2013 just in the last couple of weeks, a few things that are Boeing that been surprising or unexpected big changes to sort of the assumptions that you\u2019ve had. And I was wondering if you could say whether \u2013 how you think, things have changed under their new leadership, what\u2019s improved and what hasn\u2019t, what you\u2019re still looking for?","Gary Kelly","I think it\u2019s way too early. Boeing has been unstable since March of last year, and this is part of the instability. You\u2019ve got a new CEO. You\u2019ve got a new CEO of the commercial organization. So it\u2019s far too early to make an assessment there. Now, both of the \u2013 as you and I have talked, we know all of us know, Stan deal, I think a lot of him. And some of us know Dave Calhoun and think a lot of him. So\u2026","Alison Sider","Great. Now if I could ask one follow-up. Just curious, as you sort of look ahead to return-to-service, curious if you\u2019ve thought at all if there\u2019s any consideration of sort of discounting MAX flights if that\u2019s something we\u2019re likely to see or if that\u2019s not on the table as a possibility?","Gary Kelly","I\u2019ll let Tom speak to that. But I don\u2019t think that we would approach it in the way you described it, but you want to talk about how you\u2019re thinking about reintroducing it to service?","Tom Nealon","Honestly, we\u2019ve done a lot of research on this, right? So Alison, I think that one of the things that is interesting is we are very, very, very focused on the MAX as you are. What\u2019s interesting is the general population is nowhere near zeroed in on this whole topic as we are in the industry. So we are doing a lot of work. We understand the customer perceptions there. So our customers that we talk to and non-customers, they are \u2013 it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s really kind of a bell curve. I think I shared this with you at one point. It\u2019s kind of a bell curve, and the vast majority of that bell curve is we intend to fly the same as we\u2019ve always flown. And then you have the ends of the bell curve.","And actually, the two ends, one end skews higher, and that\u2019s we intend to fly more of the 737 MAX, the proof or the thought being it\u2019s actually be the safest airplane out there, while it\u2019s scrutiny and then some portion to say we\u2019re going to fly less. But I think we\u2019re going to see the customers come back pretty nicely. Some may take a little longer than others, and maybe a month or two months, but they\u2019re going to come back. And at this point, there\u2019s no notion of discounting MAX flights. That\u2019s not in our consideration set at this point.","Alison Sider","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Evan Hoopfer with Dallas Business Journal. Please go ahead.","Evan Hoopfer","Good afternoon, everybody. I just had a quick question for you regarding the potential renaming of the 737 MAX. Gary, I think you said last year that, that is something that you would not be interested in.","I\u2019m just wondering, consumer sentiment ever got so negative where the brand became just so toxic that you would consider that? Or is that kind of a more line in the sand that you will not cross?","Gary Kelly","Well, to me, it\u2019s just a matter of being transparent. Notwithstanding, Tom\u2019s earlier comment, I think the awareness of the MAX issue is very, very high, the importance they attribute to it, I think, is where Tom has hit it. But everybody knows the name, the 737 MAX, and so who\u2019s kidding who? To me, it\u2019s just disingenuous. Now if it\u2019s a different airplane, and it\u2019s a totally different product and it would be appropriate to rename it. But this is a \u2013 ironically, it\u2019s a very minor change to a piece of software when you get right down to it, and it\u2019s Boeing\u2019s call. It\u2019s not ours. And that\u2019s what they call it. But we\u2019ve talked to them, at least the previous management team, and they weren\u2019t interested in doing that. And we certainly haven\u2019t been lobbying them to do it because I think it\u2019s just disingenuous.","Evan Hoopfer","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Pilar Wolfsteller with Flight Global. Please go ahead.","Pilar Wolfsteller","Hi. I\u2019ve got two questions about your Hawaii service. Number one, could you sort of talk a little bit about how successful it\u2019s been or some of your plans for the future? And the second question is do you have any comment to the reports that the FAA gave Southwest preferential treatment when it approved those routes.","Gary Kelly","Well, Tom, I\u2019ll let you talk about Hawaii. I\u2019ll \u2013 since I\u2019m talking, I\u2019ll answer the second one first. Yes, we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about. This is a whistleblower complaint. And we don\u2019t know who the whistleblower is. We don\u2019t know what the complaint is. So I think what I\u2019m mostly focused on \u2013 it sure didn\u2019t feel like we got preferential treatment, by the way, because we worked really hard, and they worked this really hard. But I was proud of the work that our team did. We were told going in that this is probably a 12 to 18-month effort.","I think in the end, we kind of came in around 14 months, which is about what one would expect. It was \u2013 the government shutdown was in the middle of that, which hampered some of the efforts. What I\u2019m most interested in is what issues are there with our ETOPS, I\u2019m not aware of any. Our folks, I think, have done a phenomenal job developing it and then operating it on that point. So I think it\u2019s a long way of saying we don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about.","And then, Tom, I\u2019ll let you talk about Hawaii, please?","Tom Nealon","Well, I think, Hawaii, first of all, it\u2019s \u2013 keep in mind, we\u2019ve been doing this for 10 months. We\u2019ve been flying Hawaii over 10 months. It is doing phenomenal, right? So everything that we expected is at or better than our expectations. Keep in mind, it\u2019s a small piece of our business. It\u2019s right around 2%, but it has a very important role that it really supports our California business, so it\u2019s succeeding on every dimension. I think the demand and the load factors have been very, very good. We\u2019re very satisfied with that, both the long haul as well as the interisland.","Our ramp up, honestly, has been a little slower than we originally expected because of the MAX and the capacity issue, but everything we put into service, we\u2019re thrilled with at this point. We are \u2013 I think this is a right of and check it, but we\u2019ve got to see, 14 daily flights in California to Hawaii across four of our big cities: Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento and San Diego. We have 38 dailies interisland. So it\u2019s doing fantastic. We\u2019re really happy with it. What\u2019s interesting is we\u2019re actually creating demand that we didn\u2019t even see as being there.","So we\u2019re seeing more connecting itineraries within the West Coast, which is interesting because we\u2019re creating demand, we\u2019re growing the market and fares are lower. And what does that sound like to you? That is the classic Southwest effect. So it\u2019s happening again. And I guess, the last point and I\u2019ll be quiet here is just \u2013 I think one of the questions we were asked a lot is, this is a pretty long-haul flight. How do you feel like your product is going to perform on the long-haul flight?","And by the way, it\u2019s not our longest long-haul flight. We have transcon that are longer. But having said that, the scores for the customer experience and the brand scores are actually higher than our total system, right, from the mainland to Hawaii flight. So net-net, we are very, very comfortable and thrilled where we are.","Gary Kelly","Kind of a long answer to our flight attendants and the ratio as they do.","Tom Nealon","Speaking real quickly to the ETOPS process, we are involved in that, and it was not a quick process, very, very thorough, and it was very, very challenging. And you look at the quality of what we\u2019re doing today, it is phenomenal. So I can\u2019t speak kind of enough of the operations team, what they\u2019ve accomplished in short period of time. Actually, it wasn\u2019t short it\u2019s 14 and 15 months to get done, by the way, which is 12 to 18 is the norm. So that is not a fast path.","Gary Kelly","But Mike, at this point, no one from the FAA has come to you on any issues with ETOPS, I think?","Mike Van de Ven","No, no. Like Gary said, it was a whistleblower complaint, I don\u2019t really know a lot about it. Just getting an ETOPS authorization, that is automatic. And there\u2019s a rigorous approach to that. There are advisory circulars at the FAA layoff. You take that and you follow it. We did that. And over a 14-month period, have pretty good procedures in place. After you start flying, you\u2019re in a heightened surveillance period for six months. We\u2019ve had over 3,000 flights since we started service there. And the indications are the procedures that we were authorized to perform were performing, we\u2019re executing very well. And they\u2019re doing exactly what the FAA and Southwest Airlines expected them to do.","Gary Kelly","So it\u2019s all a surprise to us. And again, if there are issues, we want to know what they are, and we would be happy to address them. But right now, we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about.","Pilar Wolfsteller","Thanks.","Operator","It appears that we have time for one last question today, and that question comes from David Slotnick with Business Insider. Please go ahead.","David Slotnick","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the call. I was just wondering, because you were talking about the \u2013 I think you said nine full flight simulators by the end of 2020. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your future hiring plans once the MAX is ungrounded, really over the next 10 years. I know that the simulators represent a big investment. So sort of wondering how that fits into the whole thing?","Gary Kelly","You want to talk about that, Mike?","Mike Van de Ven","Yes. Yes, David. So we have \u2013 as we bring airplanes into the fleet, we hire a certain number of pilots and flight attendants for the airplanes that we bring into the fleet. And so that\u2019s there\u2019s just the math that we go through and we do that. The other thing that influences our pilot hiring are retirements. And so we\u2019ve got probably around 300 to 400, and it grows every year as we age the 300 to 400 pilots that go through retirement. And then so we are adding our pilot hiring with \u2013 to replace retirements and the airplane to come out of the fleet.","But as Gary mentioned, we\u2019ve got \u2013 if we don\u2019t have production airplanes from Boeing this year, we\u2019ll only have 45 net new airplanes this year, and we\u2019re already staffed up to 61. So we don\u2019t need a lot of additional hiring in 2019. And let\u2019s just start ramping up beginning in 2020 as the delivery process from Boeing resumes.","Gary Kelly","But we do plan to grow. We plan to grow and we\u2019re up to 15 to 20 airplanes a year. And we plan to hire thousands of people every year. So even in recessionary times in our history, we\u2019ve been able to grow and not shrink. Obviously, we \u2013 some years, we might grow less. But for the most part, 2009 may be an exception to that. But yes, we definitely plan to grow and continue to hire.","David Slotnick","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.","Linda Rutherford","Thank you, Chad.

My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Martinez","Thank you, Tom. And welcome, everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today we have Gary Kelly, Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO and other members of senior management.","Please note today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements. And because these statements are based on the Company\u2019s current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of the future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, which excludes special items, please reference this morning\u2019s press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations to non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","Gary will begin with an overview of our performance, followed by Tammy with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and our current outlook. Following Tammy\u2019s remarks, we will be available to answer questions.","And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Kelly","Thank you, Ryan. And thanks everybody for joining our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. It was an excellent quarter all the way around, and I want to thank all of our 56,000 plus employees for an exceptional year and congratulate them on another very strong profit sharing for 2017 of $543 million and then as an addition to the $70 million tax reform bonus that we shared. After two years of modest unit revenue declines, we turned the corner in 2017, and that\u2019s despite a very competitive industry environment. Unit revenues were up in the quarter 1.9% and just under 1% for the full year.","We\u2019re currently estimating 1% to 2% unit revenue growth on strong load factors and bookings for first quarter 2018, and our goal is for positive unit revenue comparisons again for this year. Better revenue management tools and techniques, enabled by our new reservation system, will help mitigate any competitive pressures for this year. I expect those benefits from the new system to begin in second quarter.","Fuel prices are up over the last quarter and the futures prices become reality, we\u2019ll see some cost pressure there. But the federal tax rate reduction more than offsets that pressure. And excluding fuel profit sharing and special items, our unit cost outlook for the year is excellent with a goal of moving unit cost down slightly.","Depending on fuel prices, our goal is to realize operating margin expansion for 2018. Given the tax reform, in addition to that, we would realize even greater net margin expansion. And both of those will drive stronger future cash flows. But it is worth of repeating that in addition to the margin expansion, we\u2019ve reduced our federal income tax liability at the end of 2017 by $1.4 billion, and that cash flow benefit will go through in the future years in addition to the cash flow benefit from future margin expansion.","Our growth plans for 2018 are unchanged. We end the year with 750 aircraft, which recovers the classic fleet retirement in the end of -- or the third quarter last year, grows our fleet by 27 airplanes effectively over a 24 month period. So I\u2019m simply measuring year-end 2016 to the year-end 2018.","Now, work is well underway to begin flying to Hawaii, so that is a focus for this year. And we announced this morning our intention to add Paine Field in Everett, Washington later this year and it will complement our presence of TTAC. Aside from the modest growth plans, our focus for 2018 will be on the basics. Unlike the past seven years, we have no major strategic initiatives that are landing in 2018, and that allows a more intense focus on running a greater line, offering outstanding customer service and controlling our cost. Capital spending will also be down this year. 2017 closed out on a very positive note. 2018 looks even better for all the reasons I just outlined.","And with that very quick overview, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Tammy Romo, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through the quarter.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Gary and thank you all for joining us today. I want to first thank our employees for their hard work and congratulate them on another successful year, earning $543 million in profit sharing. 2017 was a year of many accomplishments and it ended with a strong fourth quarter performance. Fourth quarter net income was easily a record with profits of $1.9 billion or $3.19 per share. And as we announced in our 8-K filing earlier this month, we recorded a very large tax adjustment as a result of tax reform.","In reevaluating our deferred tax liabilities and assets to reflect a lower future tax rate, we reported a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter, which we called out as a special item. Excluding the tax reform adjustment and normal hedge accounting special items, fourth quarter net income was a strong $459 million or $0.77 per diluted share, up hitting ahead our first call consensus. We were proud to celebrate the passage of tax reform with our employees and a $1,000 bonus to each of them earlier this month. The employee bonus of $70 million was included in our non-GAAP results and impacted our earnings per share by $0.07.","With these strong returns and another year of strong operating cash flow in 2017, we were able to make prudent investments in our business, take care of our people and return significant value to our shareholders. We\u2019re off to a great start this year. And in addition to covering more detail on our fourth quarter results, I will also provide an outlook for 2018.","Starting with revenue, we ended 2017 with record fourth quarter operating revenue of $5.3 billion, driven largely by record passenger revenue of $4.7 billion. Strong demand for low fares resulted in a fourth quarter record load factor of 85%. Passenger revenues yields were slightly year-over-year but improved sequentially from third quarter as expected. And demand was strong during Thanksgiving and December holiday period.","Flight revenue also performed well during the peak season, resulting in a 7.1% increase year-over-year. Our Rapid Rewards and EarlyBird revenues also were strong. In fact, our EarlyBird revenue for fourth quarter 2017 alone was approximately $100 million, which was our initial target for EarlyBird when we first called out the boarding option. Overall, we were pleased with our record fourth quarter operating revenue performance and outpaced our capacity growth to produce a RASM increase of 1.9% year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. We were also pleased to achieve a goal of unit revenue growth for full year 2017, albeit modest considering the unprecedented national disasters in competitive industry environment during 2017.","Looking ahead to first quarter 2018, passenger revenues appear stable and travel demand and bookings are solid. And as we expect, favorable year-over-year trends in first quarter 2018 freight and other revenue. Based on these trends and our current outlook, we expect first quarter 2018 RASM to increase in the 1% to 2% year-over-year. Later this quarter, we will issue an investor update. This 8-K will reflect in a typical guidance update, as well as potential changes to our guidance as a result of accounting changes based on the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition. We plan to utilize our investor updates on a quarterly basis as needed. And therefore, we will no longer report RASM guidance at our monthly traffic releases, beginning with the report of January traffic results early next month.","Turning to fuel, our fourth quarter 2017 economic fuel price per gallon was $2.09, fourth quarter's $2.09 per gallon included $0.19 of fuel hedging losses. However, our fuel hedging losses are behind us now and our hedge portfolio for 2018 and beyond provides us a nice protection against cash drop prices and energy prices without the forward exposure. And it enables us to make prudent adjustments to our business in a rising fuel price environment in order to maintain our financial goals and reduce our volatility and our earnings.","For 2018, we plan to early adopt an accounting standards update related to hedging where we will begin reporting fuel hedging premium expense with the fuel and oil expense above the line rather than within other gains and losses below the line on income statement. As such, we are providing our 2018 fuel price per gallon guidance, including fuel hedging premiums as shown in this morning's earnings release and we\u2019ll recast prior periods later in the first quarter as part of our 8-K update.","Moving on now to our outlook, on fuel. Based on market prices and our hedging portfolio as of January 19th, for first quarter 2018, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.10 to the $2.15 range, including approximately $34 million or $0.07 per gallon in fuel hedge premium, and an approximate $0.05 per gallon hedging gain. For full year 2018, we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to also be in the $2.10 to $2.15 range, including approximately $135 million or $0.06 per gallon in fuel hedge premium and $0.04 per gallon hedging gain.","At current market prices, our 2018 fuel hedge positions began to produce modest gains and about $65 per barrel Brent crude with more material hedge gains hitting in at our 75 per barrel range and higher.","Before I move to non-fuel cost, I want to spend a moment on fuel efficiency. As announced, we retired our remaining Classic fleet in third quarter 2017 and introduced a more fuel efficient 737 MAX 8 into our fleet in fourth quarter. As we\u2019ve continued to modernize our fleet, we have seen the nice increase and available seat miles per gallon, improving 1.3% year-over-year in fourth quarter.","For 2018, we currently expect 2 to 3% improvement year-over-year in available seat miles per gallon. Excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, our fourth quarter unit cost increased 4.6% year-over-year. Putting aside the year-end items for just a second, fourth quarter unit cost trends were in line with our original expectations as we saw expected increases in salary, wages and benefits, advertising spend and shifted from third quarter and incremental technology cost that included ramping up for ETOPS in preparation for Hawaii.","As disclosed in our January 2nd 8-K, we have 3.5 points of incremental cost pressure at year-end, primarily driven by the employee bonus. Based on current cost trends, we expect first quarter CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the half of point to 1.5% range year-over-year. The primary drivers of the year-over-year increase include inflationary increases in salary, wages and benefits, which include higher cost related to an extended operating day driven by our cost of retirement and our current fleet deficit.","We also expect increases in airport landing fees and rentals and maintenance. And then looking ahead to the full year 2018, we expect our CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to be in the range of flat to down 1% year-over-year, which is a very solid performance. For 2018, our largest year-over-year cost tailwind is approximately $200 million related to the Classic retirement and benefits, and depreciation, aircraft rentals and maintenance expense. We also have some offsetting headwinds in the areas of maintenance of our aging at our 700 fleet as well as airport costs.","While the benefits of the Classic retirements are easier to see in depreciation and aircraft rentals, we do have a 2018 and cost of year-over-year benefit within maintenance expense. However, this classic maintenance savings is more than offset by the increased maintenance of our aging -700 fleet.","I\u2019ll just make a few comments on the balance sheet and our capital deployment. We ended 2017 with arguably the strongest balance sheet in our history, and we\u2019re very proud of that. Our solid investment grade rating is intact and we are pleased with the upgrades for both Moody\u2019s and S&P during the 2017, as well as the recent positive outlook revision by Fitch.","Our liquidity is strong with cash and short term investments of approximately $3.3 billion at year end. And during the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million in unsecured debt and among the tighter spreads and lowest yields in Southwest\u2019s history. With this additional capital primarily to refinance existing debt, we continue to target leverage in the low to mid-30% range.","Free cash flow for 2017 was the strong $1.8 billion, driven by $3.9 billion in operating cash flow and capital expenditures of $2.1 billion. Our strong cash flow and financial position allow us to return $1.9 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend. Our 2017 CapEx of $2.1 billion came in below guidance, primarily due to the shift of approximately $115 million out in 2017 and into 2018 related to one MAX 8 delivery and several non-aircraft investments that were just the shift in the spend.","We are still expecting our 2018 CapEx to decrease versus 2017, and are currently estimating 2018 CapEx to be approximately $1.9 billion. Included in this total, we expect 2018 aircraft CapEx of approximately $1 billion and non-aircraft CapEx in the $900 million range, including the shifting I previously mentioned from 2017. We continue to effectively balance and manage our overall capital deployment and we remain focused on preserving our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows, while returning significant value to our shareholders. And with the expected future tax savings from tax reform, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate our investments in our company, our people and our shareholders, including the mix of share repurchase and dividend with an overarching goal to drive long-term value for our shareholders.","Moving onto fleet. Of course, fourth quarter was our first quarter flying are all Boeing, NGs and MAX aircraft on the heels of retiring the remaining Classic fleet, and actually fourth quarter was the first. And we ended 2017 with 706 aircrafts with the delivery of 19 aircrafts during fourth quarter. This is one fewer plane that expected with MAX delivery shifting into 2018. We currently have 13 MAX 8 aircrafts in our fleet. And as you saw in our January 2, 8K, we made some minor changes to our Boeing order book. We exercise 40 options for MAX 8 from orders to deliver in 2019 and 2020, deferred 23 and MAX 7 from orders to better align with our future -700 retirement and accelerated 23 MAX 8 from orders to 2021 to 2022 timeframe.","We will have significant 737-700 NG retirements over the next 10 years to 15 years based on their age and this order book refresh, along with our remaining order book and option, which allow us to manage through those retirement in a measure way, while allowing flexibility for growth. Aircraft CapEx remains very manageable at approximately $1 billion per year on average for the next five years.","Our 2018 fleet and capacity plans have not change and we continue to expect to end the year with 750 total aircraft base of our current firm aircraft delivery schedules.","On the capacity front and in line with our previous expectations, we expect 2018 full year capacity to increase in the low 5% range year-over-year. And our third quarter 2017 of approximately 5,005 cancellations due to the national disasters, is driving roughly half of point of our full year 2018 ASM year-over-year growth. We expect or first half 2018 capacity to increase about 3% range year-over-year, as we firmed up our first half 2018 schedule. The next schedule will be published on February 15th, and that will go out through September 28th.","For second half 2018, we expect our capacity to increase in the low 7% with higher year-over-year growth in fourth quarter 2018 due to the impact of last year's Classic retirement. We remain excited about our 2018 growth opportunities and we have a prudent 2018 group growth plan that produces positive year-over-year RASM for us based on our current outlook.","So in closing, we had a really strong 2017 performance and 2018 is shaping up to be another solid year, which will also benefit significantly from tax reform. And as we start the year, we are well positioned for margin expansion, excluding special items. Our employees continue to deliver a reliable operation and product, and they have been proving that they are the best in the industry for the past 45 plus years. I was thrilled that we have recognized their hard work with the recent year-end tax reform bonuses, and I am very proud that they continue to be recognized for their world class hospitality. We have a bright future ahead of Southwest, and I am excited for our shareholders with the sustained momentum we have coming into 2018.","So with that, Tom, I think we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We'll now begin with our first question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Gary, I still consider Southwest to be a point-to-point operator that just happens to have a few very large basis operations, that resemble hubs. And I am thinking this might be an outdated characterization. I am curious to the degree to which you currently schedule and revenue manage for connectivity over places like Baltimore, Nashville, Denver. How that's changed over time, particularly with the new res platform, and how you think it may evolve from here?","Gary Kelly","Jamie, I think your view of Southwest is accurate. Some of the statistics that I remember well from 1980's when I joined is that, and those days and a much lower load factor, about 80% of our O&Ds flew non-stop and then the other 20% were split pretty evenly between through traffic and connections. And in the 80s and the 90s and really probably for early 2000s, we did not intentionally schedule for the convenience of connections. Since 2009, we have had some percentage of our flights that will out -- we use the term internally intentionally connect. What is interesting is -- and when I started, the annual load factor was 58%. If you go back 20 years ago, my memory serves me right it was 66% now it\u2019s 85%, 84%, 85%. So there has been a significant boost, but the non-stop versus connecting traffic hasn\u2019t moved much at all, maybe 3 or 4 percentage points.","So the net result of that is we are carrying more connecting traffic. We\u2019re carrying some of it more on purpose, if you will, as opposed by accident in the old days, but there is still a very -- a real serious focus on point-to-point non-stop that\u2019s the way our network planners -- that's the philosophy and that is the strategy. I did want to use it is an opportunity though to complement them, because the load factors have gone up 20 points to 30 points over 20 year to 30 year time period. And it\u2019s not because they have converted us to a hub and spoke operation where we\u2019re more dominated by connecting traffic. It was a really accomplished by optimizing the flight schedule better and in some cases, spinning out some of the frequencies in our higher frequency markets, but not at the expense of the non-stop traffic.","Andrew Watterson, our EVP over Commercial is here with us and he may remember, I don\u2019t remember off the top of my head exactly the percentage of what we think the relevant statistic would be that we intentionally connect in terms of capacity, but it\u2019s obviously Jamie not the majority of our sales. And Andrew do you recall what that statistic is.","Andrew Watterson","I would call slightly above 20%.","Gary Kelly","And I think that was your specific question. But that hopefully the background helped a little bit as well.","Jamie Baker","Gary, thank you, that\u2019s terrific. And for a follow up, the goal to maintain positive RASM for the year, you\u2019re starting respectably at the 1% to 2% levels presumably the second quarter is no worse, probably better. But given that capacity surge and you\u2019re in the second half your annual aspiration would seem to imply that you remain in positive territory in each of the four quarters. Assuming that that\u2019s directionally accurate, what\u2019s the driving factor that really gives you the confidence in second half positive RASM on at a higher base of year-on-year capacity? Is there anything specific?","Gary Kelly","I do think there are a couple of fundamental specifics. And first of all, your direction I believe is correct. Now, admittedly 1% to 2% outlook for the first quarter doesn\u2019t give us a lot of cushion for things to go sideways. So I\u2019ll admit that from the outset and that I think obviously applies even more quarters two, three, and four, we just don\u2019t have as much visibility there. But when we get to the second half of the year, we should have a much better schedule. What I am real proud of quite frankly in the fourth quarter is that we achieved pretty healthy unit revenue gains with a not so great schedule, because what has happened is we have retired, Mike, 50 airplanes in the third quarter. The fleet shrunk. We tried to maintain a scheduled presence that wasn\u2019t that different.","And you have to take into account seasonality dips that we would have scheduled anyway. But in order to generate roughly the same amount applies with fewer airplanes, we had to extend the day of the airplane. And 2 times of the day that are as profitable, quite frankly. So there is a fairly significant discount to have a flight operating at 9 pm as compared to operating at 6 pm.","So all that means is that we believe we\u2019ll have a security schedule in place that will yield better by the time we hit to the second half of this year. So that\u2019s point number one. And then point number two, notwithstanding the angst that I note yesterday and today about the industry, we\u2019ve got a new revenue stream in effect that\u2019s coming online this year that Tammy and our team is still pretty confident that will hit in the $200 million range. So that should pick up throughout the year.","And I think that those are both pretty significant points, and nobody ever knows what the weather is going to be. We can't really tell you what impact we\u2019re going to have from competition or the economy. One, we would hope the tax reform is at least a floor on travel demand. We\u2019re not doing anything overt to plan for a pickup in travel demand because of that, but obviously we\u2019re hopeful that that will be a lift as well.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Gary, just to start off, I have a couple of tax reform questions. But Tammy referred to this in prepared comments. We would love to get your take on as well. Southwest is really in this unique position among airlines, because you guys are the only airlines that will benefit immediately from the cash tax savings, as well as from new corporate tax rate. So I would love to get your thoughts for a moment. How are you all prioritizing this increased cash flow? We\u2019ve already seen the special bonus to employees. But beyond that, are you all thinking about increased reinvestment in the business, or should we be thinking about a step up in capital returns to shareholders? Because it seems like your free cash flow could really step up quite a bit because of the tax reform here.","Gary Kelly","I'll just offer unsolicited editorial comment it is about time that we level the playing field competitively on this matter, as well as comparing our industry to other sectors. And obviously, Jack, you are well-informed on that. But we\u2019re very happy with that. It helps us lower our cost and we\u2019re not going to squander these savings. It puts us in a much better competitive position.","So the priorities are -- I don\u2019t know if they are equal. But clearly, we all want to use this as an opportunity to keep our overall cost structure below so that we can keep our fares low, drive strong load factors and to continue to support our growth plan. There's enough money available to us where we can think about investments in the business. And Tammy explained well what we did with our Boeing order, but we have two, in terms of putting additional capital to work in the business, we have two basic options. We can buy more airplanes and use them to grow the fleet or we can buy new airplanes and use them to replace older aircraft. And we have opportunities certainly in the latter that we'll be exploring aggressively.","The Boeing order is an example of that. So there may be more opportunities there in the future. I do want to be clear and say that we're not today thinking that we're going to increase our growth rate by buying more aircraft. If that happens, because circumstances support that, I think we'll all be very happy. But that is not what we're thinking today.","In terms of taking care of our -- so I've talked about customers, I've talked about investing in the business, in terms of taking care of our employees. We're 85% unionized. So labor -- I've read some, what I would call, uninformed comments in the media. All compensation has to be negotiated with covered employees. So that is a separate issue. And then finally, in terms of continuing to support our shareholders, it just puts us in a stronger position to continue doing what we've been doing, which is for the past -- I can't remember Brian how many years we've increased the dividend annually and we have obviously sustained a very healthy share repurchase program. And I think it is worth mentioning, last year was a rough year in terms of mother nature and in terms of some of the tragedies around the country and it's a source of an immense pride at Southwest that we're able to support our communities and I was very happy that we were in position where we could actually boost that support also.","Jack Atkins","Asking about tax reform from another angle though. One area that I think folks are under-appreciating is potential for boosting the economy in the relatively near term from tax reform, hitting folks\u2019 pocket books sooner rather than later in addition to increase business confidence. So you said in your comments earlier, you're not prepared you're planning for increased travel demand. But as you think about how this progresses over the next several quarters as we go into the spring summer travel season, and as we get into the peak travel season into the fall. It just seems to me like there's a real opportunity here for a pickup in leisure travel in addition to business travel. And I would just love to get some more thoughts on that specific topic?","Gary Kelly","Well Jack, I agree with you. Again, I just don't want to give people the wrong impression about what we are committed to do today, but I realize there's angst among some about the growth rate of the industry. But I think a lot of people expect that GDP growth will accelerate. I think it'd be very logical to assume from that that you could see a boost in travel demand. Honestly, I think people should calm down and I think this could prove to be much to do about nothing.","Now, we\u2019re growing this year and we\u2019re planning to add new service to Hawaii. We\u2019re going to open up Paine Field in Everett, Washington, and we\u2019re a growth company we know how to do this. So we\u2019ll want to manage our growth very carefully. The success for us is dependent upon keeping our cost low, so we can keep fairs low and we can attract new customers either by simulating or by moving them over to Southwest.","I think what you\u2019re talking about is, I don\u2019t if it\u2019s a safety net, but it ought to provide some support for the current growth plans. And again, I just would reiterate that we haven\u2019t changed our growth plan because of tax reform, but it should put us in a position where that is more of a realistic option in the future. It won\u2019t happen for us in 2018, Andrew. I mean there is -- we have the potential to push our utilization somewhat, but not much and probably not. So I think any future growth thoughts, in my opinion, would be beyond 2018 in any event.","And I\u2019ll just reiterate one more time what Tammy reported. In terms of exercising the Boeing orders has no impact to what our growth plans were or are for those years after 2018 as well. It\u2019s simply firming up options that we had planned to exercise in any event and now we have the bright economics to go ahead and move forward and make that commitment.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Gary, I want to continue this talk of fleet process we\u2019ve talked about a little bit in the call. What were -- would you consider a new fleet type if there was significant cockpit commonality and maybe just overall commonality with the 37, or did your experience with AirTran 717 totally sour you on that concept?","Gary Kelly","Hunter, no, it did not. But I just will repeat what I know you know, but the opportunity for us with 7117 versus 737 trade-off was an opportunity to replace a smaller airplane that was not common with a bigger airplane that it is common at the same cost. So it was a no brainer and that trade alone Tammy, as I recall, was worth couple of hundred million dollars a year. So that\u2019s part of the earnings boost that we\u2019re realizing over the past five years. But we could have done it. Now Mike never got to the point where we integrated that aircraft into Southwest Airlines. So every flight that it took after we acquired AirTran was on the AirTran operating certificate.","So we never realized what\u2019s you\u2019re asking. I think the time horizon is important in answering your question. I would assume that in a generation that we would be open minded to what you\u2019re suggesting in terms of my opening comments about thinking about 2018 and what\u2019s our focus, it\u2019s focused very much on the basics, running a great operation, offering great customer service and managing our cost. It is not anything that we are thinking about for 2018, \u201819, \u201820, \u201921, as far as I can see, there is no work underway here at all to think about a different airplane. I don\u2019t believe we have optimized our fleet mix yet with the mix of 800\/MAX 8 versus 700s. And of course we don\u2019t have a MAX 7 yet. So I do think that there is an opportunity to continue up-gauging here for some time, and that also puts off any serious thought about adding a different fleet type, because we don\u2019t have the, what we consider to be the optimal fleet yet anyway.","Boeing has other variations they\u2019ve got the MAX 9. Right now, we don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that we have any interest in the airplane. There is a MAX 10 coming and then what's casually referred to in the media is the 797 or 757 replacement. Both the MAX 10 and this -- the idea of the 757 replacement or things that we\u2019ll talk to Boeing about just make sure we understand what those airplanes do, what they don\u2019t do, but there is no serious effort to bring them on board. And so finally, it would be a lot of work, I will to admit to you. It would be a lot of work for us to take that on, because we are hardwired to operate the 737. We certainly have better capabilities today than we did when we bought AirTran to take that work on, but it doesn't mean that it would still be free of cost or free of effort. And right now, we have immense opportunities to grow with the 737 MAX 8, MAX 7 that we\u2019re very excited about and that will be our focus, I think for a long time.","Hunter Keay","And then just maybe a quick one. I appreciate the commentary on margin expansion. And just to be clear, that\u2019s even with moving $157 million of option premium expense above the line, you are referring to EBIT margin when you talk about expanding margin this year. Is that correct?","Tammy Romo","Yes, that\u2019s correct, even with that.","Hunter Keay","And by the way, that [$115 million] is that about right, Tammy?","Tammy Romo","It\u2019s actually 135ish for the year. And by the way, since you are asking about that, our goal would be to bring that down in 2019 and we\u2019re budgeting somewhere in the $80 million range for that. So that will be a nice tailwind for us as we move to the 2019.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","I wonder if you could -- I know you haven\u2019t given guidance based on the new accounting standard. But maybe just high-level what you think the impacts would be to revenue growth, unit cost growth and margins in '18?","Tammy Romo","We are still looking at all that. So I really would rather wait and provide all that for you in the 8-K. We\u2019re just in the middle of finalizing all those results. So if you could just be a little more patient for us, we\u2019ll come back with a very robust report later this quarter.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then just how are you thinking about the cash tax rate under the new regime?","Tammy Romo","Our tax rates have been more like the 20% range and we\u2019ll -- I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be any worst than that as we move forward. We're still working through some of the technicalities on the depreciation rule. By the time we get to later this year, we're expecting full 100% expensing in the year that we acquire the aircraft. So we're still working through a little bit of that to finalize it. But obviously, it will have a very meaningful impact on our cash taxes for the year and that we noted in the earnings release, we expect that to be in the hundreds of millions dollars a year and that both on a P&L perspective as well as on a cash basis, so it\u2019s very significant.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Just on the -- just a follow-up Tammy on the fuel hedge comments, and I am glad to hear that the target to bring the premium down. But curious with lot of these -- it doesn't seem like you're getting much of a asset here in 2018, even though fuel is going to run up. So I am guessing kept your traffic levels that you're pinning the hedges that are pretty high. Given that most of your competitors aren\u2019t hedging either, I mean what's maybe a better question. How are you shifting your hedging strategy, because it doesn't seem to be necessarily paying off?","Tammy Romo","We just look at it differently, Savi. The hedging strategy is really insurance potential for us, in the event we see a spike in fuel prices as it'll start kicking and showing some nice gains here, and in fact already seeing that. But it's really designed to provide protection should be seen on anticipated sites and in the fuel prices. So we expect our premium budget every year, and that we've a goal of that, we would have very meaningful protection, should prices rise to more catastrophic levels. But in the meantime, we're actually seeing some nice gains here. And as you'll see another jump up as you get into even the $75 per barrel range. And Savi if you look at our sensitivity analysis that we normally provide, you'll see what I am referring to, but is really designed for us so that should prices rise, we have time to adjust the business to those higher input costs.","So we really think of a bit more as the insurance protections. Now going forward more tactically with the techniques that we're using going forward, we're mindful of the downside exposure in the way we have our hedges layered on. We do not have any downside risk or floor exposure, over -- well for our entire hedge book. So I think we are very well positioned.","Savi Syth","And just follow-up on that, the target is the $80 million, how do you achieve that?","Tammy Romo","Pardon me, Savi.","Savi Syth","How do you achieve the reductions to $80 million?","Tammy Romo","That we've been layering on our hedges and where we are -- by doing that, we\u2019ve had opportunities to build what I would say a very nice hedge positions at very reasonable fuel premium level. So keep in mind we\u2019ve been building up to deep levels and that\u2019s the result of the price be up but the options that we put in place.","Gary Kelly","And Savi, I didn\u2019t look back at the press release, but there is heavier weight in 2018. So 2019 is a really good hedge. It\u2019s got a nice balance between how much money we\u2019ve spent on it, the covers that we get and then the sensitivities that Tammy has provided in there. So it\u2019s really a very clean hedge as is 2020, we\u2019re off to a good start with that one. 2018 has a little swap in it as I recall Tammy because we had to go in and unwind some of the puts that were on. So there was little bit of penalty, if you will, in terms of the way that that year was built. But if part of your question is, do we think $135 million is a right number? No. Tammy and I both agree that that\u2019s more money than we want to spend on the program, especially considering that our margins are handsome and that we have opportunities to grow the margins in addition to that. So there is -- we\u2019re well under absorbed more risk with energy prices going up than we were going back to 2012-2013 when we had much tighter margins and a more ambitious transformation plan that was underway. So we have a different time. We have a different opportunity. And I think our folks have done a great job of taking full advantage of that.","Savi Syth","That\u2019s all very helpful color, thank you. And just a quick one on the unit revenue, you mentioned that the demand -- so the demand was strong on the peak period. Just curious what you\u2019re seeing in the off peak. And just wondering if industry just has a little too much supply in the off peak, and is there anything we can do about that as we continue to layer on supply?","Tammy Romo","Demand for us, Savi, through the first quarter as you can see from our load factor performance was very strong. We are generating record load factor performances. And of course the story there has been at lower yield. So we certainly win, we\u2019re in off peak seasons. I think it\u2019s fair to say we all have to work a little harder for that demand. But as you could see from our fourth quarter performance and based on the outlook that we provided you earlier in the call that we\u2019re seeing very nice demand even in the off peak period.","Gary Kelly","Andrew, you can comment on this, if you would like. But the industry overtime has gotten better and better at varying capacity according to seasonality. And I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that we were the late to that gain, because we were just hard wired to have a constant schedule throughout the year. But now I feel like we have fully caught up there. So you have some -- some of the competitors have a more pronounced peak and valley in terms of the scheduling than others, but the capabilities are there. And I\u2019ll just again speak for Southwest. I think we do a pretty darn good job of matching that. Now we felt like going back to 2017 that we had one schedule that maybe it was a little bit too long and didn\u2019t move into the seasonally softer period fasten now. And it was -- I don\u2019t know that I would call it a mistake per se. But it is a change that we have already planned for 2018, as an example. So it's an iterative process. You learn as you go and school in school out the timing of holiday, all of these things are fairly complex inputs. But I agree with what Tammy said, we\u2019re looking at a record loan factor, potentially here again in the first quarter. So the demand is there and even with seasonality.","Tammy Romo","One more comment just to add on to that, particularly with some of our new international market that does provide us opportunities and maybe do a little more seasonal flying than what we\u2019ve done this 4Q. So our commercial folks do a fantastic job managing through those peak demand periods.","Gary Kelly","Yes. And what we don\u2019t do is we don\u2019t very much by day of week. And that is something that we have on our to-do list to get better at that. We do vary by day of week but not as much as we know we could. So that\u2019s something that\u2019s an opportunity for us respectively.","Operator","We will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker","Gary, I have a question for you about Huston and Dallas specifically. With oil prices up $20 in the last five or six months, are you seeing better system traffic out of those two locations than perhaps elsewhere on the network?","Gary Kelly","Well, Midland is the one that\u2019s so easy to see plus or minus and it\u2019s really strong. I will say after this really tumultuous time in the energy markets over the past three to four years, we just haven't suffered in our energy markets like you\u2019re remembering decades ago. So it has been interesting. And of course you\u2019ve also seen the U.S. oil and gas activity has a collapse. They managed their way pretty effectively to $50 crude oil. So I don\u2019t -- Andrew, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve seen a very significant variation there.","I think what you see in a more pronounced way is where there's just a lot of competitive activity, and that of course is out in the west. And Texas is an entity and Houston Dallas specifically both look very strong. And again, I don\u2019t know that I would attribute that to a change in the last quarter of oil prices up 10 bucks a barrel, I don\u2019t think that that activity is fluctuated all that much.","Andrew Watterson","Over the long horizon both states have become much more economically diversified -- and even Houston itself with how it's been with Southside of town with significant medical industry in the Southside town continues with the economy.","Helane Becker","And then just a question on Hawaii. Tammy you made a comment in your prepared remarks about bit of a headwind with ETOPS qualifications et cetera for this year. I mean is that given how big the airline is and the comments that you guys just made about more diversification. Is that just de minimis cost or will we actually see that in the numbers?","Tammy Romo","Helane, it's de minis, yes and I was referring to -- that was just the investment for to get started in Hawaii and the spend related to ETOPS. So I just want to be clear. We're on track with respect to ETOPS. So it's all green at least at this point with respect to our plans to start service to Hawaii. And yes, the spins related to that is really is that significant.","Gary Kelly","I was just going to give an update on the when, that while I agree with Tammy that we're on track with our work plan, we're just now -- that means that we're at the point where we've submitted to the FAA an application. And now the work begins with the FAA, if you will, although we've been partnering very well with them on the application up to this point.","So we don't have any further update today on when we might be publishing and when we might be flying. Our goal is to do both this year but I think we're all very confident that we'll at least be selling by the end of this year. But there's really no more information to offer other than we were at least on track but are all work plan to this point.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Tammy, I just want to come back to the comment about margins. When you say margins that\u2019s including the hedge gains and losses year-on-year, right?","Tammy Romo","That's right. To be very clear, yes.","Brandon Oglenski","So if we were to back out the hedge loss last year the hedge gains this year then we\u2019re probably going to be flat to down on margins, right?","Tammy Romo","Are you talking 20\u2026.","Brandon Oglenski","Right, well that's for us to do, I know you haven't guided for that. So I guess my question is with your RASM guidance for the first quarter. When do we start to realize the benefits from the reservation system? And can you talk through what those are again. Because I know we had some negative impacts on the implementation in 3Q and 4Q. I think you guys said on your last call that it should have been out of the run rate of revenue by now. So can you give us an update on how we should see that progress through the year?","Tammy Romo","Sure, I'd be happy to. We don't have exact numbers to give you there, but certainly directionally, the impact here in first quarter we're not expecting that to be significant at all. And then as we move into the second quarter, we should start seeing some benefits but we\u2019ll just be picking up some theme there. And then really the bulk of the benefit will be in the second half of the year.","So I am hesitant to throw out any numbers, because we're in the middle of all of this. But by the second quarter, we're hopefully ramping up to something more in the $50 million plus range and then with the bulk of the benefit again coming in the second half.","Gary Kelly","Let me clarify here your margin question though. The guidance that Tammy offered up and then I offered up is just CASM, excluding all the items would be flat to down, number one. Number two, then -- so it excludes fuel. So then number two, we told you that we\u2019re at a positive revenue outlook for the first quarter, and that\u2019s our goal for the year.","So that margin expansion is coming without fuel. So we\u2019re fuel -- and I was careful to mention that fuel prices, it was excluding fuel prices. So you\u2019ll have to factor fuel prices. And on a hedge basis then to determine the operating margin effect of that. But based on futures prices right now, we would have margin expansion.","Brandon Oglenski","And I understand that and I guess that would be my follow up question. I mean it\u2019s been a tough two days for airline stocks here. What I\u2019m insinuating is that if we back out the hedges like if we just took you to market rates on fuel, it\u2019s pretty tough to get margins up if not even down this year. And that\u2019s the case for a lot of airlines\u2026","Gary Kelly","No, that\u2019s not what I said. I said without fuel, our margins would be up. So I think in other words as keeping fuel constant or however you want to think about it, our margins would be up. CASM ex-fuel right now is -- our guidance that we gave you is flat to down and RASM, the goal is positive. That means margin expansion without fuel.","Brandon Oglenski","Maybe that\u2019s on apples-to-apples here, but the input cost underlying all this right has gone up a lot. So I think what investors are looking for is and I don\u2019t want you to comment about other airlines, obviously, but what are expectations for how does the industry adapt to an underlying higher cost structure. And when should we start to see that. Because if I go through the -- your capacity growth is about the same as you\u2019ve been effectively guiding you not for maybe the past three or four quarters. But obviously the underlying cost of business has come up a lot. So what should be the proper investor expectations for when we start to see some adaptations here, what is fundamentally a higher cost structure now?","Gary Kelly","I understand. So obviously we\u2019re not in line with the rest of the industry. We have a better outlook than they do, superior margins, superior returns. And what they will do, I can\u2019t tell you. So I don\u2019t know. What we\u2019re going to do is what we\u2019ve shared with you we think we have a very superb position and outlook for this year. And again I\u2019m very excited about the prospects for 2018. We should see operating margin expansion, given the current outlook for fuel prices, and then it will be even easier for us because of the tax reform to see even better net margin expansion.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Tammy, two questions, one is just on the CapEx for the year. When you indicate your aircraft CapEx would be eight, back down to\u2026","Tammy Romo","Michael, you\u2019re breaking up a little bit there. Would you mind trying that again?","Michael Linenberg","I was asking about CapEx. And I think you\u2019re guiding to $1.9 billion. And I think you indicated today that the aircraft piece is $1 billion. When we go back to January, when you had your 8-K, I think you indicated that it was a little bit less -- it was going to less than $1 billion. So maybe there is some rounding there. So when I look at the non-aircraft piece, knowing that you did push I think $115 million into '18. It still seems like that that\u2019s a pretty high non-aircraft piece. Normally, I think you\u2019re in that $500 million $600 million range when you don\u2019t have big projects underway. So I was just curious what's driving that, call it $900 million, $900 million plus of non-aircraft CapEx?","Tammy Romo","The non-aircraft CapEx, we\u2019re seeing -- actually our technology CapEx, we\u2019re expecting that to be down a little bit due to the completion of the One Res. And we\u2019re seeing a little higher mix of our technology spend hitting OpEx. So that\u2019s impacting that. Where we\u2019re seeing the increase is really more in facilities. And we have some plans related to some of our hangers that\u2019s impacting that and some investments relating to our pilots training facility, so that\u2019s up a little bit. So we\u2019re seeing our technology down little bit, but that\u2019s being offset by an increase in facility. So those are the major drivers there.","Michael Linenberg","So those are the big ones. And then just on the unit cost guide to be up flat to down, and I know last quarter you said you felt confident about flat. And since then, the only thing that I can think that has changed is that we had the fourth quarter bump up in '17 on the employee cost, and I think that was like 3.5 points. Is that the primary difference between the guidance today versus where we were a quarter ago? Or there are couple other things that maybe you are hoping to drive a better CASM outlook?","Tammy Romo","You really nailed it, Mike. There is really nothing significant from the last update that we provided. But as you already noted, we did have higher expense due to the employee tax reform benefit. So that made our comps a little bit easier but we have to rebound that still really -- I think our comps outlook for this year is very solid. And as ever, we are very focused on our cost and we\u2019ll continue to be very diligent there in our cost control efforts. But that\u2019s the primary driver from our previous guidance.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Gary, a question for you. You\u2019ve obviously seen the announcement by United, and they seem to be pushing little more aggressively in some important markets to you. Is that something that investors should be concerned about? Or do you think that maybe they are looking at a different type of passenger than you are focused on, and so there shouldn\u2019t be much of an impact?","Gary Kelly","Well, admittedly anytime flights are added or flights are subtracted from a market, there is an impact. So I wouldn\u2019t want to ever \u2013 try to put one past to you. It\u2019s just not truthful to say that. So adding capacity will definitely dilute some traffic. But I think back to the future there with Jaime's opening question, we focus on nonstop, low fare traffic, and a high cost legacy airline does not. And there are many, many historic examples where we might have a share of seeds in a market, but a significantly higher share of traffic in that market. And again it's because they don't want to fill up their segments with low fare customers at the expense of choking off the higher fare opportunities that they have with the connecting passenger through their hub.","In your life time, we've gone from being a very small player in Texas to the largest airline in the country, fundamentally based on what I just described. It is a cost advantage that translates to a fare advantage and we generate a dramatic number of customers, over 130 million for last year. And Tom I think that's the second largest in the world.","So the markets that I recall that they spiked out, we have a very significant presence in. In one case we have a different airport and I would argue an airport advantage. So will it impact us? Yes. Will it harm Southwest Airlines? It's bold talk. But we should always be humble and always respectful of our competitors and we are in this case. But I think we have all the tools we need to continue to perform well in every market that were impacted.","And I just will remind you that 10 years ago we were barely starting in Denver, and 12 years later, we're the number one airline in terms of the number of passengers in Denver. So I kind of rest my case. In this case, you\u2019ve got legacy carriers who were not prepared, went bankrupt, shrunk, they shed cost and are using that as a strategy and now an opportunity when times are better to try to reclaim some that they lost and gave up. And that will be very, very hard battle for them.","Rajeev Lalwani","And then just another quick one for you, just maybe for Tammy. You talked about just dollars from tax reform, et cetera. Should we take that to mean that the capital -- the CapEx number that you put out for this year, maybe the floor and maybe we should look to -- for that number to either move up or stay where it is going forward?","Tammy Romo","Well, we will -- it's not going to -- I guess, it wouldn\u2019t go down from here, we'll start there. But we\u2019ve given you all of our plans at least so far. And just pointing back to what Gary walked you through earlier, any opportunities on the capital side would probably be more along the lines of fleet in terms of opportunities to continue to renew our fleet. But right now, you have a order book and we are at very manageable level, but outside of making the fleet and essential opportunities there to modernize and invest in the business, in that way. But for 2018, there's really -- I think that would be our big opportunity and we'll explore that. But again, I don\u2019t know if it would have a meaningful impact on here on 2018.","Operator","That concludes the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I first like to introduce Ms. Laurie Barnett, Managing Director of Communications and Outreach.","Laurie Barnett","Thank you, Tom. I\u2019d like to welcome members of the media to our call today. Before we begin taking questions, Tom would you please give instructions on how everyone should queue up for question.","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll now begin with our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","Gary, you referred to uses of the tax savings. You said -- noted that compensation with your unionized employees is something that would have be negotiated. So what you\u2019re saying is that that you would not do a mid contract pay increase for your employees using some of that savings?","Gary Kelly","Well, I didn\u2019t say that. But in other words, we can. If the two parties want to negotiate, we can negotiate it anytime. I just pointing out the obvious which is, unilaterally we\u2019re not going to wage or increase wages across the board because we can\u2019t by federal law, so all that has to be negotiated.","Mary Schlangenstein","But you wouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that you could do either open negotiation to do some side agreement to a contract on increasing pay before the next contract is negotiated?","Gary Kelly","I don\u2019t see that anything is different in 2018 than ever. So we have contracts in place. They take quite an effort to negotiate. We have several contracts that are up for amendment this year, so that will obviously be the priority. So I\u2019m not suggesting, Mary, that I think all of a sudden we are or our unions would want to do that. I\u2019m just pointing out that if the two sides agree, we can always do that. And our outlook is what we\u2019ve reported and any long-term commitments we make will always be with an eye towards just trying to be prepared for the unexpected. And I think there were several questions earlier today about fuel cost increases. And I was interviewed earlier this morning about my concerns on the outlook.","And it\u2019s those kinds of things that I am mostly focused and concerned about, in other words fuel -- oil price increases and the impact that that would have. So while we have seen significant reductions in our taxes, there were always other challenges that we have out there in all those things would have to be factored into the any long term commitments that we would ever take.","Mary Schlangenstein","And just if I could clarify one thing you said. You made a comment from the 7379, and I didn\u2019t catch what you said. Did you say you might be interested in that aircraft?","Gary Kelly","I said that as it stands today, we don\u2019t have any interest in adding that aircraft to our fleet. That doesn\u2019t mean that we won't change our mind at some point. But the net of a long answer was we love the 737 MAX 8. We\u2019re working with Boeing on 737 MAX 7. I'm sure that that will be a wonderful aircraft when it\u2019s ready. And that is our focus and we\u2019re not working on anything else when it comes to the fleet, just those two.","Operator","We will take our next question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News.","Conor Shine","I am just looking for a little bit of help to understand exactly how these tax changes are going to play out over a little bit longer term. I know you guys reported that the $1.4 billion been realized from 2017. Is that of the similar magnitude you guys are expecting in 2018, 2019? Was that a one-time thing because of just the timing of these changes? How much you expected this to reduce? How much you guys pay in federal taxes, going forward?","Gary Kelly","So Conor, it\u2019s a very quick background. The tax return doesn\u2019t match our financial statements, so there\u2019s just different rules. So there is a tax liability on our books at a 35% tax rate that was related to all the years leading up to 2017. And we would have to pay that $1.4 billion based on the tax returns in the future. So since taxes are now at 21%, that\u2019s what's driving -- it's simply reducing that liability from 35% to 21%. And the cash amount for that would flow out over years in the future.","That is not a proxy for what we would save each year now prospectively. And I would just put in the -- Tammy had hundreds of millions hits, it depends on what our earnings are for 2018. But if the earnings are close to what they were in 2017 is half of billion dollars. So it\u2019s a big amount of money and I think our investors all do the arithmetic and understand that very well. But it\u2019s that order of magnitude.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with Arizona Republic.","Dawn Gilbertson","Two questions, first for Tammy. You mentioned that EarlyBird revenue totaled $100 million in the fourth quarter. And I don\u2019t remember your exact words, but you said that just to put that in perspective that was your initial target. Do you mean that\u2019s what you thought you would get annually from EarlyBird when it was introduced several years ago?","Tammy Romo","Yes, going back when I\u2019ve said. The point I was making there is that it\u2019s been very successful. It\u2019s in high demand by our customers. But yes, we at this point, was as we achieved $100 million in one quarter, which we rolled it out was our target for the full year.","Dawn Gilbertson","Is this the first time that\u2019s hit $100 million a quarter?","Tammy Romo","That\u2019s been -- yes, this is -- which is kind of popped out to me\u2026","Gary Kelly","Yes, it was. Now Dawn in fairness, we\u2019re a bigger airline today than when we launched in 2009. But still I mean it's definitely well exceeded our expectations.","Dawn Gilbertson","What about -- what's the total figure for the year on EarlyBird, Tammy?","Tammy Romo","For the full year, I will pull that for you real quick. But it would be roughly -- if you'll hang on, we'll get back and report back.","Dawn Gilbertson","And the other question related to that is, I mean any plans, you went from 12.50 -- I can\u2019t remember what started that, but I know then 12.50 and then 15. Is that likely to stay at 15 or given the success, might that be due for an increase?","Gary Kelly","Well, we have to have some secrets. We're trying to keep our costs under control. We're trying to keep our fares low. So I think we've got a good opportunity to hold firm here at least for the meantime.","Dawn Gilbertson","And then the other question Gary for you as it relates to Hawaii. And then I know you said from the very start, there was no guarantee you were going to start flying this year. But just in reading between the lines of what you just said briefly, it sounds to me like the chance are you're going to fly there this year sound very, very slim? Is that\u2026","Gary Kelly","No, I didn't intend that at all. So I think our goal has been from the offset to be flying by the end of the year. We didn't necessarily share all of that with you, but that was our goal. It\u2019s not -- achieving that goal is not totally within our control. I think what is actually encouraging is that in terms of the work that we do control, we are right on target. And Mike we're what six months into this, and I guess three months after our announcement. So we are well underway. I think there's a chance that we can be flying by the end of the year and that will be our goal. I think what we're much more confident in saying is that we'll be at least selling by the end of the year. But I don't think that we're less likely to be flying than we have been. If anything, we maybe more likely just because we know now what we've been able to get done over the past six months.","Dawn Gilbertson","Where would you put the chances of flying this year at?","Gary Kelly","I can't -- I don't know how to do that. Because again, we're working with the federal government, and now we'll be dependent upon their timetable and then they may come up with work that we may be underestimated. So I just don't know that there's any way to handicap that. But what I'm told our team is in the grand scheme of things, whether we're flying late this year or early next year, it won't matter over the next generation. I think mainly we want to do this work; we want to do it; we want to do it well; we want to watch when everything is all lined up. And if we get it done, and we\u2019re up and flying by the end of this year, I'll be happy. I think everybody will be. If we don't, it won't be the end of the world.","Dawn Gilbertson","When is the next schedule extension after February 15th?","Gary Kelly","Roughly 60 days later.","Dawn Gilbertson","Will that\u2026","Gary Kelly","I would call that April 15th.","Dawn Gilbertson","Will that fix you through the end of the year?","Gary Kelly","No, probably takes into November, I would guess.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We take that question from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly.","Robert Silk","Gary, can you talk to me about the fixed appeal of Paine Field. Is there anything other than just the fact that Sea Tac is constrained, or does that bring more to the table than that?","Gary Kelly","I do think it brings more to the table. It\u2019s attractive from a handful of aspects. So one is we\u2019re really good at applying to alternative airports. And if you have low cost and low fares, it helps people become aware of that option. And so it is bringing something new in that sense, so I\u2019m forgetting the Sea Tac for a second. And the second thing is there is a significant pool of customers north of the city that just ground traffic constraints are such that if they have more convenient flight option, I think that they will take that. And we\u2019ve seen that benefit again throughout our 46 year history, if we can provide a more convenient airport, and I think that sort of hit several criteria. This airport is going to be by definition a lot smaller, and I think for customers. And there is -- if there is -- that\u2019s a more pleasurable experience in some ways. You don\u2019t have as many flight options, which is drawback sometimes but really small airport.","But all those things I think are very meaningful. But you hit on it on the point also, which is Sea Tac for us, we\u2019re constrained and we do want to increase our presence in the Seattle Metro area, and this is a really good opportunity for us to do that. And then finally there is only five daily departures left with what the airport has planned for in terms of real estate, I think they\u2019ve got two gates. So if we don\u2019t move on this, we may likely lose the opportunity. And we\u2019ll certainly be able to accommodate five more round trips with our capacity plans. So I\u2019m excited about it. It\u2019s something that two years ago really wasn\u2019t on our radar. And I think it will be a nice opportunity and a real plus for our customers than the Seattle Metro area.","Robert Silk","Just one quick follow up. The five left for the five year taking, or is it those five plus five more?","Gary Kelly","My understanding is that this takes the airport to 24 daily departures and that is the capacity that they have built. So it\u2019s not a governmental constraint, it is just the practical capacity of the terminal.","Operator","And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Ms. Laurie Barnett for any additional or closing remarks.","Laurie Barnett","Thank you, Tom. I\u2019m going to turn it back to Tammy to provide that answer regarding EarlyBird.","Tammy Romo","Yes. Dawn, it was just that $400 million for the full year.","Gary Kelly","That\u2019s convenient.","Laurie Barnett","Excellent. Well members of the media, if you have any other questions, our communications group is standing by at 214-792-4847. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining."],"19370":["Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 25, 2013 12:30 PM ET","Executives","Marcy Brand","Gary C.

My name is Tom, and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call to discuss our second quarter results. Joining me on the call today is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and President of AirTran Airways; and Mike Van De Ven, Executive Vice President and COO. Today's call will begin with opening comments from Gary, followed by Tammy providing review of our second quarter results and current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy's remarks.","Please be advised that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current intents, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","And now I'll turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary C. Kelly","Marcy, thank you very much. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report a strong second quarter earnings performance, and we had record earnings, record earnings per share, record revenues. The first half results are records as well. As with a year ago, we produced very strong operating and net margins and strong returns on capital. Our cash flow from operations was also very strong, and we were able to repurchase $251 million worth of stock, as well as quadrupling the quarterly dividend.","The domestic economy was worse than what we had assumed in our second quarter plan. And really, that's for the fourth year in a row. Fuel prices were nicely below plan and that provided a nice offset at least. So to start with, I want to thank all of our employees for a very strong quarterly performance. I also want to thank them for the tremendous progress that we're making on our strategic plan and especially our 5 strategic initiatives. So just to mention those very quickly, as we have outlined in the press release, we're on track with our AirTran integration. We've got the networks connected. We've got city conversions well underway and aircraft conversions well underway. And the retirement of the Boeing 717s began this next month, also as planned. As far as our All-New Rapid Rewards program that we've rolled out in 2011, we're continuing to see very strong results and a very strong performance from that new program. On the 737-800 front, we have 43 of those units on hand in the fleet as of the end of the quarter, on track to hit 54 by the end of the year. They are performing as expected, producing higher than system load factors, which is a real tribute to our scheduling. And for the quarter, they were a meaningful profit contributor, also ahead of our plan.","Next, we have our fleet modernization initiatives, which, for the second quarter, was principally the Evolve retrofit on the -700s and the -300s. And that was also a very significant contributor and also ahead of plan. So all told, the fleet modernization initiatives, along with the -800s, contributed $89 million of incremental revenue in the quarter.","And then finally, our initiative to implement a new reservation system, beginning with international reservations technology, continues. It is right on track and planned for implementation in 2014. We have a major technical milestone on that project this fall, and I suspect we'll provide a more in-depth update on the project at that point.","The only 2013 project that is off track is our O&D revenue management system. Technology was delivered on time as planned, but the results from that new product are not what we really want and need. So we're redirecting that effort and still expect to drive a significant benefit, but not until we have a revised approach with that in 2014.","So having said all that, again, the economy has been worse than what was assumed in our plan. That has impacted our performance, and it may continue to, and that simply reinforces our very careful outlook with regards to capacity and fleet expansion. We lowered our expectations regarding 2014's available seat miles, for example. We have significant opportunities to grow the network after next year, with the repeal of the Wright Amendment and the introduction of international capabilities. And of course, those opportunities are in Dallas and in Houston and really to all points in North America.","So our financial priorities continue, and they are to achieve and sustain a minimum of 15% pretax return on invested capital, reduce our balance sheet leverage and maintain investment-grade credit ratings, maintain a total liquidity, on average at least, of $3.5 billion, including our line of credit, and of course, continue to enhance shareholder value.","So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy Romo.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Gary, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In spite of the weak revenue environment, our second quarter net income, excluding special items, of $274 million was a record performance. Our earnings per share of $0.38 was in line with consensus expectations, and that's up 6% from last year's record results. To achieve these results with all the strategic initiatives we currently have underway took much hard work, and I would like to join Gary in recognizing our employees for their outstanding efforts during the quarter.","Our revenues for the quarter were an all-time high and benefited significantly from our strategic and other initiatives. We realized $95 million in net synergies during second quarter from the AirTran acquisition, with approximately 2\/3 of that coming from net revenue synergies. With the connecting capabilities now in place, we have significantly strengthened our ability to optimize the Southwest and AirTran networks. Second quarter earnings included $40 million from incremental code-share revenues, and we were obviously pleased with these results. Thus far, in July, we are also very encouraged by the bookings on new itineraries created from the ability to connect and sell across both networks. Business Select revenues were approximately $20 million, and we recognized approximately $17 million in incremental passenger revenues from our Rapid Rewards program. We're on track with our expected $300 million EBIT improvement this year from our fleet modernization efforts, with close to half of that already realized in the first half of this year. Wright Amendment revenues were also strong, producing $75 million in the second quarter. So overall, very pleased with the second quarter benefit from our initiatives that largely contributed to our record revenue performance.","On a unit basis, our revenue trends declined in the 2% range compared to second quarter last year on a 3% increase in ASMs. The increase in capacity was primarily a function of our increased gauge on our aircraft in conjunction with our fleet modernization efforts. While the 4% year-over-year increase in our seats per trip put pressure on PRASM, the significant unit cost benefit is driving our expected EBIT improvement. In response to weak industry yield environment, we launched aggressive sales to stimulate demand and that led to record second quarter traffic and strong load factors, with the yields down just a little over 2% versus second quarter last year. The weakness in yields are really across all fare categories, but our business travel trends, measured by close-in traffic, were clearly impacted. However, unit revenue trends did improve nicely throughout the quarter. April was down year-over-year 4% to 5%. May was down 2%, and June was close to down 1%. For the month of June, trends in the back half were stronger than the first half, and trends have strengthened further here in July, with the July 4 holiday being particularly strong year-over-year. Based on current bookings, we expect July's unit revenues to grow 3% year-over-year, and current bookings for August and September also were good. But please keep in mind, year-over-year comparisons will be impacted by the timing of Labor Day in this year.","Shifting to freight revenues and other revenues. Our freight revenues were also at record levels, benefiting from increased fuel surcharges and expanding our cargo network with the introduction of Southwest cargo on AirTran flights during the second quarter. Other revenues decreased 3.1% year-over-year, primarily due to lower AirTran fees as we continue to transition the AirTran network over to Southwest. EarlyBird revenues increased 30% year-over-year to $52 million, and we recognized $83 million in other fees, including $4 million from A1 through A15 premium boarding positions at the gate. We currently expect our third quarter 2013 freight and other revenues combined to decrease from third quarter 2012.","Turning to fuel. Our second quarter economic fuel price per gallon was $3.06 per gallon, which was in line with expectation, and this was 5% below second quarter's -- second quarter of last year's $3.22 per gallon, and that was driven primarily by lower jet differentials as the decrease in Brent was offset by the increase in crack spreads. Our ongoing fuel conservation and fleet modernization efforts improved our second quarter fuel burn by approximately 4% and lowered our second quarter fuel cost by approximately $50 million. Our second quarter hedging premiums were $12 million as we expected. And for third quarter, we're approximately 80% hedged, with 70% of our positions at varying Gulf Coast jet fuel equivalent prices and the majority of our protection beginning at $3.10 per gallon. Our fuel hedging premium cost for third quarter is estimated to be approximately $22 million. And based on market prices as of July 22 and our third quarter hedge position, we currently expect our third quarter 2013 economic fuel price to be in the $3.05 to $3.10 per gallon range, which is well below what we assumed for our third quarter fuel price in our 2013 plan. For the full year, based on fuel derivative contracts and current market prices, our 2013 forecasted economic jet fuel price per gallon is $3.10 to $3.15, which, again, is well below our 2013 plan, which was $3.25 to $3.30 range. And our total 2013 premiums are still estimated to be approximately $60 million, so no change there.","Our unit costs, excluding fuel special items and profit-sharing, increased 1.7% year-over-year, and this modest increase is noteworthy considering the investments we are making through fleet modernization and our other strategic initiatives. Clearly, our efforts to control our costs in accordance with our 2013 plan are working. The year-over-year increase that we saw was primarily driven by increases in salaries, wages and benefits and airport costs, and that was partially offset by lower maintenance expense. Our Evolve retrofits contributed less than 0.5 point to our second quarter cost inflation. And with our 700 retrofits now complete, the second half of this year will experience minimal cost pressure related to our Evolve retrofits.","Based on current cost trends, including our fleet modernization and other cost control efforts, we expect our third quarter unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing, to increase slightly from third quarter's 2012 $0.0772. This tracks in line with our 2013 nonfuel CASM plan that assumes a 1% year-over-year increase on our nonfuel unit costs, excluding special items and profit-sharing.","On the nonoperating cost side, our net interest expense declined year-over-year, primarily as a result of continuing to pay down debt, a trend we expect to continue in third quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We had strong cash flow generation during the quarter to end with $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. Through the first half of 2013, we generated over $1 billion of free cash flow. And in May, we made several announcements that acted on what we communicated at our December Investor Day in regards to our focus on aggressively managing our invested capital and seeking ways to return value to our shareholders with our cash flow generation.","As Gary mentioned, our Board of Directors quadrupled our quarterly dividend and increased our share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion, and the authorization included an accelerated June repurchase program which was completed in June. Our repurchases under the ASR program totaled $250.5 million or approximately 18 million shares. Through the first half of 2013, we returned $394 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and over $1 billion since May 2011.","We made approximately $50 million of debt payments during the second quarter, and we have approximately $100 million in debt and capital lease scheduled payments for the remainder of the year. Our $314 million of total debt payments planned this year includes $139 million of prepayments for AirTran's aircraft backed secured loans made this year. Based on our scheduled debt payments, our leverage, including off balance sheet aircraft leases, is expected to decline to the high 30% range by year end. And there has been no change to our 2013 capital spending forecast, which remains in the $1.4 billion range.","Before we open it up for questions, I'll provide a quick recap of our fleet and capacity plans. Thus far, we've taken delivery of 9 of 18 planned -800 firm orders and 2 leased -700 aircraft. And on the retirement side, we are still expecting to transfer 16- 717s to Delta this year. And combined with our Classic retirement schedule, we continue to manage to a relatively flat fleet.","On the capacity side, we continue to expect our 2013 available seat mile capacity to increase modestly in the 2% year-over-year range. And for 2014, we currently plan to keep capacity in line with this year. We're on track with our plan to implement Southwest international reservation system by the end of next year, and we will then be able to complete the transition of our AirTran -700s while continuing to transition the 717s out of our fleet, all this while continuing to retire our less fuel-efficient Classic fleet. Overall, 2014, we'll see a lot of movement within our fleet composition. However, we remain focused on keeping our fleet relatively flat in 2013.","In conclusion, we're making great progress on our 2013 plan. And while revenues in the first half were softer than planned, recent revenue trends are encouraging. Our strategic initiatives are largely on track with our 2013 plan with one exception: migration of the O&D revenue management system has begun as planned. However, we're not yet fully comfortable with the results being produced versus our current method. So we've chosen to continue our cautious rollout in a way that is even more gradual than we originally anticipated. As a result, we're currently expecting sizable incremental revenue benefit to fall in 2014 rather than 2013, which is what we originally planned.","That said, our 2013 plan assume many of our other strategic initiatives would contribute more significantly in the back half of this year. Further, our efforts to control our unit costs are working, and fuel prices remain below last year and below our plan. Again, our 2013 plan assumes fuel prices higher than we are currently running and a stronger economic environment than we've experienced thus far. Together, these trends have created a potential shortfall against our plan. While our outlook on the second half of the year is encouraging, our first half results were significantly impacted by the economic weakness, which makes our ability to achieve our 15% pretax return on invested capital plan this year more challenging and less likely. However, we are not giving up nor losing focus on our plan. And our expected results for the first half of the year, while short of our plan, are solid and provide great momentum. Based on our current outlook, while we may not hit our 15% by year end, we are making excellent progress, and we will not stop until we reach our goals.","And with that, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question, which comes from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, in some of your remarks, you kind of mentioned a pattern of sort of economic weakness weighing on results and surprising you. I'm just curious, when you think about the customer segment that you serve, the nature of that segment, do you get the sense -- or do you have the feeling that there are any kind of structural or secular kind of overhangs on that segment in particular within the context of the economy? Because after all, we have seen positive GDP growth. It's admittedly been sluggish, but has been positive for the last few years. And we have seen it seemingly weigh on Southwest a bit more than peers. So I was just hopeful that you could kind of comment on that and maybe give some perspective.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes. Thanks for the question. I -- well, first of all, I guess, just taking some of your thoughts in reverse, I wouldn't agree that it's weighing on Southwest any different than anybody else. There's a long string of years, including most of the 4-year period that I was referring to in terms of the economic sluggishness where we outperformed the rest of the industry. And I think Tammy mentioned in the way that you're thinking about how we compare right now, just make sure that you take into account the increase in the seats per departure that's going on right now. So that's a good 4% to 5% increase and creates at least an arithmetic drag on RASM comparatively. So the only point of all of that is, I don't see that we're out of step at all with the industry. If anything, over the last 5 years, we've outperformed. With respect to what secular changes might be taking place right now, I don't know that I really see anything going on there. At least what we can report to you is that our trends were very solid and stable on unit revenue growth perspective, dating back to, I would call it, September as a starting point and all the way through most of February. And then we were off of our sequential trends, taking into account seasonality and the timing of Easter holidays, et cetera, beginning in March, and we really haven't regained a trend relative to that previous period since. Now we've seen some encouraging signs here in July. But Tammy, I don't know that I would say that July, relative to June, is a lot better than our normal June to July trend over history. So it's -- even though we're seeing a nice comp to a year-ago July, it's not like the June, July trend is spectacular. I think the weakness is twofold. I think it's both in the government\/business travel segment, as well as consumers. So we had a record monthly load factor for the month of June at 85%. But Bob Jordan and his team had us on sale quite a bit to drive that traffic. So I guess the bottom line, John, is no, I don't think there's anything that's all that's unique going on here. I think relative to a longer-term comparison, maybe 10 or 20 years, there's no question that the traffic in short-haul markets is less today than it used to be. So I think that's probably the only thought that comes to mind about a secular change. And I'm not ready to predict that the short-haul markets won't show improvement in the next decade. But clearly, the growth within the airline business over the last decade has been in longer-haul trips, which is why we are pivoting more at Southwest towards longer versus short trips. And the medium-haul markets, sort of around 1,000 miles, interestingly enough, are relatively flat over the past 10 to 15 years. So absent that, which I would attribute more to increased fares because of increased fuel costs, I don't really see anything going on right now that would suggest some dramatic change. We've got the federal sequestration and other debt ceiling fight looming, and I think we've all got to be very mindful of that and assessing what happens to air travel demand. So all of that uncertainty, along with higher taxes this year, I don't think it's any shock. As you said, I don't think it's -- actually, we weren't shocked that the GDP was weaker. Our point was simply that we built a -- an annual plan. We have to make assumptions, so we made an assumption about the economy. We made an assumption about fuel prices. And one of those is a good guy and one of them is a bad guy relative to our plan.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. I'm just curious. I think it's fair to say that your average customer is a bit more price-sensitive than maybe the average customer of a legacy airline. Do you think that degree of elasticity is potentially kind of a headwind on the margin when we find ourselves in a situation where the industry price umbrella continues to go higher? Is there kind of a volume drop-off that we need to think about as those prices go up that might impact you more than others? Just your thoughts there would be helpful.","Gary C. Kelly","I don't know, John. Again, I don't know that I'd buy that, at least in 2013. Maybe that argument made more sense in 1975. But fares aren't cheap for a lot of Americans. And so -- even though we're a low-cost, low-fare carrier and that could be where a lot of the short-haul traffic has gone. So we're the largest airline in America by a wide margin, so we have a very broad appeal across the United States. And I just don't see the argument that our customers are more price-sensitive. By that definition, we -- I think you would see a lot more volatility in our traffic. We can get the traffic as we can prove. We grew our available seat miles 3%, and we filled them up there in June. So I think bottom line, no. Now in a more macro sense, we -- you and we know that we're a low-fare brand, and we work harder to be lower than everybody else. And close to the majority of the time, that's going to be the case when people shop for Southwest Airlines. But those are still fares that -- they're just not as low as they used to be for all the reasons that we know.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","So just this one question. Do you prefer higher yields or higher load factors?","Gary C. Kelly","I think that one's easy. I think because we're a -- we start with serving our customers and think of ourselves as a low-fare brand, clearly, we want to be the lowest fare going. I think all of us would admit, if you ask Mike Van De Ven, our operator who's sitting here, he would say it's certainly easier to manage an operation when the airplanes aren't quite as full. But that -- I think that's probably overthinking it a bit, and clearly, we want to be the low-fare brand with the best customer service. So we like full airplanes.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then -- so then you would prefer higher load factors would be your -- kind of your answer, right?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Yes. And then can you speak to -- I think your comment that you're, by far, the largest airline in the U.S., can you speak to regionally what you're seeing? Is there like -- ergo, are you seeing better strength in your, maybe, core Dallas, Texas, West Coast markets than you're seeing in the Northeast or other markets? I mean, is there something that maybe you see shares shifting or something like that, that would account for some of your, maybe, disappointment on your first half?","Gary C. Kelly","No, no. I'd -- and again, my disappointment is in the economy. The -- in terms of what -- I think we would be comfortable sharing, for competitive reasons, the markets that are in more of a transition from AirTran through some step process into Southwest. Those are the ones that are in more development. So if you think about the Atlanta, Baltimore, Milwaukee where there's a lot of change taking place, those markets are not performing as strong as markets that aren't affected by that kind of transition. That's very clear. The other thing that I would mention is that, and we've shared this before, the government travel, which is defined -- I'm defining as a customer flying on the government fare, so it's something that we can readily identify, that traffic is down dramatically. And Bob, I think you said as much as 50% at times. So I think a rule of thumb, Helane, would be down 35%. So there are markets where we do see some weakness along the East Coast where you can sense that there's a lot of the military or government travel beyond what we can actually track on the fare, and that does seem to support that. But I think we all know that sequestration is real. I spend a lot of time in Washington and they are definitely managing through cuts. And beyond that, I would say that the regions look pretty consistent across the country.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. The only other question I have is in -- is I think you guys have $1.5 billion share repurchase program in place, right? I don't know how far you are on it. But that's 15% of the market cap of your company. And yet the market doesn't seem to care. They don't seem to react to that, maybe. So maybe a dividend or a bigger dividend is more of the right answer. I don't know. What do you think about that?","Gary C. Kelly","I've got a lot of thoughts on that. First of all, the stock is up nicely in a 1-year period, so there has been a move. Pinpointing it to the cause is probably multiple reasons for that. But number one, the stock has performed over the last 12 months. We're managing our balance sheet. We're managing our liquidity. And it is a -- what you're saying is true. It's a testament to the strength of the -- the financial strength of the company. And through the toughest of times, we've been able to repurchase how many shares over the past 5 years? 100 million? I mean, there is a significant amount of shareholder value that's been created. And Helane, again, when you say that, you look at our valuation relative to our peers, and the valuation is still very strong at Southwest Airlines. So I wouldn't conclude that we're not being rewarded. And it's just a matter of -- as to our shareholders being rewarded enough. We do have a $1.5 billion share repurchase. We've done about 2\/3 of that so we've got about $500 million to go. I think all that is in the release, maybe it's $525 million or so.","Tammy Romo","Yes, yes, we're at $976 million or 100 million shares.","Gary C. Kelly","Right, so we've got $0.5 billion plus to go. We have, as you know, we have increased the dividend in 2 steps. We've been paying a dividend at Southwest since the 1970s. We've stepped it up about -- I think we've doubled it last year. I know we've quadrupled it this year. So the yield is very respectable. It's over a point, somewhere in the 1.2, 1.3 range. But -- so that's just the background to your question. I think the answer specifically is we're going to continue to monitor both of those, and with the primary focus being on hitting our return on capital. We're being very aggressive in the way we're managing the invested capital of the company on the denominator side and have some very nice opportunities here to modernize the fleet and still access the preowned market, which is just a lot more capital efficient these days. Plus we'd love to take new deliveries from Boeing once the MAX is available. So all those levers are being monitored and pulled where we can. And like Tammy summarized, I think we're making outstanding progress. And I think our folks are doing a great job on all those fronts.","Tammy Romo","Helane, I wanted to make sure you have all the numbers that you were wanting there. Just to summarize real quickly, under our $1.5 billion authorization, we're at $976 million, which is 100 million shares. And over the last 5 years, we're at 220 million shares.","Gary C. Kelly","Great, okay.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Gary, I want to go back to -- you made the comment on the O&D system. I guess the implementation didn't go as well, and then it won't be ready until 2014. What -- when in 2014? And can you just elaborate on that, like, what happened? Or was it just the rollout, it meshed with your system or...","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, I'd love to, and again, I think the -- and Bob Jordan is going to describe this, but the way we think about it, Mike, is the technology was delivered, but it's not a technology or a system thing. We're trying to change from a segment-based revenue management system to an O&D revenue management system and with the understanding that going to O&D dramatically complicates the predictability of the revenue. And so I'm going to let Bob talk about that for a few minutes and at least perhaps explain better what pieces we are confident that we can deploy as we continue to, I would call it not experiment, but just run in parallel the segment system compared to the O&D system. Right now, in other words, it's not a failure. What we're proving is that our current system works actually very well and better than the new system, although again there's some really good things that we want to get from the new system. So Bob, you want to answer Mike's question now?","Robert E. Jordan","Mike, the O&D system is really a couple of things. There's a new forecaster, so that's the ability to provide better data on just demand, and that piece is going really well. We're seeing at least what we expected or maybe even a little better in terms of having better data to predict the demand, and then therefore, obviously managing that better and producing a better result. So that's going very well. The second piece is then using that data to now manage, as Gary said, the flight demand on an O&D basis versus a segment basis, so use the new system to manage the inventory buckets and all that. That's a piece that's a lot trickier, and there's a lot of science in it. And we've got a number of dates that are being run by the new system. And we just want to watch across the demand curve, be a little cautious here and make sure that the new system is managing the inventory buckets and at the end of the day, producing a better result than our current system. A lot of what it's doing is validating that the current system is pretty darn good, but I've got confidence that the new system will be even better. We just want to be cautious here because there's a lot at stake. And we've got a number of days in test. And so I do expect a modest benefit here in 2013 and then the full benefit we've talked to you about before in 2014. So I expect this fall we'll see those test dates prove up and then we'll move into a broader implementation here late this year and early in 2014. But the larger driver of the value, actually, the better forecaster and that part is going very, very well.","Gary C. Kelly","Mike, I think one of the challenges that we were warned about is that our O&D combinations are -- they're not infinite, but they are so great and so complex compared to a hub and spoke carrier, that -- and we're finding this. We're finding that we're just not certain yet that, that aspect of this technology will prove to be better than what we've got. But like Bob was saying, there are some wonderful pieces of the technology that will prove to be beneficial and will be deployed. And whatever Tammy say is that we think the value is still what we have hung our hat on here, which is, I think, $100 million.","Tammy Romo","That's right.","Gary C. Kelly","It just won't come now until we take a little bit different approach with the deployment of the system, and the benefits simply get deferred to 2014.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Gary, I would say I don't think there's ever been an O&D system adopted by a carrier with as dense a route network as yours.","Gary C. Kelly","You are exactly right, sir.","Robert E. Jordan","That's exactly right. We're really first primarily point-to-point carrier trying -- making the move to an O&D system. So it's -- it is very complicated.","Gary C. Kelly","We may be able to get 80% of the benefit, in other words, without going full up on O&D. But anyway, we're working through that and I'm -- what you haven't had happen is the Classic airline bust by moving to the new system. So we haven't done that, and obviously, I'm very pleased about that.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just one second one. You talked about a milestone technology that you would achieve in the fall, but maybe it's something you can't elaborate on. Or can you tell us what that's about? Or is that under wraps?","Gary C. Kelly","All I meant there -- no, no, I was talking about the international system and that we have a major technical milestone related to that this fall. And I think that would be an appropriate time for us to consider a more robust update for you all. Right now, we haven't told you a whole lot about the system or about when things will be sold and flown, et cetera, and it's just a little bit premature for that. But we're making good progress, right along our time line. If we meet that milestone in the fall, it will obviously be up to Tammy, but that's the next major event with that project.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Hey, I want to ask you about some of the activity you've made on the -- some of the change you've made on the AirTran network on the fee side since December. You announced some higher bag fees for AirTran there. And then just last month, you raised change fees at AirTran. I'm wondering if you could tell me sort of what you've seen in terms of changes -- some behavioral changes since those fees came on. And maybe at a higher level, are you experimenting here? Or if not, maybe just help me explain sort of the rationale for trying something like this.","Gary C. Kelly","Thank you, Hunter. I think, no. I'll just again kind of take your points in reverse. No, we're not experimenting. I think what we are -- well, simply, what we're doing is managing 2 different brands on this -- during this transition period until we can ultimately fold AirTran into Southwest. Now having said that, I would agree with the direction of your thought, which is there are things to be learned by having a different brand and having fees. And clearly, we're trying to make those -- provide those insights and make those assessments and judgments while we have AirTran operating separately. The other noise though, Hunter, that's taking place during this year is we've now connected the networks. And if you -- because of the Southwest brand and the no fees approach, if you do -- would have -- if you understand it, I'm sure you do, the code-share. So on the marketing carrier side of this, we don't charge those fees. So you do have AirTran itineraries booked through Southwest where there are no bag fees any longer. And that is really distorting the -- you don't have a clean laboratory environment here to evaluate the revenue potential from a bag fee, in fairness to your question. Now trying to go back in time a bit and evaluate AirTran performance with fees versus Southwest performance without, there's no question that the Southwest without approach has been superior. And that was one of the main value drivers in acquiring AirTran in the first place, is that they underperform on a revenue basis compared to Southwest, and that's certainly proved to be true since we've owned them.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Very helpful. And a question for you as to sort of how you hedge fuel. Do you -- I noticed you've loaded up on the hedges a little bit after the first quarter. You kind of went through the year without much hedge protection. Do you decide to buy more hedges when you see weakness in your demand, sort of with the anticipation that weaker bookings are going to sort of forecast a weaker energy price environment or vice versa? Because it feels like the hedging strategy some is pretty dynamic. Do you look at the 2 together? Do you look at one as the leading indicator of the other?","Gary C. Kelly","No. I think it is simply trying to -- again, the industry has an array of risks, and we try our best to identify what the enterprise risks are and then deploy mitigation techniques that are cost-effective. We have a hedging program, which philosophically is viewed as insurance. So we try to spend no more than what we would spend on aviation insurance coverage in terms of premiums. And that's a significant element of answering your question. And then just like we do in insurance and what you would do at home, if insurance is cheaper, it's an opportunity to buy more. If you want to think about it that way, it's certainly the way we manage our aviation insurance. When it gets more expensive, then you might try to manage that cost by taking on a little bit more risk. Said simply, you might have a larger deductible. So we'll think about hedging opportunities in that way. I don't see that they are as directly linked to the revenue environment for one simple reason. We're in the business of flying airplanes. We have to have jet fuel to fly. So it's not a reach to say that we know we're going to be buying jet fuel in 2014, and therefore, we ought to be looking for opportunities to protect ourselves on price. We are in this wonderful environment right now where the market is significantly backwardated [ph]. I'm not enough of an expert to -- I'm not an expert, but I'm not enough of a student to know whether this is a record level of backwardation, particularly with the Brent market, but it does present interesting opportunities if you go out into the futures market. The 2013 was real simple. We went through a roller coaster already this year. And I bet you our fuel price budget -- no, not budget, but forecast for the year has swung well over $1 billion from peak to trough. So we had opportunities to load up some coverage at a very low cost and protect our AOP, if you will, and that's what you saw taking place, I suspect, from some point to some point. But yes, we're 80% hedged here in the third quarter, and I believe, Tammy, we're 85% in the fourth?","Tammy Romo","That's right. And one other thing, just a note to -- in response to your question, Hunter. We did, as you pointed out, we did lighten our fuel hedge for the third quarter to 80%. And with that move, we locked in a $0.01 gain, which is, of course, reflected in the guidance that we gave you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Tammy, have you given us your expectations for 2014 CapEx?","Tammy Romo","We've given you our aircraft CapEx, which is $1.2 billion.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And what do you typically assume over that level?","Tammy Romo","Well, what we have here in 2013, we haven't given you 2014's, but just as a benchmark, we're about $0.5 billion here in 2013. We'll confirm that out for you later this year.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Appreciate that. And I just want to ask you, it's not a big needle mover in terms of revenue, but I believe you had announcement around live TV in the quarter. And if I follow this logic correctly, at one point, you were charging it -- charging for it along with WiFi and then you moved to sort of a free model with a partner there, so that probably cannibalizes some from your WiFi product offering. I'm just wondering, how do you think about sort of that value proposition to the customer? It seems like it could be an opportunity to charge for something. And how do you think about sort of giving more value and what does Southwest get in return?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, the -- first of all, I think we did about $5 million in revenues, and that doesn't speak to the cost of providing the WiFi during the quarter. So there's a $5 million revenue benefit, and that was a significant increase from a year ago, although again, it's still a relatively small number. And so it speaks to the point, which is the take rates are still are pretty modest. The live -- our TV offering is a promotion, so we are not telling you that it is free into infinity. And that is a partner arrangement that we have with DISH. So it is obviously intended to drive trial and the television product is awesome. So I think we're hopeful that people will try it and like it. And we're not speaking today as to whether or not it will be free into infinity or even in to 2014 for that matter. So hopefully, that answers your question.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just with respect to Atlanta, you're probably reluctant to give us this, but can you talk about sort of unit revenue growth in Atlanta versus the rest of the system? And then just use your footprint there today, how much supply are you taking down in the back half? And when does capacity cutting in Atlanta stop?","Gary C. Kelly","Sure. No, I won't answer the question about Atlanta specifically as to how it's performing. However, I will certainly tell you that it is very much in development and transition. So we have taken steps to begin the de-hubbing process and that is sometimes painful to work through because you cut off flow, as you well know. And then Bob has already published a schedule for November, which takes that final step, if you will, in AirTran to move the flight activity to be throughout the day rather than concentrated into 2 major banks. And so there is sort of a complete un-hubbing at that point. We still have a lot of connecting passengers, but it will be a shift to much more heavily weighted towards nonstop passengers. So our capacity plans are pretty well-known, I think, Bob, based on that. And what we will do with Atlanta after that will be dependent upon the results, obviously. But -- so I can't -- at this point, I'm not really ready to handicap whether the flight activity goes up, down or stay the same. But at least with this initial step that we're taking in November, the total flight activity, Bob, is what...","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, our schedule is this fall in the 165 to 170 flights a day, which is not significantly different than what we've had in the market for a while now. What's different again, as Gary mentioned, is the type of schedule. So we're moving to much better local timings rather than a hub structure that has a lot of flights late in the day and very early in the morning. So it should be much better for the local market. But the overall flight schedule on that 165 to 170 is not a lot different than what we've had for quite a while in Atlanta now.","Gary C. Kelly","And makes it very consistent with where we are in Denver, where we are in Phoenix. That's quite a bit larger than where we are in Dallas and actually even Houston, which is an original city also. So that's a lot of flights, and I think it will have a much improved schedule here beginning in November.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On the -- connecting the network side, it seems like there is some operational hiccups associated with it maybe on the bag losses and maybe some customer unhappiness if you book through Southwest versus if you book through AirTran. Wondering if you could quantify what the impact from that has been? And have you been raising any AirTran fees as a result of operational issues?","Gary C. Kelly","I wouldn't accept any of that. I think that in terms of having an interim code-share or a network connection for the vast majority of our customers, what we offer works just fine. As per usual, when we have irregular operations, in other words, flight delays or cancellations which happen infrequently, then it is more challenging. But on the whole, it's worked out extremely well. So no, we're not losing any more bag -- I mean, it is an undetectable effect of the issues that we have, understanding that every day we have delays and cancellations and bag challenges. So there are a few more with this interim product, but nothing of anything that concerns us. And yes, there has been some media attention to that lately. But again, that is a very, very few number of customers that are affected.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- just a follow-up on the Atlanta question. What's the -- what should we see after this November implementation of the new schedule? Like, where should we see the -- how should we see the improvement in the earnings?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think Atlanta has opportunities to improve. It is not optimized today, nor is BWI or Milwaukee or Orlando, which are the 3 other major overlap points. So all of those markets, as we continue to optimize the schedule and transition flights out of the old AirTran approach into a new Southwest approach, we'll probably have some risk that in the short term, those markets will take a dip, especially if it's a new city pair that -- in other words, just because we're switching flights from AirTran to Southwest doesn't mean it's the same flight. It could be a brand-new city pair, and we could be discontinuing a city pair that AirTran had. So it may take a dip, and we see that as new developing market. But our expectation is that they're going to develop very quickly, and that's what we were referring to in the press release.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The -- just tell me about the RASM and fully appreciate the sort of economic baselines are pretty volatile here. So maybe coming at a -- if I think about the second half, you've got the up-gauging sort of drag that you referred to which I would think of largely in the run rate. You have the code-share benefits and some of the positives from the initiatives. As we look at 3% July, who knows where exactly domestic ATA or A4A will shake up? But is that relative performance kind of how we should think about the balance of the second half? Or is the bad guy -- does the bad guy of up-gauging sort of offset the good guys in OpEx and RASM? And just kind of help us think through the relatives to the industry because, obviously, the baseline's changing and in terms of the economy, it will probably change if not again, multiple times by end of the year.","Gary C. Kelly","We probably ought to let you just work with IR on that as time goes by here, too, because I think there are a couple of moving parts. But the seats are the big things that's different, and I don't think it's immaterial here. I mean, it's a point or 2 effect on RASM. So it -- and I'm talking about within Southwest RASM, so it is comparing, for example, second quarter '13 versus second quarter '12. But it also distorts somewhat the comparison between our RASM change compared to the industry. So there's a couple of thoughts there. Now I think what Investor Relations could help you with is how does that ongoing year-over-year seat density, to use that term, how does that play out over the next couple of years? And we can certainly do that. But you're going to continue to see an increasing mix of 800s. You've pretty much got the full up effect of converting to the Evolve seats. But remember now, we're just now going to start retiring 717s and replace those with 20 more seats in terms of 737s. So this is going to play out over a while. Having said all of that, what we're seeing so far in July is 3% unit revenue gains, and we feel pretty good about that. And the other thing to take into account, and Tammy made this point, is that, yes, there's a RASM effect. But just because the arithmetic shows that, doesn't mean it's a bad thing because there's also a CASM benefit, and we're very confident that we're seeing a margin expansion because of the up-gauging. And that's the important thing to note. So I just need to make sure you got them both working in tandem in the way you model. And the good news is we're seeing really, really strong RASM, especially considering that kind of a drag.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And -- but another way to come at it, the initiatives that are obviously very -- should be margin accretive in the second half, are they -- are the positives to revenue in terms of -- like things like code-share. Obviously, you've talked about the O&D revenue management. But are those really in the run rate by July? Or is there also sort of a positive phasing that's yet to come as we move through the year to balance the negative arithmetic of...","Gary C. Kelly","I think it's both. So I think there are -- you'll see an increasing mix of more seats per departure, which should continue to enhance the margin as time marches on between now and the end of 2015. And again, between now and then, the major contributor is probably -- again, I'm just thinking out loud with you, but it's probably going to be the 717 retirement in favor of replacing it with 737. So that's point number one. Point number two is that you have yet to see the real benefits of the network optimization and also the maturing of the transitioned AirTran markets into Southwest. So we've put a lot of chips on that initiative, if you will, and we're just now getting started with that in the second quarter. So we're looking for and expecting an uplift from that from second to third and then more again from third to fourth. We've been talking a little bit this afternoon about Atlanta as an example. So Atlanta is a visual out there that happens in November. And again, I think what I was alerting you to, that, initially, there might be a little hit there from Atlanta but it's all being done with the thought that you're going to have a much better revenue-producing route system in Atlanta once we made that change. So those are just sort of examples of things that we'll continue to roll out. Tammy, do you have some other color you want to add there?","Tammy Romo","Yes. The only thing I would add on the run rate for RASM is, as Gary mentioned, the impact of the increase in seats per trip probably had about a 1- to 2-point RASM impact here in the second quarter. It's probably closer to 2. And in the second half, I think that would soften a bit simply because we had some up-gauging in the second half of last year. So it should ease a bit as we go in the second half, but there will be still some impact.","Gary C. Kelly","And I can tell you understand all this very well. But just to make sure we're not confusing anybody else, as to the question from a business perspective of whether up-gauging the fleet is working and oh, yes, I mean, we've got more than ample evidence that, that is the fact. The -- as I mentioned, the 800s, we're filling those extra seats. And we're filling the 800s at a higher rate than our normal system average. So we can tell you exactly what revenue was generated on the 800s. And then the same is true for the 700 Evolve aircraft. My recollection is, Tammy, we've added -- you know, David, that we've added 6 seats per aircraft and I believe that we filled 3.6 seats out of those 6. And it's virtually -- the incremental cost of that is virtually nil.","Tammy Romo","Right.","Gary C. Kelly","So the business side of it, the profit side of it is all there, it's just how you measure some of these metrics on a per available seat mile basis. It can get a little distorted, which sounds like you understand perfectly.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Exactly, exactly. And just one real quick nit. The 64 300s on Evolve, that sounds like the same number. I just can't remember. I thought you had said the 300s are -- some 300s are going to Evolve. Is that more 300s? Or is that just a repeat of the numbers?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, our plans are unchanged. I think...","Tammy Romo","78.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, I know. And I think just when we shared that with you, I'm not sure. But there -- Tammy is reminding me. There are 78 300s that we consider to be eligible for the Evolve seating just based on the time that we intend to keep them before retirement. And we've retrofitted 14 of those with 64 to go.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tammy and Gary, I realized synergies are somewhat in the eye of beholder, I suppose, but you did cite a $90 million figure for the second quarter, as I recall. And just for kicks, if we take that out of your operating profit, then things seem to have gotten quite a bit worse year-on-year, I mean, like down 20%. And of course, fuel guy -- fuel was the good guy year-on-year. So you've got other airlines out there with no synergies that still achieved improvement, so doesn't it imply that the core operation at Southwest is, I don't know, rather ill? I mean, I'm sure you disagree with that characterization, but the second quarter numbers paint a very discouraging picture.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think that's a fair question and I -- but I think, really, your first statement is the most appropriate, which is it's really hard to think about these pieces in a disconnected way. I mean, the whole organism has to -- it takes everything for it all to hold together here, and I think that's a very fair assessment. There's definitely an impact on the revenue performance at Southwest and everybody else from the economy. So we're not out of line with everybody else. Relative to thinking about these baselines, Bob Jordan and I were talking about this earlier this morning. Baseline -- nothing ever stays the same. So whether you're comparing us to brand x or brand y, everybody is continuing to do things plus or minus to themselves in addition to what's going on with the water level. So I would agree that all that's hard to piece apart. We know that there are some penalties in our current route system that are being incurred because we're still suboptimized. It's more visible to us today, in other words, than it was last October for the second quarter where we are underperforming in certain markets. And also, we actually have a fairly large number of brand-new markets which I would put into the developing category, and we're expecting them to develop rapidly. So those, Jamie, are some of the offsets, if you will, to all the good guys that we've been listing. But it all falls into the same description of we need to continue to take this combined route network and optimize it. So the base business, if you think about same-store sales where we get all the noise out, our same-store performance looks quite good. So I would actually take it in reverse. If we didn't have all this noise, gosh, we would have really good results. But in any event, we're very confident that these new markets that we've established -- Bob, what is an example of a new city pair? Just so Jamie knows what we're talking about here.","Robert E. Jordan","Well, we've got a mix of markets that are new, again, as Gary mentioned before, coming from AirTran and then a mix of markets that are new to Southwest Airlines. A good example is adding -- routing this Houston-DCA route here.","Gary C. Kelly","Out of Flint, Michigan, we were flying to Atlanta. Now we're flying...","Robert E. Jordan","When you're flying to Atlanta, you're going to Baltimore.","Gary C. Kelly","We're now going to Baltimore. So that Flint to Baltimore is brand new to all of us. And that is a -- we have to treat it like a new market and we expect it to develop very rapidly.","Robert E. Jordan","We fully expect, particularly with this deal in the connecting network we've got behind Baltimore, that the Flint -- that Flint route will do very well because you've got so many additional places you can connect to, but it does. Again, it's a new market because folks in Flint have to learn that they can -- that that's the schedule they have to...","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, but -- I mean, guys, the airlines have new markets all the time and I just have to push back on the comment that you're in line because you're out of line. I mean, I guess, you have company with JetBlue here, Gary. But everybody else, even with your synergy figures, everyone else got better in the second quarter and you didn't. Well, I don't see how that's in line. But I mean, again, it's, I guess, it's subject to interpretation.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I've answered your question. So it's very -- it's a fair one. We have a lot of things going on that are good, and we have some things that are offsets, and we also have the economic drag. But that's the answer. And in fact, we have a lot more new markets under development right now than I think any of us would like. But we want to get this transition done obviously and get to a point with the route network that is productive. So if they don't perform, we'll simply continue to make those adjustments and eliminate the flights that don't perform in lieu of better market opportunities. And what that also ties directly into is that we need to be very mindful of our capacity plans for 2014, and we do have a more cautious outlook for 2014 based on current results.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom, and thank you all again for joining us today. And if you have any additional questions, of course, we will be available to take those calls this afternoon.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we'll will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communications, Strategic Outreach.","Linda B. Rutherford","Good afternoon, everyone. If you'll just take a moment to view the question for the team here and queue up. The operator will give you instructions to do, so we'll take your questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now begin with our first question from Terry Maxon with the Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxon","I got a couple of questions about the LaGuardia incident. I know you can't say what happened. First of all, is there -- have you learned anything in the 3 days since that has caused you to do any inspections or have any type of reaction with the rest of your fleet? And secondly, their plane looked certainly reparable. So the question simply, can that -- how soon will it take to get that airplane back into service?","Gary C. Kelly","Terry, great questions. I just can't talk about any of that at this point. So we're obviously very pleased and very thankful that there were no serious injuries. I was very proud of the response that our folks had in safely evacuating the aircraft. The first responders in New York did a fantastic job, as did the Southwest employees in New York. So I can speak about that. But anything about the situation or the incident, I just can't talk about. NTSB, obviously, is, as usual, leading this investigation. We're in full support of that. We should have a lot of information and data to get all the facts that make good judgments about whatever we need to do, if anything, to make changes going forward.","Terry Maxon","The second part of that question, any question about whether or not that hull can be put back into service?","Gary C. Kelly","I would put that in the same category. I think it's a bit premature for me to make that assessment. But obviously, by the NTSB's report that they're going to investigate, they'll do a full investigation. There's damage to the airplane and we're going to need to be thoughtful about that. Mike, is there anything you want to add?","Michael G. Van De Ven","Yes. We just have access to the airplane over the last day or so. So we'll have a group of people from Boeing come. They'll look at airplane, give us some alternatives, and then we'll decide where to go from there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Koenig with the Associated Press.","David Koenig","In the line items, fuel was down, you saved money there, labor was up almost as much. Maintenance was another line that was down. And I'm wondering how you were able to cut down out of maintenance. Is that from outsourcing? And also, are labor costs part of maintenance? Or is this just kind of hardware that's in that line item?","Gary C. Kelly","That's what's referred to as maintenance materials and repairs. So the Southwest employees are in the salaries, wages and benefits line. The repairs would include outsourced labor, if you will. So if we -- as we have done traditionally, we outsource our engine maintenance, so any labor cost that's embedded in that would be in that line item. Maintenance inherently will fluctuate. One activity that was completing during the second quarter is our Evolve seating retrofit. Some of those costs are capitalized. Some of them run through the expense line. But I would expect that spending to ease as we go forward. Last year was pretty high in terms of our maintenance spending because we were ramping up that activity. But in particular, Tammy, you want to speak to some of the other maintenance cost changes besides that in the second quarter?","Tammy Romo","Sure, I'll be happy to. Yes. And a part of it is, of course, we are retiring our Classic fleet as part of our fleet modernization efforts. And as a result of that, we are seeing fewer engine repair costs. Those are accounted on, as Gary said, on a time and materials basis. So a lot of that is just timing of when the engines fall in the quarter. So we had a little bit lighter spending this year versus last year. But I think those were the primary drivers.","David Koenig","And when one of your rivals mentioned yesterday, one thing they trying to do to cut costs was to reduce the number of spare engines because of the ease in the access to repairs and the quicker turnaround and that kind of thing. Are you doing anything like that? Are you able to go with a -- go a little lighter on spare engines because of the turnaround?","Michael G. Van De Ven","This is Mike. We -- all of our engines in our fleet are GE engines, and we have agreements with the GE on spare levels that are acquired. And those spare levels do take into account the engine turns, the availability and access. So we're very, very comfortable with the spare levels that we have to support our fleet. And I would -- I believe they're some of the most efficient in the industry.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","I'm interested in finding out how the transition of the route network in Atlanta is affecting your efforts to attract new customers and more business through the acquisition of the Atlanta market. Are you still going full steam ahead? Or is there -- are there challenges in attracting more business for Atlanta?","Gary C. Kelly","Kelly, I think it's premature. I think what has happened since we've acquired AirTran in '11 until now is we have seen a significant increase in nonstop traffic, and we've been very pleased with that. The change that you're referring to though is more material, and the schedule doesn't start flying until November.","Kelly Yamanouchi","I see. Okay. Any changes in the view of the potential, the long-term potential, for the Atlanta market since the AirTran deal was announced, whether due to macro factors or otherwise?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, absent macro factors, no. The -- actually, I've been very pleased with the Atlanta response up to this point. I think it's been terrific. And we just got to work our way through the transition to a different style of flight schedule. And obviously, we've put forth a meaningful marketing effort locally, and I would want that to continue. So I think we have a great opportunity there. I think we've been very warmly embraced by the community and just looking forward to the day where it's all fully integrated into Southwest Airlines. So that will -- we're right on track with that. It's going to take us until the end of next year, but very much looking forward to that, and I have very high hopes for the Atlanta market.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing or additional remarks.","Linda B. Rutherford","Thank you so much. As usual, if you all have any follow-up questions, you can reach our Communications Department, (214) 792-4847 or via swamedia.com.

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Director of Investor Relations.

Kelly","Thank you, Marcy, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter 2013 earnings call. We're off to a very solid start in 2013. Essentially, right on plan. We had record traffic and revenue performances in the quarter. Until March, at least, we had a very stable revenue environment dating back to last fall, and that was despite all the noise surrounding personal income tax increases and the whole federal sequestration.","We did hit a soft patch in March. That's continued on into April. I would attribute that to the above noise and along with the timing of the Easter and Passover holidays. So we are seeing booking strength return for May and June. And assuming that these May, June trends continue, they should be strong months.","We have wild swings in jet fuel prices already since the beginning of the year. Prices have dropped from our first quarter peak over $0.50 a gallon, and fortunately, this has roughly offset the revenue softness that we've been experiencing of late. And so assuming that these fuel cost trends also continue along with the May, June booking trends, we'll have a very strong second quarter.","There's much frustration, of course, with the FAA's implementation of sequestration. All that's in the news. And the Airlines for America, which is our trade association, is already in litigation over this. And the furloughs, of course, just started Sunday. So there's not a whole lot more to add at this early point, other than it just needs to end very quickly.","I want to thank the Southwest Airlines people for an excellent start to 2013. There are a number of initiatives that are contributing to the first quarter results. There are a number that are still under construction. Our top priority in terms of deliverables this year was connecting the separate route networks of Southwest and AirTran, and that was done, of course, it's done on time, done schedule, and it seems to be producing significant incremental bookings for future travel.","The network connectivity, of course, sets the stage for us to aggressively optimize the networks this year. We've already opened up 6 new Southwest cities as of April 14 -- 5, in fact, on April 14, as a part of our optimization efforts. And we announced that we will de-hub AirTran's Atlanta operation with what will end up being essentially the same number of daily departures just scheduled on a point-to-point basis, and that will happen in November. That will be a tremendous amount of work for our Atlanta AirTran ground operations employees, and I want to extend to them a special thanks for all of their very hard work and excellent results.","And with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Tammy Romo, our CFO.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our first quarter 2013 net income, excluding special items, was $53 million or $0.07 per diluted share. And that was ahead, of course, the First Call's consensus estimate of $0.02, and that was primarily due to our cost coming in better than we expected, which I'll cover here in just a minute. Our revenue -- and just a note on the profit, that was a significant improvement over first quarter 2012's $18 million net loss, which was driven by record profit in March.","Our revenue performance for the quarter was strong on relatively flat year-over-year available seat miles, and our operating revenues were a first quarter record of $4.1 billion, largely driven by record passenger revenues of $3.8 billion. On a unit basis, our passenger revenues grew 1.8% year-over-year. As Gary mentioned, our trends were steady through February, and our January and February PRASM were each up over 2%, and that was followed by a flat year-over-year March unit revenue performance.","Our unit revenue trends remain stable and on plan. But of course, March was negatively impacted by softer yielding traffic, weather and weakness in close-in bookings, which was more than offset -- which more than offset the benefit from Easter travel. Although a little softer than we expected, it's worth noting that our year-over-year March PRASM outperformed the industry on a capacity adjusted basis.","Despite an increased number of fees per trip, our first quarter load factor was relatively in line with first quarter last year, driven -- largely driven by more aggressive sales activity this year. Although we experienced yield pressure, our passenger revenue yield was also a first quarter record, increasing 2.1%. Our yields benefited from 3 targeted fare increases implemented in first quarter and, thus far, in April, we've implemented 3 more targeted and 1 systemwide fare increase.","While softer yields have continued into April, we are encouraged by the close-in booking trends in the recent weeks, which are back to running slightly above year ago level. That said, traffic and revenue trends, thus far, in April, coupled with difficult year-over-year comparisons from the timing of Easter, suggest our passenger unit revenues will be down year-over-year in the low to mid single-digit range. Bookings for May and June, however, are currently solid.","Overall, we are cautious about our April trends and uncertainties surrounding the potential impact on travel and demand from government sequestration and tax increases, but are certainly pleased with the improvement we've seen in the trends.","As Gary mentioned in his remarks, our strategic initiatives and other revenue products helped our first quarter results, and we've realized $70 million in net synergies from the AirTran acquisition. We're pleased with our progress in first quarter and excited about the potential for the remainder of the year. And with connecting capabilities now in place, we have significantly strengthened our ability to optimize the Southwest and AirTran network, and we're excited about the potential opportunities ahead. Our schedule is currently out through October, but we will be publishing our November schedule soon. And we continue to be very encouraged by the strong bookings from connecting the networks.","Business Select revenues were approximately $22 million, and we recognized another $20 million in incremental passenger revenues from our Rapid Rewards program. And Wright Amendment revenues were also strong, increasing 5% year-over-year to $64 million in first quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the revenue contribution from the incremental -800 and Evolve seating. And overall, our EBIT contribution from fleet modernization is on track with our forecasted $300 million EBIT contribution in 2013. So overall, very pleased with the first quarter benefit from our initiatives largely contributing to our record passenger revenue performance.","We also had year-over-year growth in freight and other revenues. Other revenues increased 2% year-over-year, largely due to higher charter and EarlyBird revenues. Our charter revenue benefited from increased demand from military and commercial charters for the Super Bowl. We increased our EarlyBird fee by $2.50 per segment in February, and EarlyBird revenues increased 17% year-over-year to $48 million. We also recognized 5% increase in certain another fees, contributing $69 million to other revenues, including $3 million from our A1 through A15 at-the-gate boarding sales.","We're also pleased with the 5.4% growth in our freight revenues, and we continue to expand our award-winning cargo service with integration of our AirTran network. We appreciate all the dedication and the great service provided by our outstanding cargo team. We currently expect second quarter freight and other revenues to increase from first quarter 2013.","Turning to fuel. Our first quarter 2013 economic fuel price per gallon, including fuel taxes, was $3.29 per gallon, which was right in line with our expectations. This was significantly below first quarter 2012's all-time high $3.44 per gallon driven by lower Brent crude prices and lower mark-to-market losses, only partially offset by higher crack spreads and jet differentials.","Our hedging premiums were $5 million versus $6 million in the prior year. During the first quarter, we significantly increased our hedge protection for 2013 to roughly 95% coverage for the remainder of the year. And for second quarter, approximately 75% of our positions are hedged directly in varying Gulf Coast jet prices, with the majority of our protection beginning at $3.10 per gallon. The remaining 25% of our hedge is in Brent, with the majority of our protection beginning at $135 a barrel. We use the combination of swaps and costless collars when layering on these additional positions. We do have some floor exposure which was a trade-off we were willing to take to not spend anymore on premiums and still locking in hedge jet prices below our 2013 plan that we previously communicated to you.","Our net premium cost for second quarter is still estimated to be approximately $12 million. In addition, as prices fall, we participate, as indicated, in our economic fuel price sensitivities we provided in this morning's release. Based on market prices as of April 22 and our second quarter hedge position, we currently expect our second quarter 2013 economic fuel price to be in the $3 to $3.05 per gallon range, which is well below second quarter 2012's $3.22 per gallon and below what we assumed for second quarter fuel in our 2013 plan.","For the second half of the year, just a quick update there, we also have 95% of our estimated fuel consumption hedged, with approximately 75% of our positions hedged directly to varying Gulf coast jet prices in 25% to Brent. Our total 2013 premium costs are still estimated to be approximately $60 million, and that's compared to $36 million last year.","We will continue to actively manage our hedging position to protect our 2013 plans from the impact of rising fuel costs, while protecting our balance sheet from downside risk. Beyond 2013, we currently have 60% of our 2014 estimated fuel consumption hedged, 30% to 35% of 2015 and 2016 and 50% of 2017 through a combination of WTI and Brent positions, with floors well below current market levels.","Excluding fuels, profit sharing and special items, our first quarter unit costs increased 2.8% year-over-year, and first quarter airport costs were -- came in better. That was a little -- that was better than our guidance, and that was driven primarily by airport costs coming in better-than-expected due to favorable settlements that were not anticipated. And while it's always difficult to predict timing and amount of such settlements, we expect airport unit costs to generally be under pressure from cost escalation. Operating costs also benefited from lower-than-anticipated advertising spend for first quarter.","As expected, investment in our fleet initiatives contributed about 1 point to our first quarter cost inflation. Maintenance included approximately $20 million for our Evolve retrofits.","Based on current cost trends, we expect second quarter unit cost, excluding fuels, special items and profit-sharing, to increase year-over-year in the 2% to 3% range, which is similar to our first quarter performance. We continue to track against our 2013 plan. That assumes a 1% year-over-year increase in our nonfuel unit cost, excluding profit-sharing and special items. On the nonoperating cost side, our net interest expense declined year-over-year from lower interest rates and debt levels. We expect second quarter 2013 net interest expense to be comparable to first quarter 2013.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended first quarter 2013 with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our first quarter 2013 cash flow from operations was a strong $983 million, with free cash flow of approximately $450 million.","Earlier this month, we increased our revolving credit facility from $800 million to $1 billion and extended the facility through April of 2018 under more favorable pricing terms. The $200 million increase enhances our liquidity and flexibility to deploy more capital back to our shareholders. During first quarter, we returned $150 million to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Our stock repurchases totaled $100 million in first quarter or approximately 9 million shares, and that brings our total repurchases to $725 million or approximately 82 million shares under our $1 billion authorization.","We made $164 million of debt payments during first quarter, and we have $149 million in debt and capital lease scheduled payments for the remainder of the year. Our $313 million of total debt payments this year includes $126 million of prepayments for AirTran aircraft backed secured loans that we made earlier in the year. Our leverage, including balance sheet aircraft leases, was approximately 40% as of March 31. And based on scheduled debt payments, it's expected to decline to the high 30% range by year end. Our 2013 CapEx forecast remains in the $1.2 billion range, and we continue to expect another year of healthy free cash flow.","Overall, I'm very pleased with our financial position as we remain investment-grade with strong liquidity, modest debt and a focus of preserving our financial strength and returning value to our shareholders.","And before I wrap up, I want to give you a quick recap of our 2013 fleet and capacity plan. For 2013, we have 18 firm orders for 737-800, and we recently leased 2 -700 aircraft. We had 2 -800 delivery scheduled for late 2013 that shifted to 2014. On the retirement side, we expect to transfer 16 717s to Delta, and combined with our classic retirement schedule, we continue to manage to a flat fleet.","We expect our 2013 ASM capacity to increase modestly in the 2% range year-over-year, which is the same as our previous guidance, due to increased seating capacity from our fleet modernization effort. For second quarter 2013, we expect capacity to increase in this 3% range year-over-year. And for third quarter 2013, we expect capacity to increase in the 1% range year-over-year.","So in conclusion, obviously, we're very pleased with our first quarter results and we are making progress on our financial goals. Although April revenue trends appear soft, May and June bookings are solid, thus far, and we are benefiting from lower fuel prices that roughly offset the revenue weakness we've seen. And we're, of course, also encouraged by the slight improvement in close-in bookings. We have significant revenue opportunities in front of us this year, supported by our strategic initiatives and new revenue stream. And assuming current revenue trends hold and based on our current cost outlook, the expected benefit from our strategic initiatives and the protection from our fuel hedges, we expect record second quarter earnings and we remain on track to achieve 15% ROIC this year. We also remain focused on aggressively managing our invested capital and, again, very excited about the opportunities ahead.","And with that overview, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question, and it comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just on Atlanta, as we look at Atlanta through the rest of this year, are you continuing to cut on a combined basis?","Gary C. Kelly","I think the flight activity -- I'm going to let Bob tune this up, Duane. So Bob, you can chime in here in a second. But essentially, the flight activity is relatively flat, as I recall, between the various schedules that we already have published and what we are anticipating publishing for November. The big change here in November is very straightforward. We're moving off of the hub-and-spoke. The current hub has an early-morning bank, and it has a late-evening bank. It is not timed well. In fact, it is timed poorly for local traffic needs. So this will be a significant change for our product offering to and from Atlanta when we move through this in November. And that's the substance of the change. We'll have -- it's all -- for the most part, the majority of the flights are still AirTran, and that will be the case in November. Remember that we still have, by that time, we'll still have 70-plus 717s and they are scheduled in and out of Atlanta. But this will set the stage, obviously, for the AirTran operation to fold into Southwest operation late next year. So Bob, anything you'd like to add?","Robert E. Jordan","Yes. Just real quick. Gary, you're exactly right. We have about 175 flights a day today, and the November schedule will be just slightly less than that, but that's really seasonality. So we'll continue to have in the 170, 175 kind of range. AirTran has banks at 8 and 10 a.m. and 8 and 10 p.m., and they have a significant number of flights after 9 p.m., which you know aren't really when our customers want them or need them, particularly our business passengers. They peak at about 30 flights or 30 aircraft on the ground during those peaks, and the new Southwest schedule in November will have a maximum of about 20 aircraft on the ground at any one time. So it just lets us put the flight smoothly across the day, really lined up in terms of when our customers want the flights.","Gary C. Kelly","And of course, the other thing we'll be focused on, Duane, is local traffic. So this is actually bringing more competition to the market, with more flights in the meat of the day, and with an objective and an expectation that we will be generating more local travelers than what AirTran has been doing.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on capital deployment. As you approach the end of this stock repurchase authorization, how should we be thinking about the capital returns going forward? And as you maybe think about growth beyond '14, how do we think about balancing growth versus continued capital deployment?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think, it's a little premature for us to give you a specific answer because we're not going to provide any new information on our share repurchase or dividend policy today. But directionally, we want to continue to have as our priority to hit our return on capital target and continue to enhance shareholder value through those 2 mechanisms, and also put the airline in a position where it can grow the fleet and pursue attractive expansion opportunities. So we want to balance -- I think, the takeaway, Duane, is we want to try to balance all of those. But clearly, the #1 priority has to be sustaining our profitability and at levels that meet our return on invested capital target.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Gary, a question on the challenges that our government is currently posing for Southwest. On one hand, you obviously have sequestration. Your competition intends to respond by pulling down 50 theaters, but that's not an option for you. Next, we have the budget proposal, $100 departure tax. It seems to me that the impact of higher segment fees and PFCs would also weigh a bit more heavily on your passenger base than, say, United's. And of course, yours is the only network where automotive substitution is a meaningful threat, not across the entire network, of course. Maybe these problems go away, but if they don't, how do we think about Southwest responding? And I'm thinking longer term here. Does this impact how you select markets? Does it drive you towards the 737-900? Does it force you to rethink certain ancillary fees? Any thoughts on that?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think if the world changes, Jamie, of course, we're going to have to continue to adjust. The good thing about Southwest is we are in a transformative, not just phase, but of mindset. So if those challenges become real, I feel like we've got the leadership team and the people at Southwest to respond. I think you bring up hypothetically all the kinds of questions that we would want to pursue. On the short-haul aspect of the question, though, we've already aggressively begun to rotate Southwest out of an all short-haul airline into a longer-haul airline. And there's -- you know everything that we've been doing, and you know everything that we have planned through 2015. I think the ancillary fee element of your question, we're going to continue to -- regardless of what happens, I think we're going to continue to evaluate whether we have the right mix and match of fares and fees, so that in and of itself, I think, is going to continue. Ron Ricks is here with us, and if we need to get in more specifics, he can certainly assist here. But basically, at this stage, you have a budget proposal from the administration, and there is nothing before Congress at this point. So we're a long way away from those taxes. And obviously, the AirTran -- or the Airlines for America and along with Southwest will definitely not be supportive of that kind of an increase on an industry that's already overtaxed. You didn't speak -- address directly to the FAA sequestration or maybe I missed it? But is there any comment that you were looking for there, Jamie?","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Not in particular. I mean, that kind of folds into the short-haul question. Actually, the follow-up that I would ask, and please don't let me stop you from adding more on ATC. But on the short-haul issue, ASMs per gallon rose to a record level in the quarter, declining short-haul activity, which you identified the drivers, 737-8s obviously drive the metric higher as does the Evolve interior, as will the exit of 717s later this year. So I know you normally don't guide on this metric, but perhaps you could give a little color. I mean, can you get above 75 ASMs per gallon by year end, for example? I can get you there, but you have to make a lot of assumptions on stage length and stuff like that. It's kind of a wishy-washy analysis. I'd rather fall back on yours in this case.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, let me just say this, I -- we can -- you know what is happening in our current results. I think we can explain those very well. In addition to all of the mechanical changes that are taking place with the fleet, in other words, bigger gauge, retiring smaller gauge, adding seats to the 700s, Mike Van De Ven and his ops team also has fuel conservation initiatives on top of that. So I feel very good about the momentum we've got. What I don't have in my mind, Tammy, is a prediction about where we might be a year from now.","Tammy Romo","And just one thing, Jamie. I just want to make sure, we're -- the first quarter 2012 fuel consumption PRASM, that actually declined 3% year-over-year, and we would expect that trend, for all the reasons Gary just pointed out to you, to continue. We haven't given a prediction for that, though.","Gary C. Kelly","So we've got more available seat miles per gallon. So I think we're all square. So I think yes, it should continue to improve. I just don't -- I don't have a ready forecast in my mind...","Tammy Romo","Yes, we haven't provided one yet. But it will...","Gary C. Kelly","But we can come back with one.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jim Parker with Raymond James.","James D. Parker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Gary, Tammy just reiterated, I think, your goal and your expectation on the reaching ROIC of 15% by the end of this year. And I think you said in the previous call, when you get to 15% ROIC, that you're going to reconsider capacity growth. I'm curious if your capacity discipline is independent of the industry? Is your capacity discipline largely based on benefits to Southwest or benefits to the industry, which, in turn, impacts Southwest as the largest carrier?","Gary C. Kelly","Jim, I'm not sure I understand the nuance in your question, so I'll give an answer and you can redirect. But clearly, we're going -- our duty is to manage Southwest Airlines, and I almost feel silly saying that to you. I know you know that. We'll be looking at opportunities that we think will be successful within the industry. And it, well, said a different way, we'll want to factor in the competitive environment of us adding flights in new markets. So we have our sights on some expansion opportunities where we believe that we will be successful competitively and we'll be able to expand and hit our return on capital. So I'm not sure exactly where your thought is headed beyond that.","James D. Parker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, my thought is, are you inclined, perhaps, to increase capacity that certainly enhance the Southwest profitability in a near-term basis, but perhaps causes the industry some detriment, or causes the industry to say, \"Hey, we need to start expanding capacity.\" And this capacity discipline becomes unraveled a bit for the industry?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think that all of that is factored into -- yes, I would just say that our expansion thoughts would have a long-term view, not a short-term view.","James D. Parker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That benefits the industry as well?","Gary C. Kelly","I think our duty here is going to be solely Southwest Airlines because in the end, that has to come back to either a positive or a negative effect on us for us to care. In other words, we've been a disruptive force for 5 decades, and because we had a competitive advantage to bring to the marketplace, whether that was good or bad for our competitors. So I don't see us changing that mindset.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen Securities.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Gary, I just wanted to ask you a question about something you actually said with respect to ancillaries. You've been really opposed to some of the fees that some of your other airlines, I guess, peers, charged. But I noticed the change in your ads to kind of focus on more soft ads, rather than the harder hitting Bags Fly Free ads. So is that kind of a way of starting to move towards other fees? Or is that like too much that I'm reading into it?","Gary C. Kelly","I think it's reading too much into it. And of course, there has been a lot of speculation. The nice thing about our current campaign, which has been out since March, is that it -- people noticed. It's created a lot of discussion and mostly fans of our new ad campaign, but of course, there's always going to be those that don't care for it. But I think we just have a challenge at Southwest because there's so much to sell. And a lot has changed at Southwest Airlines since 2006, and we really did want to have a fresh approach and create re-awareness, if you will, and perhaps, retrial from those who are thinking of us the way we were 10 years ago, we just have a whole different customer experience. So rather than focusing on one feature, like Bags Fly Free or our All-New Rapid Rewards program, we now have an array of things that we want to message to our customers. So this is more anthemic. I've read that this is unique for Southwest. It is not. We've done anthem campaigns before, and I would just point you to our Freedom campaign in the 1990s. We're not changing the essence of Southwest. We still are low fare, we still have Bags Fly Free, there's just a lot more to Southwest Airlines than not charging for bags. So that's where we're headed with the campaign. And as usual, this is more art than science, and the campaign will -- it will go somewhere. So it will either resonate with our customers and drive the kind of reaction and benefit that we want. And if not, then we'll obviously evolve the campaign.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I just want to follow that up with one unrelated question with respect to employee productivity. You're flying more aircraft with fewer people. And I just wonder, is there a room for additional productivity improvements, or is that starting to peak?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, ma'am. So we are flying more airplanes with fewer employees is...","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","That's a better way to say it.","Gary C. Kelly","There was a slight improvement in productivity, if you will, there. I think there's going to be a little bit of messiness in some of those metrics over the next couple of years, simply because there are a lot of flights at AirTran where the work is contracted out and the headcount are not in that statistic. And when we move, at least, some of the work in the Southwest Airlines, it may change the headcount. I think that your fundamental question is, are there -- forgetting some of this arithmetic, are there opportunities to improve? And the answer is, absolutely yes. And we already, of course, have very good -- harkening back to Jamie Baker's earlier question, we not only have opportunities to improve the available seat miles per gallon, but we have the same kind of opportunities apply for available seat miles per person. So we'll not only look for improvements with our current initiatives, but we'll be looking for new initiatives where we can improve our productivity going forward, and immediate objective that we added for our 2013 plan that we shared with you all last December, so in other words, this is not new -- breaking news, but it's just to remind you, as we do feel like we've got opportunities to improve our productivity within our corporate overhead, and that is something that we are working strenuously on here kind of behind the scenes, if you will, in 2013. There are opportunities to centralize and consolidate, and I think significantly improve some of our overhead functions. And I'm very pleased with that, and I want our headquarters folks to be leading this effort for the rest of the company.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2. Gary, I just wanted to follow up on Helane's line of questioning. It sounds like you're pretty sort of familiar that people are sort of trying very hard to read between the lines of everything that you say and Southwest does, and to see if there are any cues for fee initiatives that are going to surprise us, whether it's bag fees or not, and I was hoping that you could just sort of address the issue, I guess, kind of directly. As we look at the next couple of years, is Southwest an organization that's positioning itself for future where fees and other ancillary revenues, and they might not be bag fees, but they are potentially big, play a major role in driving revenue? Or is that just not, is that whole line of questioning, just going down the wrong path?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, it is and it isn't. There is no -- I'll try to be consistent with what I said before. And if I'm not, you catch me, John. But there's no intent here to change the positioning of Southwest Airlines brand with this ad campaign. Our brand includes Bags Fly Free. Period. Now what we are busy doing in Southwest Airlines is to create capabilities, so that in the future we can make tactical decisions much easier than what it takes us today. And that includes -- the easiest example there would be our reservation system technology, which we will replace and adding the capabilities to be international. What I have said, and I'll repeat, is that our brand is not built around not charging for a bag. That's not who we are. We're a low-fare airline with -- that highly values customer service. And so that is the primary filter that we'll want to have. There was a time where Southwest was very proud of the fact that we never had an advanced purchase fare. And of course, over 3 decades, things change, and now, customers don't care about that. So we'll -- I don't want us to be pinned down into perpetuity on what we might or might not do, and I want us to be sure that we have the capabilities to make those kinds of choices in the future. But beyond that, no. There is no change that is imminent with this ad campaign.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Gary, just to follow-up, it's not just the ad campaign. I mean, we saw the recent hire from Spirit, so there is a lot of cues that I think I hear about, at least, that people try to pick up on. So just forgetting about bag fees for a second, though, when you kind of think about the opportunity in front of Southwest over the next few years, do you see non-passenger revenue playing a much more meaningful role in some capacity over the next few years than it does today in the revenue profile?","Gary C. Kelly","John, today? No. So talking about 2013, no. We think that we have the best combination of features and fares, only then -- the only element to that is, you know and we know that there are things we are building that we want to be able to do. And again, I'll use international capabilities as the example there. I wish we could do international now, in other words. So I would certainly supplement what we're currently doing by saying, yes, we want that. The -- where the world is 3 years from now, we don't know. I mean, for all we know, customers will say, 3 years from now, we want you to separate out bag fees. And if that's the way the world goes and that's what customers want, we need to be in a position where we can react to that. But that's not where we are today. All the research that we have shows that we would negatively impact our revenues by close to $1 billion a year through the defection of current customers if we charge for bags, which is about as direct as I can be. I'm not willing to sit here and tell you that, that will be the case 3 years from now or 5 years from now. And if customer attitudes change, well then, we just need to be in a position where we change, too. By extension, I don't think that ancillary revenues in today's environment are the answer to hitting our earnings target. I think the answer is, we must optimize our route network. Period. That is the #1 objective, and that's why that's the #1 deliverable for 2013. We have very significant opportunities to drive unit revenue improvement from where we are by eliminating underperforming routes and redeploying that aircraft and managing our capacity very, very carefully. That is the #1 opportunity that will dwarf any ancillary fee idea.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's really helpful. And if I could just ask for clarification on guidance. This might be better for Tammy. But you reiterated the 15% ROIC target goal this year. Revenue has clearly been softer than the 4% to 5% that you were talking about at the Investor Day, for no fault of your own. But is the right way to think about it, as we model this, that the lower fuel that we're now forecasting through the end of the year should trade-off one-for-one with revenue and we should adjust down that RASM, that 45% RASM target that you had spoken to? Is that the right framework, or do you think it's going to net even more positive? Can you just help me kind of think about that?","Tammy Romo","At this point, of course, we don't know what fuel's going to do. We're clearly trying to maximize our revenue. But clearly, a lot of that depends on the economy and factors that are outside of our control. But certainly, to the extent we can control it, we're still focused on maximizing revenue. But certainly, at the end of the day, our goal is the 15% ROIC and at least, thus far, the revenue weakness has been roughly offset by the decline in fuel prices.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So we should try our best to kind of make that adjustment but hit 15% ROIC by the end of the year, that's how you would think about it?","Tammy Romo","The 15% is our goal.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question for Gary. I mean, just going to your point about the network reallocation being the big lever, I'm curious. Now that you have a little bit of time with codeshare under your belt, obviously for a very limited time, but at least a little bit, I'm curious how you're seeing sort of the international connectivity develop relative to domestic, and how does that play into schedule sort of November and beyond? Is that another -- is that codeshare working in a way that lets you sort of use your international as a bigger lever to reallocate the network? Or just curious how that's trending?","Gary C. Kelly","Not really. And -- so let me just give you -- and Tammy may want to share with you more specifics. I know she shared some information about the incremental bookings from connections. But the -- we're seeing a very strong response, first of all, to the new itineraries that we've published, because we have been able to connect the network. So that's argument number one. And again, I'll defer to Tammy to share with you maybe how much that is. What we are not comfortable with yet is concluding how many of those bookings are incremental, simply because we would admit that an itinerary, a codeshare itinerary could simply be now occupying a seat that got squeezed out and got displaced, that we would've carried anyway on other itineraries. So I'm sure you're familiar with that concept. When you move now over into international, the international routes, as a whole, are performing very, very well. They were -- are 100% AirTran. As you know, Southwest flies no international routes. The total capacity deployed in international as a percentage of our total network, I want to say, is 1%. It is a very, very small component of our capacity. So at least in the near-term, even if we were to double the flying in that market, it's still going to be relatively insignificant. Now AirTran has been, under -- our management, has been reallocating some of its flying. It has allocated some of its flying to new international markets, and I think we'll continue to do that. And there's a lot of tactical reasons for that. One is, we're pursuing route authorities, and as they become available, we apply for them. If you get them, you got to fly them. So you have those kinds of things. But for the most part, there aren't a lot of changes that you should expect within AirTran international. It will be 2014, of course, before Southwest is in that position. And it's no secret, so I'll just repeat it. Houston Hobby is a very good international expansion opportunity. It will not happen during AirTran's flying, so it will be 2015 at the earliest that those facilities will be ready. But clearly, that will be -- that's an expansion opportunity that Southwest will be prepared for and will have our eye on. So that's, at least, one example of how we're thinking about international in the near-term.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's incredibly helpful. I would be curious if there's anything Tammy can add, just in terms of more tactically how to think about sort of codeshare run rates, and then how to think about it over the bulk? We start to see the benefit in May, just to help kind of guide our RASM thinking.","Gary C. Kelly","Before Tammy answers, let me just make one clarification. The -- and just to be sure, you know what I was trying to say there. The international flying is relatively small, but it does connect into the codeshare. So those itineraries are out there for sale, and that's included in the total numbers that Tammy's going to talk about here.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, right.","Tammy Romo","Yes. And as I mentioned, of course, the bookings continue to be strong and from connecting itineraries and our ability to sell each airline, the AirTran and Southwest flights, our daily bookings are averaging over $3 million in revenue per day. But as Gary pointed out, that is not all incremental. And I guess the best guidance we can give you really goes back to the synergies that we've provided, all of that is baked into our synergy number. And of course, the fact that they are so strong gives us further confidence that we'll achieve our synergy target of $400 million.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob McAdoo with Imperial Capital.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Kind of wanted to go back and just a very quick little question, kind of back to the earlier question-and-answer portion about -- where you're talking about de-hubbing Atlanta. And I understand the concept and obviously, it makes a lot of sense what you're doing in terms of spreading it out and having shorter peaks, or not so tall peaks or however you want to say it. But the other piece of that, that I wanted to kind of understand is, as we start to watch the last few changes, it becomes clearer that there are a number of cities that, as AirTran disappears, say, from a Rochester or a Flint or whatever, the service from Rochester or Flint into Atlanta also disappears. And I wonder, is that a part of the de-hubbing process as well in terms of reducing the number of cities that you use to actually serve Atlanta, because like Buffalo and other places that are up there by Rochester? Should we think that those are also going to not have service and that...","Gary C. Kelly","Yes. Bob, I think you are -- I think you were thinking about it correctly. And I'll queue up Bob Jordan, too, because he'll remember better where we've been and where we are and where we're headed here. But it's a conversion process taking place over 36 months, first of all. There were cities, Bob McAdoo, that were eliminated from the AirTran route network last year. And so that -- you could say that, that impaired their hub performance to some degree already. Now some of those -- back to the previous question on international, some of that flying that was feeding the Atlanta hub was redeployed to international route opportunities, and we think wisely so. But the -- but if you just looked at the performance in the Atlanta hub, we're still not satisfied with it and, obviously, believe that the solution is to make this conversion to the point-to-point system. Now one little factoid that I've enjoyed as an example is, if you remember all the Wright Amendment deals and how that compromise was reached, Southwest can't fly at the DFW without giving up things at Love Fields. So AirTran had, when we bought them, nonstop DFW to Atlanta service. We're carrying more customers between Dallas and Atlanta now without nonstop service. So that's the power of the Southwest network. And so I am very comfortable that -- and I'm pretty sure your Rochester example is accurate, that we -- yes, we will not necessarily have nonstop service to Atlanta, but we're plugged in now to San Antonio and of course, the Dallas example and often Texas just to think about close to home here, and that is driving a significant amount of traffic, whether it's on native Southwest or whether it's on the Southwest-AirTran combo. And so I think there's every reason to believe that our strategies going to work and work well.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Well, I was just trying to think about that as compared to something like Denver where it seems like you're kind of hooking up every possible city into Denver. But here, there's a lot of cities where there's been this history and it's being unhooked, and I was just trying to get that in my head as to where this was all headed.","Gary C. Kelly","Again, your question is -- all questions here are very good. But the thing that's a bit different about Denver as compared to what you're seeing with the AirTran Atlanta is that Denver doesn't really have a Rochester. So Rochester and Flint and Grand Rapids, and a number of -- Des Moines, a number of these cities are very small by typical Southwest standards, and you don't have a good example in Chicago or Denver or Phoenix, et cetera, so we're trying to make these new cities work. And just because they're not flying to AirTran doesn't mean that -- I'm sorry, to Atlanta, doesn't mean that they won't work within the Southwest system. But Atlanta could be a large \"hub-like operation\" like Chicago Midway for us someday. But right now, I think we're very happy with evolving at this point-to-point network system first, and then obviously, with the hope and the desire that we can grow it from there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Gary, just 2 questions here. On the Atlanta, as you go from the hub to the point-to-point, you'd probably very likely will need less gates. My sense is that there'll be less planes on the ground. Is there an opportunity there to maybe reduce the footprint with the infrastructure? I know you just indicated that you aren't still satisfied with Atlanta, and I think some of that may have to do with costs and the fact that you're carrying a decent amount of overhead there. Is there anything on that front that could bring down the cost fees?","Gary C. Kelly","Mike, I don't think that that's a major item. The footprint, just the physical footprint of a 717 is going to be different than a 737. So in terms of just square footage, we could probably -- we would probably have less gates anyway, if you're following my math there. But no, I don't -- first of all, Atlanta, as it exists today, is a very cost-effective airport. It's gigantic. It gets congested at times, but its costs are low. So I would certainly not complain to you about the cost \"burden\" of the Atlanta Airport per se. We're always looking for opportunities to optimize our fixed costs like that, so we'll be looking at that. But that is not anything that I have in my mind. And Mike is here with me. I don't think that we're going to be giving up or talking to the airport about giving up any space at all.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just my second, the -- I believe you said it's -- what is it? $3 million per day from the connecting itineraries with AirTran?","Tammy Romo","Mike, that's correct.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is that -- okay, Tammy, is that $3 million, is that a gross number or would that be net of...","Tammy Romo","That is correct, Mike, and that was the point we're making. Of course, not all of that is incremental and again, but we've factored all of that into our synergy target or guidance of $400 million.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. When I meant net, though, I know you were saying that maybe some of those passengers were ones that maybe had previously flown over the system. But I'm thinking more about like forgone service fees or bag fees. Is that in that number, or would that take that number down some? And I guess, that'll be very hard to estimate with that...","Tammy Romo","Yes, that's not included in that. That's not included in our number.","Gary C. Kelly","But Mike, I would quickly add that Southwest has consistently outperformed AirTran on a unit revenue basis. So I don't think that's -- you asked a good question that we'll want to think through, but I don't think that's a material piece of the analysis here. I think the bigger question is -- I think the bigger question of the $3 million incremental, well, our folks obviously are doing work to determine how much is incremental, so we have some read on that. I just am not comfortable that there's enough history for us to draw meaningful conclusions yet. But you can give it a substantial haircut. It's still a gigantic number, so...","Tammy Romo","Yes. And again, it's still early on, but my guess is it'd probably 1\/3, maybe of that, but we want to get a little more history under our belt here.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, I'd be happy with that.","Tammy Romo","Yes. That's all factored into the synergy target.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You can't -- that's a very big number. I won't be disappointed.","Operator","We'll go next to Glenn Engel with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, did you give out a number on what's the close-in bookings were percentage this year versus a year ago?","Tammy Romo","No, not yet, Glenn, but I'm happy to provide that. Our mix of close-in passengers for first quarter was 21%.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And last year was?","Tammy Romo","Last year was the same, exactly. And that's up a little bit from fourth quarter.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And how much at-risk is left in the ancillary fees of AirTran?","Gary C. Kelly","Say it one more time?","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","AirTran is charging fees. Those will eventually go. How much at-risk is that left?","Gary C. Kelly","Oh, how much is left, okay.","Tammy Romo","Just what? In terms of what the AirTran? Those were in the $30 million range, Glenn.","Gary C. Kelly","In the quarter.","Tammy Romo","That's correct.","Gary C. Kelly","And Glenn, I think I know where you're headed with your question. That's initially why we bought AirTran. I think they were generating about $300 million a year in fees that -- fees that we don't charge. And so yes, we were trying to figure out how we transition from AirTran to Southwest and keep the profit wheels on. And it's just we haven't had a problem with it. So the -- I think, again, we've been pretty pleased with the revenue conversion process here.","Tammy Romo","Yes. And I think we've been managing that really well. So just the other components, what I gave you was just the bag fees in total. It was closer to $50 million. But just keep in mind, too, Glenn, that we're continuing to increase other fees on our side. And again, I'll just point you back to what I reported on earlier. We recognized a 5% increase in various fees, which contributed to $69 million in other revenues, and that includes -- that included some of our incremental ancillary revenue opportunities like the A1 through A15 premium boarding. So I think we're managing through that pretty well.","Tammy Romo","And I think, Tammy that -- Glenn, if this is helpful, I think the AirTran footprint, if you will, has shrunk about 25% since we initially acquired them. So all the 717s are still flying, of course, in AirTran, and there's 88 of those. And we've moved 18 or 19 airplanes, or will have moved I guess that many airplanes by the end of this year. So we'll have 30-some-odd 737s that are left to be converted next year, if that gives you a little bit of help there.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And finally, why isn't the revenue synergies translating into RASM outperformance relative to the industry? And when would you expect that to happen?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I'll start giving you my view and Tammy may have a little bit different view. The opportunity to improve revenues from just fundamental market share gains or fare increases is really optimizing the network. So our network is sub-optimized, and I do think that, that is a drag. What is offsetting that drag is the list of initiatives benefits that Tammy walked through. One reason that she has been saying that we're still determined to hit our return target for this year is because the step-up in the unit revenue trend improvement is really second half-loaded. So the real power this year in driving the revenues is going to come from connecting the networks, and then secondly, optimizing the networks. It looks like -- I believe all these numbers are very solid, so it looks like we're seeing very solid gains from the -800s; we're seeing very solid gains from the Evolve seating; they are literally outperforming the 137-seater version by the actual number of additional seats. So In other words, there -- on average, there are 6 more passengers on the Evolve flights and there are 38 more passengers on the -800 flights. So they look very, very strong. And that is absolutely a revenue contribution. That is just irrefutable. The other piece that is very easy to monitor is the frequent flyer program. We know exactly what we're getting from our partnerships there, and the cash flow has been very, very strong. So it just suggests that there is perhaps some under -- some other underlying weakness that is offsetting. But in any event, our trends until March were real stable. Month in, month out, we were sort of up 15% [ph]. While we've got all these things going on within AirTran to get it converted, actually, Glenn, I'm pretty pleased with that.","Tammy Romo","And I don't have a lot to add to that, Glenn. The only other thing I would just point out again or emphasize is just the connection of the networks through codeshare here in April. We, of course, just operate -- just started operating all of that this month. And as I mentioned earlier, we've realized $70 million in net synergies from the AirTran acquisition, and only about maybe 50% of that related to revenues. So just to emphasize the point, there's still, we believe, significant revenue synergies to come.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Unfortunately, I think I know what your answer's going to be. But we recently had a consolidation of 2 carriers you compete with materially in the Southern U.S. They filed to plan a reorganization. You talked about adjusting capacity for Southwest. As you're looking at the competitive landscape now that the major consolidations are done, how do you see this changing the way you're thinking about your capacity over the next year? So have you already planned for this? Or now that the plan of reorganization has been filed, do you view the competitive landscape a little differently in Phoenix, Dallas and some of the East Coast cities you operate out of?","Gary C. Kelly","I'm not sure why you said unfortunately, but you'll have to tell me.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Fair point.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, sure. I mean, the major inputs into our thinking about the future, there's 3 of them. There's the economy, there are fuel prices and there's our competition. So it is an input. It is not the input. Whatever we do, we need to achieve our objectives. We want to take care of our people, we want to take care of our customers, we want to take care of our shareholders. We've got to hit our profitability target. Period. And if there are competitive changes in the industry that help facilitate that and also lead to growth opportunities, I think that's fantastic. But there's a lot said and written about consolidation. Bankruptcy is a separate issue, although they do get connected in a sense. I think the great discipline here on the industry has been fuel, it's taken the industry years to be adjusted to $3.29 jet fuel per gallon. The industry is healthier today because it has gotten itself adjusted, and bankruptcy has been one of the techniques to get its cost down. But what that all leads to in the next generation, I don't know. It is clearly a mature industry compared to where it's been the last 25 years. And you have a lot of coverage of a variety of players, you've got low-cost players, you've got so-called full-service players and again, you've got very, very high fuel prices. So -- but we're going to be disciplined, we're going to manage our capacity, we're going to be making whatever adjustments we need to make to hit our return on invested capital target.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom, and thank you all, again, for joining us today. We are available this afternoon if you have any additional questions, if we weren't able to get to all of them today. So again, thanks for joining us, and have a great day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to introduce first, Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communications and Strategic Outreach.","Linda B. Rutherford","Hello there. How's everybody doing? Tom, if you would go ahead and give our folks some instructions to be able to queue up for questions, we'll get started.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sheryl Jean with Dallas Morning News.","Sheryl Jean","I just have a couple of questions about the FAA sequestration issues. Up until today, I believe, Southwest has been saying flights have not been significantly affected. Is that still true as of today?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes. The vast majority of our flights are operating on time. What has happened to us since Sunday, it does not live up to the dire predictions that the FAA made last week, which would grind the entire system to a halt, so we certainly haven't seen that. Rather than put out a dire warning to all of our customers, we already have a customer feature in place where we notify them of their flight, specifically if it's going to be delayed. We do see that our on-time performance is impacted since Sunday, but so far, we've been able to manage it. I think the problem, Sheryl, that I've tried to describe today is that -- and just to be very clear, we were not advised of the FAA as to what their plans were going to be until last week. So there's 5 days before the Sunday imposition of the furloughs. At that point in time, we were not advised as to exactly what they were going to do. So we couldn't tell you what city, what time of day or what flights. And of course, being from Dallas, you know the story of the American Airlines airplanes that ended up at Love Field. I can assure you, when those flights launched from their origin, they had no idea they would be redirected to Dallas Love Field. So it is that kind of uncertainty that we face, one could say, almost on every flight. The number of flights that are being impacted today are relatively few, but there are definitely some impacts that we're seeing. And they have predicted that they're going to make it worse, and I think that's our primary concern is that, that not be allowed to happen.","Sheryl Jean","So do you feel -- and this has come up with some other airline officials, do you feel that FAA still today is not communicating enough information or quick enough information on the staffing issues?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, they are hard-working people, okay. So they -- I think given the mandate they've been given, I do think that they are trying hard, and our ops folks tell me that they are getting better. But I think the -- so it's not for a lack of effort, but no, we don't have enough information to plan at all. And the other thing that you should know is that we cannot coordinate with our competitors. It's against the law. So there is no way for us to easily make adjustments to schedule flight activity because we can't talk each other, number one; number two, we also don't know what the airspace capacity is going to be. We actually start the morning with very strong on-time performance, again, as an illustration. And then throughout the day, what we've experienced, especially Tuesday and yesterday, and what we seemed to be experiencing today is, as the day evolves, we get surprises during the day, we're told to hold on the ground or we're told to have an alternative routing, and that's a real challenge for an airline. Again, having said all that, the vast majority of our flights are still operating on time, just as we have them scheduled.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles","During the call, you mentioned an example of the fact that Southwest is now carrying more passengers to Atlanta from Dallas than they did when you first bought AirTran, when AirTran was running nonstop service out of DFW airport. I was wondering, are there any other cities where you're seeing that occurring out of the Dallas market, and is that factoring into your plan when you think about what sort of flights you're actually going to be running out of Love Field when the Wright Amendment restrictions lift in 2014?","Gary C. Kelly","Well -- so Bob Jordan, I'll ask you to answer the first part of the question. Andrea, if you don't mind, I'll answer your second question first. That is absolutely how we plan. So in other words, we look -- we have flights, we see where people are flying. Most people fly on us nonstop. But if we have a significant number of customers that are flying to a destination on a one-stop basis, that becomes an obvious opportunity for us to put in a nonstop flight. I remember vividly back in the early 1990s, we were the number -- as an example, we were the #1 carrier between Houston and Las Vegas, and we had no nonstop flights in that market. So we do today, and so absolutely, we'll be looking at Love Field from that kind of an opportunity perspective. We know exactly where people are flying on us today beyond the Wright Amendment restrictions, and all of those will be very good ideas for nonstop flights. And Bob, do you want to talk about Atlanta, please, sir?","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, absolutely. And just to add and just to talk about the strength of both the Southwest network and the Southwest brand in terms of what we're seeing with AirTran. Maybe just a couple of things to add to that Dallas example. In just 30 days here, the first 30 days of having full up co-chair, actually less than 30 days, southwest.com has actually become the largest distribution point for AirTran flights. So we're actually distributing more AirTran through southwest.com than through airtran.com, which is just an incredible thing. It just points to the strength of the brand and the website as well. And then on the network side, I think the best example there is the strength that we've seen in the growth of local traffic in Atlanta, and that's even before we really optimize the Atlanta network, which you'll see here in November. So we picked up somewhere in the -- in terms of the comparison of connecting traffic to local traffic in Atlanta, we picked up about 8 points of local traffic. So about 8 fewer points of connection and 8 more points of local without a dramatic change in the network there. So as Gary pointed out earlier, I'm just really optimistic about continuing to win local traffic by just simply offering flights at the time that our folks in Atlanta want them, which is really the whole point behind the November schedule change.","Gary C. Kelly","Right, right. And another way to say that, in other words is, the schedule that we have today and the one that we have had with AirTran is not very good. It's not as competitive as it needs to be to attract local traffic. So the fact that we've been able to drive that increase in local traffic, I agree with Bob's points 100%. So that's very encouraging.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andy Compart with Aviation Week.","Andrew Compart","I just wanted to follow up on the Atlanta stuff. You started touching on it there. Can you tell me, first of all, what the percentage of connecting traffic is in Atlanta for AirTran and I guess combined right now? And then, what do you expect that will be after you make this change in November?","Gary C. Kelly","Bob, I vaguely recall what it is. Do you know off the top of your head?","Robert E. Jordan","Well, I think I can give you, yes, a couple of points of reference. AirTran, at the time that we acquired AirTran, it was roughly 60% connect in Atlanta, which is pretty typical for a hub. Sometimes even more. A city with a lot of connections for us, so for example, Chicago, is going to be much closer to 40%. And I think we said today in Atlanta that, that 60% has moved down to about 52%, 53%, so we've already seen a big increase in locals. But you'll continue to see that shift towards local traffic. And I would expect that it will ultimately end up closer, again, to a Baltimore, Chicago kind, which would be 40% or just south of 40%.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, that's -- I would agree with all of that.","Andrew Compart","And again, along those lines, in places where you have a lot of operations, you do make some allowances for connections even though it's not typically a hub-and-spoke. Is what Atlanta will be like? Will it be like a Midway that will make some allowances in the schedule to foster some connections?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, absolutely. In other words, the way to think about it is we're simply making it Southwest. And no 2 cities are exactly alike, but they all trend towards having a dominant component of local or nonstop traffic, they have some relatively small component of true traffic, and then there's generally a 20% to 30% mix of connecting traffic. That's the way Chicago looks, that's the way Houston looks. All -- said a different way, Bob, to my recollection, we don't have a city that looks like a hub-and-spoke.","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, we do not. I think the best way to think of it maybe, particularly when you're AirTran and you have one dominant hub, is you start with the need to connect and you build the schedule around that. And that's why you end up with a lot of flights after 9 p.m., before 7 a.m. And a Southwest style city, you start with the local traffic and the demands of the customers and when they want the flights, and to the greatest extent, the connections then kind of fall out of that. So it's just the reverse. One example I was looking at are -- just as an easy one, our Atlanta to Kansas City operation. In today's schedule, AirTran serves that at 10 a.m., 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. So not very good timings, particularly for our business customers. And in November schedule, those flights will be timed at 8 a.m., noon and 6 p.m. So there's a much, much better flight time in terms of folks in Atlanta that want an early-morning flight and then a reasonable time to connect back out. So you -- and you'll see those kinds of improvements all across the board in our markets in Atlanta.","Gary C. Kelly","That's great. That's a great example.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Ghim-Lay Yeo with FLIGHT GLOBAL.","Ghim-Lay Yeo","Just a little quick question about the No Show fee that you mentioned in your earnings release today. Do you have more details on that? And how is that expected to help you with the revenue?","Gary C. Kelly","There is really not much -- it's really simple and that's helpful. There's really not a lot of details. It's not a fee. It is -- you forfeit your fare if you don't cancel it. And there are -- we're not -- we don't have change fees. I see that several of our competitors have moved to a $200 change fee, and at Southwest, it's 0. So all we need our customers to do is to cancel their reservation, which puts us in the position of finding a replacement customer for that seat. And that is -- that's what every other airline does, and it's really time for us to do that as well. So that change will go into effect with bookings after May 10, I believe, for flights in September. But it's not a fee.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing or additional remarks.","Linda B. Rutherford","Thank you all.

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com, in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call to discuss our first quarter results. Joining me on the call is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President, Finance, and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and President of AirTran Airways; and Mike Van De Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. We will begin with opening remarks from Gary, followed by Tammy providing a review of our results and our current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy's remarks.","Please be advised that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please refer to this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","I'll turn the call now over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary C. Kelly","Thank you, Marcy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results, $126 million, were excellent. I'm very pleased, very happy for all of our Southwest people. They worked very hard to get us to this point, and I am delighted to see them rewarded for their efforts. Demand was very strong and very steady and resilient, you might say, considering the extreme weather and all the flight cancellations. And I'm very grateful to our customers for hanging in there with us as well. The bad weather definitely cost us but we still managed to stay on plan. Fuel prices continued to be stable with some help from our fuel hedging program, and currently, we expect fuel price stability to continue with modest hedging protection, at least for 2014, at about 20% coverage.","I'm very pleased with the progress on our 5 strategic initiatives, starting at the top: All-new Rapid Rewards is, of course, up and running and very smoothly. And in my opinion, and where our folks are delivering the best frequent flyer plan in the business, and it is exceeding our expectations.","Next is the 737-800. We're now up to 54 units in the fleet. It's delivering high load factors, very strong revenues and, of course, lower unit cost. So very pleased with that initiative.","Third is the rest of our fleet modernization. It's very much on track. The Evolve seating retrofits were completed last year, and those aircraft are also delivering the added revenues at a lower unit cost. The AirTran's 717 retirements are underway, gradually being replaced by 737s in Southwest. This, too, significantly boost revenue per trip for the, really, the same if not lower cost per trip. And then finally, we're continuing the accelerated retirement of the 737 Classics. All combined, these fleet activities are providing a boost to our fuel efficiency gains as well.","We completed -- next, we completed the first phase of our reservation system replacement with the on-time launch of our new international reservation system that was done on January 27. And even more satisfactory, it's performed flawlessly.","And finally, the last year of the AirTran integration is right on track. Aircraft remain transitioned out of AirTran and effectively into Southwest. Flight crews and dispatchers are transferring into Southwest at the same rate. Published flights are rapidly coming down in the AirTran brand and coming up in Southwest Airlines. The commercial aspect of the integration will be done by year end, and we'll have some wind-down activities that will spill into 2015 but all those should be invisible to customers.","We'll launch more flights from LaGuardia, Reagan and Love Field as planned. LaGuardia and Reagan slots, of course, resulting from the AA divestitures, and then Love Field expansion is due to the repeal of the Wright Amendment. And then next year, we'll launch more international flights and out of our new international terminal that's under construction at Houston Hobby.","So a lot of things going on in 2014 and they're clicking right along. We're working on our 2015 plans. We have a desire to grow modestly next year based on the results that we expect for 2014. We are on track to achieve our return on invested capital target for 2014 and of course, as usual, that assumes no change in economic fuel price or cost trends. But assuming we keep the fleet flat next year, our roughly 695 aircraft, given the large number of out-of-service airplanes that are coming back into service in 2015, in addition to the up-gauging effect of trading out 717s for 737s, as well as adding 737-800s, that would increase our seat capacity next year in the 2% to 3% range. But until we report otherwise, you should continue to assume a flat fleet for 2015, and that will allow for meaningful growth.","Our balance sheet is in superb shape. It should strengthen this year as we continue to produce strong cash flow and pay down debt. At the same time, we've continued to reward our shareholders with share repurchases and increased dividends. And our liquidity is exceptionally strong, supporting these balance sheet moves.","So in short, a great quarter and especially considering the weather, the integration drags that continue in the high percentage of developing markets.","So I'm very, very pleased to be here with you all this morning. And now I want to turn it over to Tammy Romo, our CFO.","Tammy Romo","All right. Thank you, Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'll begin with a quick summary of our overall results, and then I'll jump to the revenue and cost trends. As Gary said, our first quarter net income, excluding special items, was a record $126 million, which was $0.18 per diluted share, and that exceeded First Call consensus of $0.16. This was a significant improvement over our first quarter last year's $53 million, which was driven by improved performance each month of the quarter, especially March, which was a record profit performance.","Our first quarter GAAP net income was also a record $152 million. Operating income, excluding special items, also set a first quarter record of $242 million, which was a stellar performance, especially considering the estimated $50 million reduction resulting from the winter storms.","Our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items, for the 12 months ended first quarter was 14.2%, which, on an aftertax basis, was 8.9%, which exceeded our average cost of capital. These are superb results, and I'm grateful to our Southwest and AirTran warriors for their outstanding efforts, especially during this year's challenging weather.","We are close to our 15% pretax ROIC goal and we plan to hit it this year, although, of course, it's always difficult to predict the economy and fuel prices. But we will continue to exert every effort to hit it.","Our record first quarter operating revenues increased 2% year-over-year to $4.2 billion on a 1% decrease year-over-year in ASMs. Solid load factors across all haulings and healthy contributions from our revenue products contributed to our very strong first quarter revenues. In addition, our strategic initiatives remain on track and continue to contribute significantly to our profitability. Both operating and passenger unit revenues were record first quarter performances.","Our first quarter business travel trends were also strong with double-digit increases in corporate sales. Our passenger unit revenues grew 3.5% year-over-year, which included about 1 point benefit from significant winter storm cancellations that reduced revenues by about $45 million but on 1.7% fewer ASMs. January and February PRASM were each up over 5%, followed by a 1% increase year-over-year in March PRASM. This was an outstanding performance, especially considering 2-point year-over-year unit revenue headwind from increased seat gauge and stage length, which, of course, has a greater unit cost benefit. In addition, nearly 20% of our first quarter ASMs were under development.","Our revenue strength has continued, thus far, into April, of course, benefiting from the Easter and Passover holiday shift. And based on current bookings and revenue trends thus far, we expect April PRASM to be up year-over-year in the 6% to 7% range. Keep in mind, April also benefits from easier year-over-year comps compared to May and June. Bookings for May and June are also currently solid. And just one other consideration, the July 4 holiday that falls on a Friday versus Thursday last year, which could impact June travels.","Let's turn to freight and other revenues. And our freight revenues grew 2.6% year-over-year as we continued to expand our award-winning cargo service with the integration of our AirTran network, and other revenues declined year-over-year, as expected, largely due to the decrease in ancillary AirTran fees from a reduction in AirTran capacity, all as planned. Ancillary revenues on Southwest, however, did experience strength, which was driven by EarlyBird and our A1 through A15 select boarding and as well as pet fees.","We currently expect second quarter other revenues to also decline year-over-year, likely at a greater rate than experienced in first quarter, again, due to the ongoing conversion of the AirTran network.","I'll turn to fuel now. Our first quarter 2014 economic fuel price per gallon, including fuel taxes, was $3.08 per gallon, which was in line with our expectations, and this was 6% below first quarter last year's $3.29 per gallon. And that was largely driven by a favorable swing in jet juice [ph]. We also had a $0.06 hedging gain for the quarter and Brent also declined year-over-year, but that was partially offset by an increase in crack spread. Our first quarter results also benefited from better fuel efficiency as a result of our fleet modernization and other fuel conservation efforts. Our first quarter fuel burn improved by about 1% year-over-year and that also reduced our fuel cost by roughly $15 million.","In our ongoing commitment to the environment, we recently operated our first flight utilizing our Boeing 737-800 equipped with Scimitar Winglets, and we are expecting annual fuel savings of approximately 5% to 5.5% per aircraft.","Our hedging premiums, including below the line and other expenses, were $17 million at first quarter and we are currently expecting a similar amount in the second quarter.","Our second quarter fuel consumption is -- we've got a modest hedge in place of about 15%, and that's varying crude oil positions. And based on our market prices, and this is as of April 21, and our current hedge position, our current second quarter 2014 economic fuel price is forecasted to be comparable to second quarter last year's $3.06 per gallon.","Excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, our first quarter unit cost increased about 3.5% year-over-year, and approximately 3 points of that year-over-year unit increase related to winter storms during the first quarter. This better-than-expected cost performance was primarily due to favorable airport settlements that were not anticipated. And our operating cost also benefited from lower advertising and technology spend for the quarter that have been reallocated to later in the year. So based on current cost trends, we expect second quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase year-over-year in the 2% to 3% range. And for the full-year 2014, we are also expecting a 2% to 3% year-over-year increase in our unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended first quarter 2014 with $3.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, which included $10 million in collateral held from third parties. We had very healthy free cash flow for the first quarter with $712 million, which supported our ability to return $371 million to our shareholders through repurchasing of $315 million of stock and distributing $56 million in dividends. The repurchase of shares included a $200 million accelerated stock repurchase program that was executed on February 24, at which time we received 7 million shares representing 75% of what we anticipated receiving under the program. The program will be completed by May 9, and at which time, if needed, we'll settle in either cash or shares.","We have $20 million remaining under our $1.5 billion repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete this quarter. Since the initial buyback authorization in August 2011, and including our quarterly dividend payments, we've returned a meaningful $1.6 billion to our shareholders, which demonstrates our long-term standing commitment to return value to our shareholders.","We made $46 million of debt payments during the first quarter. And as a reminder, we have approximately $500 million in debt in capital lease scheduled payments for the remainder of the year. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, was 38% as of March 31.","Our 2014 capital spending forecast is approximately $1.8 billion and that does include the cost of the DCA slots. And about $1 billion to $1.1 billion of our total CapEx relates to firm aircraft spend. With this manageable level of capital spend, our cash flow outlook remains strong. And we also remain steadfast in our commitment to manage invested capital, which we've reduced by $1.1 billion since 2012. Our balance sheet is investment-grade and it is always a priority for us to keep that strong.","Before I close, I will spend just a few minutes on our fleet. As you saw in the press release, we've provided the detail in the text of the press release. But to recap, our full-year 2014 fleet plans, we have 33 firm orders for -800s from Boeing and plan to add at least 14 preowned -700s. We removed 22 717s from service in 2013 and the remaining 66 717s will be removed from service by the end of the year, even though there will be some transitioning to Delta in 2015. As of the end of the first quarter, we have transitioned 24 717s to Delta. In addition, thus far, we have transitioned 21 of the 52 AirTran -700s to Southwest, which leaves 31 -700 aircraft remaining that we plan to transition before the end of this year.","And as Gary mentioned, we have significant amount of activity we are managing this year as we wind down the AirTran brand and phase out the AirTran 717 fleet. And at a high level, we've been managing to a relatively flat fleet through the end of 2015, give or take a few aircraft, with a baseline of roughly 695 aircraft, which was our combined fleet at the time of the AirTran acquisition.","Our flight schedule is currently published through October 31 of this year, and we will hold through our plan to maintain flat year-over-year ASMs for 2014. We haven't set our fleet -- our capacity plans for 2015. So while it's premature to give an ASM forecast for 2015, year-over-year growth in seats will be 2% to 3%. And this, of course, will have significant unit cost benefit as we anticipated and, of course, we've got exciting growth opportunities ahead such as Love Field and Houston Hobby international flying in 2015.","Our commercial team has done an excellent job to-date of optimizing our network, and our operations team is doing a superb job managing a significant amount of conversion activity.","In summary, we have not set our 2015 plans but we have options to flex capacity up or down, as needed. And our Classic retirement plan was built to provide flexibility and we can also augment our fleet needs through the preowned market.","As we manage the integration work and removal of the 717s, we will augment the firm orders and preowned aircraft, and we may augment that beyond what we had disclosed in our press release. But again, all with the intention to manage to a flat fleet of 695 aircraft. All of this has been contemplated in our CapEx guidance of $1.8 billion for 2014, and our 2015 CapEx is expected to fall below 2014, with a flat fleet of 695 aircraft in mind. We have very exciting network opportunities, and we will manage with a continued focus on achieving and sustaining adequate returns on capital.","So in closing, we had a very strong first quarter 2014 performance and second quarter trends support continued momentum. Our strategic plan is coming together very nicely, and we're recognizing substantial benefits from our initiatives and investments. We continue to have a disciplined growth strategy with flat year-over-year ASM capacity in 2014 and at least 2% to 3% seat growth in 2015. We expect healthy free cash flows this year with manageable CapEx and debt obligations in 2014 and '15, and we have an investment-grade balance sheet. We continue to return significant value to our shareholders through share repurchases, dividends and healthy earnings and our 15% ROIC goal remains unchanged. We are close to the goal and as I said earlier, we will continue to exert ourselves to hit that.","And so with that, Tom, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Tammy, I think you talked about most of the AirTran -- or I think Gary had mentioned, by year end, that the commercial side will be -- will have been wound down. What's the carrying cost? Like, I can go onto the website, and there's an AirTran website, and I can call up and presumably, I'm speaking with an AirTran res employee even though they're a Southwest employee. What's that additional carrying cost that essentially goes away? Is it $30 million, $40 million a year? What's the number, how do we think about that?","Tammy Romo","Just to make sure I'm tracking your question, Mike. You're asking what kind of inefficiencies do we have as we wind down the AirTran brand?","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, the cost of just supporting a separate brand. I don't know if there's still any billboards left, but the signage -- I mean, there's -- obviously, to maintain it, there's got to be some cost associated with it that presumably would go away.","Tammy Romo","Yes, no. There's -- we -- I agree with you. We certainly -- there are some inefficiencies as we maintain 2 brands, and just the fact that we -- just from a scheduling perspective and a crewing perspective and especially, given that we don't have a stable -- we've been managing our schedule through this integration. I agree with you, there will be -- should be some opportunities for improvement next year. We haven't -- we'll start to work on our plan here for 2015 very soon, but I would anticipate that there would be some efficiencies that we'll be able to gain next year. We haven't put a figure to it yet, but, yes, we'll certainly work to wring out any efficiencies that we can. And of course, our unit cost will also benefit from the up-gauging in our fleet modernization efforts as well.","Gary C. Kelly","And, Mike, the only thing that I would add to that really perfect answer is that most of the obvious stuff is gone. So in other words, the way you were describing it, I don't think there are any material inefficiencies there by having a dual brand because our marketing folks are managing to one marketing budget. So you might say that the AirTran brand -- in other words, it's possible that the AirTran brand could be a bit under-supported, but in any event, I think there are definitely inefficiencies in the scheduling of 2 separate fleets that Tammy was referring to. And those, I think, we've at least described qualitatively but I don't think we have a number to that yet. But most of the obvious stuff is gone. We don't have 2 headquarters, we don't have 2 -- we don't have anything like 2 headquarters, departments operating, that's all consolidated into Southwest. So it's really the inefficiency of having 2 operating companies, I think, is where the big opportunity's here.","Tammy Romo","Mike, I'll give you just one example of an inefficiency, it's just as we're going through the transition with the implementation of a new reservation system as an example. Right now, we are maintaining 3 reservation systems and, of course, with the goal to ultimately get to one. So we do have some of those inefficiencies that we'll continue to work through. So it's those types of ideas that we'll need to -- or opportunities that we'll need to continue to work as we plan for 2015 and even into 2016.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just my second question, you talked about the higher CapEx number due to the purchase of the slots. Have you called out what that number is, what you paid for the slots? And then sort of along those lines, I know that you've -- you're interested, obviously, in the Dallas Love Field gates. Are there other American U.S. Airways gates around their system that you'd be interested in or is it just Love Field?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I'll let Tammy speak to the slots. I believe that's confidential, so we have not disclosed that. But the Love Field gates are obviously -- there's only 2 of them, so it's a rather modest opportunity there. But in any event, at this point, we don't have any other interest.","Tammy Romo","Mike, and the slots, the slots are confidential and we have not disclosed that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on the seat growth in 2015. I know it's still very early stages but I was wondering, how much of that might be domestic versus international?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, international, Savi, is so small. It's only 1% of our total capacity right now. The international opportunity that I highlighted that you're aware of out of Houston Hobby is fourth quarter. So it's not going to have a material capacity impact on 2015. If I'm thinking out loud, I think the vast majority is going to be domestic and probably oriented towards -- what we've already announced is our plans to expand the Dallas Love Field, so all of that will be domestic. So it'll be heavily weighted towards domestic.","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, I would agree. It's really Dallas, and it's really the investment in the DCA slot flying and the LaGuardia slot flying that carries it into 2015. And as Gary said, our international business is a very small percent of the total already. So even Houston on that, for part of the year, it's a small percent of a small percent. So it's really the domestic.","Gary C. Kelly","Now we -- and let me just repeat, again, that we're only published through October. So these are committed plans that Bob and I are sharing with you. That's just our -- assuming that the fleet is flat and assuming you see that kind of seat growth, that is what I would assume the split would be with those markets. But we could decide, just to be fair to your question, we could decide, between now and whenever we publish the second half schedule, that we want to put more capacity next year internationally. But that -- to me, that's what is assumed with that flat fleet.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then just on the national flights that you're switching from AirTran to Southwest, I know AirTran has some ancillary like baggage fees and other fees. Are you able to capture that through higher fares on these international flights? Or is maybe introducing bag fees on just international something you would consider?","Gary C. Kelly","I think the answer to your first question is yes. You just look at the continued unit revenue growth. And that includes bringing down the AirTran brand and bringing those flights up at Southwest. And the other, there is no thought to confusing the brand by offering bag fees on certain flights like international. No.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. Great. And just if I may squeeze one last one related to this, just -- so 1% of ASMs today, how much and how fast could that increase, do you think, over the next few years, international?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, again, I think it's premature. First of all, we're -- we want to grow but we're cautious. We -- the first priority here is to hit and sustain our return on capital. So I think that's really premature, but if -- I think it's going to continue to be a relatively modest component of the Southwest route system for the near future, for over the next several years.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Glenn Engel with Bank of America.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions on labor, Gary, Tammy. One is when I looked at the departures, they were down 5.9% in the quarter yet headcount was down only 1.4%? So why aren't we seeing -- it seems like your productivity, at least on the departure basis, got worse. And then, two, can you go over the profit-sharing calculation and how we should do that going forward, and whether current integration charges are now starting to flow through the profit-sharing line?","Tammy Romo","Yes. Glenn, I think on just your question on trips relative to headcount, we obviously had a lot of inefficiency just due to -- I'll attribute that largely to the weather. And on the profit sharing, again, our profit sharing was $29 million for the quarter and that was reduced by $6 million related to acquisition and integration costs, half of which were incurred in first quarter '14, and the other half related to integration costs incurred from April 2011 through December 23, which was in accordance with our profit sharing plan. And so the integration costs that deferral period -- for that deferral period totaled about $385 million, and that will result, and this is probably what you need, Glenn, and that will result in $58 million of lower profit sharing expense to be recorded January '14 through December 2018, and $3 million of which lowered our first quarter '14 profit sharing expense.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And additional integration cost, did those now impact profit sharing? Are those also...","Tammy Romo","Those just flow right through, like you normally would. So that was our -- we're past our cutoff period. So yes, that would just flow through the profit sharing calculation as normal.","Gary C. Kelly","Glenn, on your headcount productivity question, the other thing -- and of course, I know you know all this, but you can't just use trips as the only proxy for the headcount. So the available seat miles are probably a better proxy for flight crews. And then the trips are also getting -- some of them are getting more flight attendants per trip as an example. So there's a -- while, yes, the trips are down, and it does provide some relief for some workgroups, it is certainly not all.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","So Tammy, about a year ago, you said you guys are going to tighten some flexibility around some of your most restricted fares, and you said it was going to be done later in 2013. I'm kind of curious what you did, what you found out and if it was successful or not and if there's anything you can do going forward on that.","Tammy Romo","Yes. Hunter, what we did recently is we did tighten restrictions on our Wanna Get Away fares, and that's just essentially -- it's just a no-show. I would consider that really more of a no-show penalty, and essentially, if you don't call and cancel your flight, those funds would be forfeited.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. You're -- specifically for the No Show policy?","Tammy Romo","That's right. That's exactly what I was referring to.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And can we talk about sort of the relationship between advertising expense and distribution strategy. You guys spend about $200-plus million a year on advertising, which is a lot. And I understand that because you need people to go to southwest.com to buy your tickets. But have you thought about that in the context of maybe putting some more of your inventory on online travel agencies? That would give you more exposure that way and maybe alleviate some of the expense on the advertising side that you would have to get in people's minds to go to southwest.com. If they just go to Expedia and see your fare there, maybe you could spend a little bit less on advertising while sort of also tweaking the distribution strategy a little bit. Any thoughts on the relationship between those 2?","Tammy Romo","Well, Hunter, I guess I'll comment and then see if Gary or Bob have anything to add. But in terms of -- usually, the online, as you know, those are usually customers looking for discount fares, and we have no issue with that on southwest.com. We drive a lot of customers to southwest.com because they know that they can rely on us for low fares. And just another, I think, interesting fact, too, is that once we started distributing AirTran fares on southwest.com, we quickly became their largest distribution channel. So we're always looking at advertising and always looking for ways to spend those dollars more efficiently, and we'll obviously continue to do that going forward. But at this point, we don't have any major changes contemplated for our distribution strategy.","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, Hunter. This is Bob. I'll just add a couple of more things. Obviously, AirTran uses the OTAs, and to Tammy's point, we've seen no issue converting AirTran market flights to -- and customers to southwest.com. In fact, those markets are converting and maturing at a rate that's better than a typical new market for Southwest, so I really believe in our distribution strategy. The other thing really on the advertising, when you comp us to others, you've got to think about total distribution costs. So what's -- what you've got to add back are they're paying for GDS fees and bookings, and there are all kinds of costs that you have to look at in total as distribution, in addition to just advertising. And every time we look at that across all of our competitors, we are in the lowest, whether you look at that on a per-passenger basis or a per-revenue-generated basis. So I'm very comfortable with where our costs are, if you look at total distribution costs, which would include advertising. But as Tammy said, we're always watching our advertising costs. I mean, as an example only, we're managing the combined AirTran and Southwest brand basically at the same level of advertising cost that was Southwest only prior, so we're constantly looking for efficiencies there.","Tammy Romo","Yes. And we certainly have realized that, to Bob's point, which all that's been factored into the synergy numbers that we provided for AirTran.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary and Tammy, definitely appreciate the additional color on seat count growth next year. Of course, some of that is sort of onetime in nature. I'm curious if the team is willing to speak to a long-term ASM growth rate. If we envision a world where you're hitting your 15% ROIC target, what would be like a steady-state Southwest growth rate?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think it's premature to say. I think that's really not so much a strategic question as it is tactical. This is a very tactical business, and especially when it comes to growth and growth opportunities, I think, number one, is you have to have a strong balance sheet. Number two, you have to have confidence that your earnings will provide adequate returns, and then you have to be confident that you know how to manage growth. So we've been a growth company for most of our history, and I do feel like the company has a lot of institutional knowledge about how to identify new markets and about how long it takes to develop them and about how much should be exposed at any given point in time.","The other factor, of course, over a longer period of time that is key to your question is what are fuel prices going to be; and then, secondly, what our overall costs going to be because that will mean everything about generating more passengers and traffic and share for Southwest Airlines. So under the assumption that we continue to be if not the low cost producer or darn near close to it and maintain our low fare brand and fuel prices remain stable over the next decade, I think we have significant opportunities to grow the fleet from here.","I wouldn't say that that's 10% per annum, I think that, that was for this industry and for our company otherwise. So something in the low-single digits makes sense in terms of a planning horizon. But you are right to point out, John, that here, in the meantime, when you go from 2012 to '13 to '14 to '15, there's a lot of noise from year-to-year. And so once we get clear of 2015, that's something we'll be focused on, and we'll want to manage our growth very carefully and again, with an eye towards keeping the balance sheet strong and hitting our return on capital.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That is very thorough. And the good part about the noise, as you mentioned, Gary, in your prepared remarks is that it's going to improve the cost structure. When we think about all of the moving parts in 2015 and we think about sort of the seat utilization kind of popping back on the up-gauging from the -800 and the change in mix there, as well as perhaps even going back to Mike's question earlier on some of these AirTran expenses going away, I mean, it seems natural to think that we should see a deceleration meaningfully in the CASM x fuel growth, perhaps even a flat to down trend given all these numbers. I'm not sure if I've got the moving parts right. Maybe I'm missing some risks outside of labor. If you could just help me kind of think through that directionally, that would be helpful.","Gary C. Kelly","Well -- and Tammy, you chime in, too. John, you've been very thorough as well in your analysis. That is all intuitive. We have the same view that you do. We have not finalized our plan yet, and therefore, we're just not ready to provide any guidance. But if you think about the swap from the 717 to the 737, just to repeat what I said in my remarks, the costs are essentially the same. They may even be lower to operate the same number of airplanes, yet you're getting 26 more seats on every single departure. So when we talk about growth for Southwest next year, I'm not going to argue to you that it's free because it is true that we can choose to have fewer airplanes if we don't believe that we can generate that much traffic. But you're right, with this -- the growth we're talking about in the near term should come at a very modest cost relative to a normal view of a fully allocated unit of growth. So that certainly factors in somewhat to our thinking, but the bottom line is we need to be comfortable that we can generate traffic to absorb the increase in seats that we are planning for next year. So if we end up growing seats 2.5% next year, then we need to be comfortable that we'll grow our traffic by 2.5%. If we don't, then I don't think that we should be pursuing it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joe DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I guess my understanding, the part of the reason you're keeping capacity flat this year is to facilitate ROIC improvement. So does that imply simply that growing capacity is a negative for ROIC?","Gary C. Kelly","No, but I think it's just common sense that tells you that if your base business is not achieving your return target, why would you increase the base? I think it's just that simple. As a practical matter, the other thing that we keep reminding you and everyone about is that there's just a lot of work going on. So the aircraft movements out of Southwest, AirTran and into Southwest are going to be in record numbers. And then for Mike Van De Ven and our operating departments, that creates record numbers of training events for employees, so it's a lot of activity to manage. If you then said, \"Now I want to grow by x number of aircraft on top of that,\" I just think that that is unwise on its face. So for several reasons, we want to maintain relatively flat capacity in 2014, but the main reason is we haven't hit our 15% target yet. So I think we need to do that first and then make a judgment about whether that's sustainable with growth.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Yes, that's helpful. On the flexibility you have in terms of capacity for 2015, should I think about the driver there in terms of up or down, is that really going to be a function of the demand and pricing trends that you're seeing? Or should I think of it more as you guys using that as a means of managing kind of CASM growth?","Tammy Romo","I think it's demand. Yes, clearly, what we're trying to do is optimize the network to match customer demand, and I think our commercial team is doing a great job with the network and -- as evidenced by our first quarter results.","Gary C. Kelly","And again, that's what I was trying to say earlier, which is if we're going to increase seats, we need to be comfortable that we will also increase customers. It helps mitigate the risk to know that the growth is going to come online at a very attractive cost, but that's not the reason to grow. The reason to grow is because we believe we can increase the traffic and the revenues and then it would, again, come hopefully at a very attractive cost of debt service.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tammy, can I just ask you with regard to some cost items, can you provide a little more color on the maintenance side? I think you had mentioned that there was a little bit of delay or deferral in Q1. Should we assume that that gets pushed into Q2? And if you could quantify that to some extent, I would appreciate it.","Tammy Romo","Yes. Our maintenance costs that we did have, that came out a little bit lower than expected for first quarter just due to shifting. But all of that has been incorporated into the guidance that we gave you, so it's not -- I don't -- it's not material.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a minor point but I'm curious as to what drove the 5% increase in other OpEx.","Tammy Romo","Oh, part of that is weather. If you look at our increase, the 3.5% CASM increase, unit cost increase, excluding profit sharing and special items, really, most of that was attributable to weather for the quarter. And we also had some shifting in our technology spend, but -- so some of that will get shifted out throughout the rest of the year. But again, that's been incorporated into our 2% to 3% increase for the full year in that guidance.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Gary, can you remind me -- we've been talking a lot about the 15% return target. Can you remind me why it's 15%? I mean it's something that I can -- I just remember as long as I've been around. I mean -- and I suspect it came in the '90s when 15% probably meant something much bigger than it does today. And what I mean by that is 15% now as a return target, not dissimilar from your other large competitors, and frankly, it's lower than really the growth-oriented carriers. So when you start thinking about growth and return targets, shouldn't that target really be much higher?","Gary C. Kelly","I don't have a problem in debating where the target should be. And as -- I think it also depends on how fast one grows. So if we don't grow, I think that the target probably should go up. If we do grow -- the main thing is are we creating shareholder value or not. And so it's a matter of art as to how much of a premium over our weighted average cost of capital we need to be earning. You look at -- of course, you're an expert at this. You look at broader indices or broader performance across industries, which we do, and feel like the 15% is an adequate return. But that's something that we obviously would continue to consider and talk with our major shareholders about. And so the other thing, and you know the industry well, that I would remind you is that there are very few -- there are no airlines who have hit a 15% return on invested capital over this cycle except for Southwest Airlines. And that is what we did in the '70s. That's what we did in the '80s, and that's what we did in the '90s. So that history alone would tell you that it is not -- it's not a layup to hit that. But in any event, Tammy already said that that's our target and the target has not changed. Does that mean that it will forever be 15%? No. I don't think -- I wouldn't say it that way, but certainly, for 2014, we work very hard for a decade to get to this point and are not going to be ashamed to turn in that kind of performance, if that's the way it turns out.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. No, that's helpful. It just helps to kind of put the -- frame the debate around the fleet growth. That's very helpful. The other question I actually intended to ask was, can you just help us think a little bit about aircraft utilization and maybe even broader asset utilization kind of going forward? I mean, historically, you've run kind of sweat the assets. It's a little more tactical business now in terms of keeping schedules in the meat of the day and the meat of the year, so to speak. I mean, should -- when we're thinking about aircraft utilization over time, should we be assuming that you don't go back to where maybe Southwest ran 5, 6, 7 years ago?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, David, you -- again, you know us well, and you know this business very well. The utilization, just as a quick refresher, has varied a little bit since we bought AirTran. So AirTran, as a unit, has never been, I would say, efficiently scheduled. So we've had a little bit of slop in there. And then, of course, we've had a lot of aircraft out of service in 2013 and now in 2014, going through various conversions, either of all the seats or now converting airplanes out to Delta or converting them into Southwest, all the things that you know about. So at least we can say that we are underutilized right now and that the utilization will improve once we get clear of this integration work in 2015 and, especially, 2016. So that, we can agree to.","As to will the airline schedule the way that it did before 2008 or '09 where we had a lot of early morning flights, a lot of late evening flights, I don't think so. And again, I think we just only have to be open to the fact that things might change. But unless the demand reappears at that time of the day and it is efficient to schedule an airplane on a marginal cost basis, I don't see that that flying will come back. But you've got $100 crude oil, $110 crude oil today compared to a time where it was $10 to $20 a barrel, which made it more viable to operate flights on the shoulders with less than 50% load factors, and that's just not the case today. So as long as that case remains, then absolutely, you'll see the flight schedule in the meat of the day. And Bob, we're probably at the highest percentage ever. Aren't we about 88%, 89%, 90% scheduled between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.?","Robert E. Jordan","We are. We -- for 5 years now, we've cut those early and late flights really just based on demand. I mean, it's a flight-by-flight, market-by-market exercise. And yet, we've got more flights than ever where the demand is in the day, so I think it's a great thing from a financial and flight performance perspective. Yes, I would expect that -- I wouldn't expect that trend cutting early and late to continue at the pace it has over the past 5 years. So I think we're more stable now, but I don't see us going back.","Gary C. Kelly","For us, we've got opportunities to consider. Red-eye flying and things like that, and that is something that Bob and Mike are thinking about, but we don't have any plans to make any material change in the way we're scheduling the fleet, for any reason for that matter. But that would be the 1 exception perhaps to the shoulder flying comments.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a quick clarification for Tammy on non-passenger demand. Did you say other revenue would decline here a bit more than in Q1 or freight mail and other. It doesn't make a huge difference, but I wanted to clarify.","Tammy Romo","I said other. And that's just obviously, as we're moving AirTran flying over to Southwest, that would be the ancillary revenues. But -- and so we'll see that's just simply the remainder of ancillary charges going away as we move them over to the AirTran brand.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then, a question -- I'm sorry, were you adding something else?","Gary C. Kelly","Jamie, I was just going to clarify that at least on the freight side, since we haven't talked about freight, we are adding more and more markets since AirTran did not previously carry freight. So I think we have decent opportunities to grow the freight revenue category. But the other category that you asked about that Tammy mentioned, yes, that will continue to decline.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then, Gary, a question on the progress with the pilots. The challenge that I'm facing is that your existing contract already appears to be among the industry's more, if not most, efficient. And I certainly understand that the pilots like to see wages increase. I mean, that makes perfectly good sense. What's less clear is what management's ask [ph] might look like in terms of improved economics. It's not like you need scope really for RJs or anything like that. So I know you don't want to negotiate in public, but are there any competitor contracts that you could point to and you'd say, \"Hey, Airline X over there has some really interesting flexibility in the pilot contracts,\" something like that?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, Jamie, you're right, we are efficient. But we have things that are tangible today that are under discussion that would give Southwest more flexibility and make Southwest more efficient. So as good as we are, there are always things that can change. And as a matter of fact, there are absolutely some examples with competitors. And if you will permit me, I won't share who those are. But in any event, absolutely, there's always opportunities with every workgroup, always, to find ways to improve. And the nice thing is we're doing well, we've got good news, there are definitely some things that we can do for our people going forward as well and keep Southwest strong and build well for all our employees, and that's a wonderful place to be.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. And as always, if there are any follow-on questions, please feel free to call. We appreciate you all joining today, and have a great day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communication and Outreach.","Linda B. Rutherford","Thanks, Tom. For the media folks on the call, if you've got a question, go ahead. And Tom, let them know how they can queue up for that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now begin with our first question from Terry Maxon with the Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxon","As you are probably aware of, Virgin America has scheduled an event tomorrow to announce something about their Dallas operations. The -- have you got a sense that the competition for those gates have been settled? Have you gotten any word whether Virgin America is getting them or that you're out of the competition for them?","Gary C. Kelly","Terry, we are waiting patiently to see what the next step is in the process. So as far as I am aware, we are still in the running for consideration.","Terry Maxon","Delta wants the City of Dallas to take control of the gates and make them common use gates. Is that an acceptable alternative to Southwest? Or do you believe that, one way or the other, one airline should definitely get them?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think that sort of gets into the contractual aspect of the lease, and nothing that I really want to comment on. So I can understand why somebody would argue for that, but it's going to be up to the City of Dallas and its lease with American and their sublease rights to determine how to apply this. So I'd rather not comment on that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star Telegram.","Andrea Ahles","So I think Terry asked part of my question, which is about the Love Field gates. But I was wondering if you could also talk about how has demand been for the new flights since you released the schedule? Have you had a lot of interested people on the Love Field flights and which might be getting on it [ph] ? Are you considering other cities you might be adding in 2015 if you get those gates or if -- as you start to improve your schedule going forward at Love Field?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, Love Field is -- of course, it's going to happen, so we've already preannounced that we'll be selling more flights to more destinations sometime soon. So we're not taking bookings yet, Andrea, as I think you know, on the 15 new nonstop destinations that we've announced. That's a \"stay tuned.\" I think Tammy mentioned already that our business out of Love Field is up significantly. It's up double digit this year even without the new flights yet. So I don't know that we can quite explain that other than just a great service that our Southwest warriors offer every day. But yes, our business in Love Field is good, and we're looking forward to launching the new service here later this year.","Andrea Ahles","Do you know when you're going to make those flights available for purchase?","Gary C. Kelly","I do know.","Andrea Ahles","When would that be?","Gary C. Kelly","Linda, have we disclosed that yet?","Linda B. Rutherford","We've not yet at the time.","Gary C. Kelly","We haven't said that yet, so stay tuned.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Aaron Karp with Air Transport World.","Aaron Karp","You talked about how you think the international flying will be a relatively modest component for the next few years. How much of a revenue enhancement do you think international will be near term? And are you looking at it primarily as a long-term growth opportunity?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, over the long term, I think it's a large opportunity. We're thinking about it as North America. I would throw in Hawaii and Alaska, just because it is so different than flying in the 48 states, into that whole growth opportunity. We serve 96 cities today with Southwest and AirTran and have a potential to add 50 new destinations over some period of time, and that would be several hundreds worth of airplanes -- worth of flying. So it's a very material opportunity. And as I mentioned earlier, growing the airline is, in many ways, tactical. We've made the strategic investment to create the capability at Southwest to fly beyond the borders and to fly longer distances. So that strategic decision is made and is in place. Then where we decide to go within that geographic footprint, that will depend on a lot of factors. But in any event, I would absolutely expect that 1% would grow as a percentage of our total. At what rate, I'm not willing to predict yet.","Bob, I don't know if you have a number off the top of your head, what the potential is. I don't think it's going to be half of our business. It's not going to be anything like that. I'd be surprised if it was 25% of our business. But it could probably be in the 10%, 15% range, don't you think?","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, I think so. The domestic market is obviously much more mature. So the international markets that we're looking at are -- there's still a lot of room for development, so more room for competition, a lot of higher fares. Obviously, those will connect very well to our very mature domestic network, our very wide domestic network. So I think there's a lot of opportunity there. But it's a lot of opportunity on a relatively small base compared to the total. So yes, I would expect, to Gary's number, sort of the high-single digits, low-double digits is where I feel like we can grow to. But again, that growth rate -- the growth potential on the current base is much larger simply because the base is so small today.","Gary C. Kelly","And again, this all assumes 737 service. The geographic footprint is all of North America, including the Caribbean and actually, the northern reaches of South America. So it's a very exciting opportunity, 200 airplanes. I didn't do the math in my head, but that would be about, not quite 1\/3 increase in the fleet. So it's longer-haul flying, which takes longer, and it is higher revenue, so maybe our 10% to% 15 estimate is low. But we need to walk before we run here, and we're excited and ready to get started.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda B. Rutherford","Thank you, Tom. If anybody has any follow-up, members of the media can reach out to our folks in the communications department, and have a wonderful afternoon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation."],"19633":["Southwest Airlines Co.

My name is Greg, and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Ryan Martinez","Thanks, Greg, and thank you all for joining us today. We need to cover a few disclaimers before today's comments. First, we will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectation of [Technical Difficulty]. We'll also reference non-GAAP results, which exclude special items both in our earnings release. Also given the ongoing MAX groundings our current outlook is based on the most recent guidance from Boeing. That includes an assumption of regulatory approval of the MAX return to service during fourth quarter 2019. Any changes to these assumptions could result in additional adjustments to our flight schedule beyond January 5th, as well as further aircraft delivery delays and that could result in additional financial impacts. Please also check our IR website for more detailed information and disclosures.","So we've got a great lineup of speakers today including Mike Van de Ven, our Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; Tammy Romo, our Executive Vice President and CFO.","And to kick us off, I will turn over the call to our Chairman and CEO, Gary Kelly.","Gary Kelly","Thank you, Ryan. And thanks everybody for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. This year turned out to be quite a wild ride. We had some subplots earlier in the year, but the story is overwhelmed by the MAX grounding. The good news is we were exceptionally well prepared for the unexpected. We are healthier than ever and that's despite the body blow from the MAX, and we'll get through it, and we will get back on track.","The frustrating thing since our last call is that the MAX grounding has extended much longer than we had anticipated. Of course that's no surprise now given that this news was revealed last month. Boeing won't have the latest software fix done until September. And in the meantime, we will be operating a great airline and produce very strong financial results all without any amounts from a Boeing settlement.","Our people have done a heroic job, and I don't use that word lightly. And not only are they resilient, they're tough, they are brilliant, they are compassionate, and I want to thank them for a job well done. Our frontline employees have truly risen to the occasion dealing with 20,000 flight cancellations. But you don't hear a lot about our back office folks and we have numerous unsung heroes, so I want to sing for them. The frontline is at a hard time \u2013 they certainly have a hard time completing their mission without a plan.","And our planners that, I'm going to have to rename re-planners have done an amazing job and I would lead that off with network planning, our operations planning, our financial planning groups, just to name a few. They have worked grueling hours, they have improvised, and they have really, really delivered. And I'm very proud of everybody.","While the financial results are remarkably strong, strong margins, strong cash flow, revenues, and a really good cost performance, there's a lot of news in the press release. You're going to get a lot of excellent insights from Mike, Tom and Tammy, but I would like to point out just a few things.","Number one, it's really all about the MAX. That's the only issue that we are dealing with and of course, it's helpful just to have one thing to be able to focus on. So everything else within the company is rock solid.","Secondly, business is strong. Second quarter came in as expected. We had strong RASM. Third quarter is forecasted up 3% to 5%, which is right where it should be relative to second quarter.","Thirdly, our cost management is solid. Taking into account the MAX and the out-of-service aircraft we are where we expect to be, if not better for the second third and \u2013 quarters and in the full year. We told you all at the beginning of the year that we were looking at flat CASM-Ex in the second half and that's where we think we will be taking again the MAX into account.","Fourthly, Newark, any student of Southwest will quickly understand our approach here and this is a tactical decision forced by the MAX groundings and the painful cut of 8% of our capacity. As a little bit of background, we acquired 18 Newark slot pairs in 2010 and that was a consequence of the United Continental merger where they were required to divest some slots. So we did that deal in about 24 hours.","At that time, we had virtually no presence at LaGuardia, and in fact had only been there for about a year. On the LaGuardia side of things in 2011, we acquired more slots at LaGuardia with our AirTran acquisition. In 2013, we acquired yet again more slots from the divestiture caused by the U.S. Airways and American merger. So we find ourselves with a significantly larger presence at LaGuardia than we had contemplated back in 2010 when we went into Newark. We also find ourselves in a magnificent facility, which is certainly significantly better than what we started with in 2009.","So, we currently offer 37 daily departures from LaGuardia that will be as of October. New York is a huge market, but for us it is a destination market. Given our relatively small position at Newark and LaGuardia, and our inability to add any meaningful number of flights to these market, it makes sense for us to consolidate our New York City flying into one airport.","LaGuardia is the choice for the vast majority of our New York City bound customers. And it's not out of character for us. We consolidated our operations in a couple of Ohio locations in 2017. We consolidated Flint Michigan into Detroit in 2018. And then with larger markets like Chicago, Houston, Dallas, we served one airport. Newark underperforms financially, and to offset our reduction in service there we'll be able to add seats at LaGuardia, and be more productive with a superior financial result. So that's what's happening with Newark.","The other thing, I could add is that as to the timing, it's very straightforward. We need the airplanes. We can't afford in this highly competitive environment where our capacity overall is cut to have underperforming assets, which leads to my fifth point, which is Hawaii. We'll be resuming our expansion without having to wait on the MAX any further and as we described in the press release. Adding Hawaii and quickly becoming relevant is strategic for us, and this move better supports execution of that strategy.","So to be clear, we aren't backing off of New York City with this move, but we are accelerating our growth in California and Hawaii.","So those are the high points. And to kick us off with more details and better insights, I'm going to turn the call over to first, our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Mike Van de Ven.","Mike Van de Ven","Well thanks, Gary. I want to start just by reiterating what Gary said about our people. They are indeed resilient and they make this company great by taking care of our customers, our operations and each other. And I am immensely thankful for their efforts. Well in an environment where we have 34 MAX aircraft out of service, our performance for the quarter, I believe was very good.","Most importantly, we took very good care of our customers. First, we used all of our spare aircraft to cover any scheduled MAX flying through June 7. We then reaccommodated the remaining impacted customers to other flights where possible. So we ran an all-time quarterly record load factor of 86.4%. And we did that without any spare aircraft from April 1 to June 7.","And just to state the obvious, spares are important. They protect against unexpected events like the unforecasted hail event we had in Denver on May 28. And that took 24 aircraft out of service for a period of up to two weeks in a time we were already without spares. So in that kind of environment, with no margin for recovery for any unexpected events like that, our people found a way to get 85% of our customers to their destinations within 30 minutes per scheduled arrival time.","Through aircraft swaps, crew changes, extending the operating day just whatever it took. And just as a reminder, we schedule our operations with less block and turn time than any other carrier in the industry to begin with. We carried 99.5% of the checked bags on the flights they were checked on. We led all marketing carriers with the lowest DOT customer complaint ratio and our Net Promoter Score was still industry-leading at about 59% for the quarter.","Now all those numbers were down a bit from last year, but given the impacts of the MAX grounding to have our overall operations results still in the upper tier of the industry is really a testament to the people of Southwest Airlines. Going into the third quarter in the peak summer travel month, we are focused on continuing to improve all aspects of our operational liability. So we've operated with the appropriate spare levels beginning in June eight and we're going to carry that throughout the year. And we're already seeing improvements in the reliability of our service. So our on-time performance which was really the most significantly impacted item has rebounded nicely since adding back the spares.","We finished the month of June fourth place in the industry with respect to marketing carriers and we expect to finish July either third or fourth. And of course, one of the carriers ahead of us is Hawaiian and they benefit by a larger percentage of their network being interisland service in Hawaii. So, in terms of delivering our product in a reliable and a hospitable manner, I'm very pleased with our performance thus far.","Turning to the MAX. While the operational challenges are manageable, they do grow in complexity as the groundings extend. So Boeing, as Gary mentioned still has work, they must complete. The FAA must review and improve that work before granting regulatory approval of the return to MAX to service and we are in continued conversations with Boeing and the FAA. And as Ryan said earlier, we are dependent on them for a timeline to return the MAX to service.","As we mentioned in the press release, we're in the process of removing all MAX aircraft from service through January 5. So, I'll walk you through a high level outline of our approach to reintroducing the MAX to our regularly scheduled service on January 6.","Before I start with that just for context when the MAX grounding is lifted, we're going to have three groups of aircraft to address and each of them have a unique process. So first, we have a 34 aircraft, MAX aircraft that Southwest has in long-term storage in Victorville, California. Second, we're going to have a group of aircraft that Boeing is storing that have not yet been through the delivery process to Southwest Airlines. So we don't own those airplanes and they're not on our operating certificates.","And then lastly, there will be aircraft coming from the Boeing production line after the grounding is lifted which we will want to except as delivered in the normal course of business. The first step in the process regardless of the grouping is instruction from the FAA as to the specific requirements that will be mandated to make the fleet operational. That will likely include software uploads and\/or other technical requirements to the aircraft along with some required pilot training.","Now we're going to assume that the pilot training requirements will not include additional simulator training. We have an agreed-upon 30-day time frame with our pilot union to complete the expected computer-based training and we plan to -- we plan to time the work to bring the aircraft back into the operational fleet to correspond to the end of our pilot training period, so that every pilot is prepared to fly every aircraft in the fleet.","In addition to those mandated activities, there will be additional maintenance procedures to transition the aircraft from long-term storage into an operational readiness state. And at this point, we believe that those activities and approvals could take one to two months to complete for the Victorville aircraft and that we could intake up to three Boeing storage aircraft per week once they're ready to begin their storage deliveries.","So as I mentioned, we plan to take production aircraft as they're available for delivery. Our delivery schedule with Boeing continues to evolve as their production and their schedules change. And we expect the majority of our 41 contracted deliveries for the remainder of this year which by the way would have been in the Boeing storage grouping and will likely be moving into 2020.","Assuming regulatory approval to return the MAX to service by early November, our baseline plan will be to control the process, so we can provide the network at least 30 MAX aircraft to the operational fleet by January 6 schedule and then we would ramp from there in a controlled fashion depending on the delivery schedules. So that approach is intended to balance as best we can aircraft availability with customer demand in early 2020, then match the crew staffing to the aircraft availability.","In terms of the pilot staffing, given the removal of the MAX line through January 5, we're going to defer our October pilot new hire class and the associated captain upgrade class until March or April next year. And so, while there is some cost savings in 2019 from deferring those classes, the primary driver was to better match flight crews with their flying needs to give them more productive schedules.","In closing, I'm very proud of our people and our performance this quarter. And as it relates to the MAX, we have a plan to remove MAX flying for the remainder of the year. We have the detailed plans for the ungrounding of the fleet once that occurs. We have an idea of how we can resume taking deliveries from Boeing and we're ready to make adjustments to those plans if we need to.","So, just as our people are doing this summer, we really want to be prepared to provide exceptional customer service to our customers for the holidays later this year. So, we remain focused on running a safe, reliable, and on time, and an enjoyable operation and I really think we've got the best team in the industry to do just that.","And with that, I will turn it over to Tom.","Tom Nealon","Okay. Well, thanks Mike. Good morning -- or I guess good afternoon everybody. So, as Gary and Mike both said this has been a challenging quarter. But I think in spite of the issues we've had to deal with our results were very strong. We produced record passenger revenues, record operating revenues in the quarter, along with a record load factor of 86.4%, which I think by any measure is a pretty impressive set of results, especially considering what we're going through.","I think what's equally impressive just to reemphasize what Mike said was simply the quality of the operation in spite of the MAX cancellations. Our on-time performance was strong, our customer satisfaction scores, our brand scores remain at the very top of the industry. I know that you guys hear this a lot and you may think it's a throwaway line, but these results truly are because of our people.","Mike and Gary and I have spent a lot of time in the stations this past quarter. And I can tell you the morale is high and the focus of our people is very clear eyes on running a great operation and taking care of our customers. And you can see it in our metrics and you can see it and read it and here it in the feedback from our customers. It's pretty amazing.","From a schedule perspective, we've been very focused on maintaining the strength of our network, albeit with significantly fewer aircraft than we've planned. Our network team, as Gary has already alluded to, has done an absolutely incredible job of adjusting and republishing our schedules.","And our revenue management team has done an equally incredible job of managing the revenue environments. And there's no doubt that we're continuing to benefit the revenue management capabilities that were enabled by our new reservation system.","Overall, I'm very pleased with our second quarter RASM result of 6.8% year-over-year growth which is right in line with the improved guidance that we provided in our June 19th Investor Update.","And just as a reminder on the April 25th earnings call, we expected Q2 RASM to increase in the range of 5.5% to 7.5%. And as you might recall, there were several key things that we entered in that original guidance.","Just a quick summary of that. First, we were expecting an improvement in leisure demand trends as compared to the first quarter. We also had expectations of solid demand for both leisure and business travel and both of these held true throughout the second quarter and actually improved each month during the quarter. So, we're pleased with that.","Second, we were expecting a strong yield environment, especially with close-in fares which we did in fact experience. And we actually saw a slight improvement in our base business as we progressed through the second quarter as supported by our system-wide fare increase in mid-May.","Third, we are expecting a one point year-over-year RASM benefit from our reservation system which occurred as expected. Next we are expecting a one point year-over-year RASM benefit in the lower capacity due to the removal of MAX flights in the schedules. This action ended up being about two points.","Fifth, we had three points of year-over-year tailwinds from second quarter 2018 items including Flight 1380 as well as last year's suboptimal flight schedule. And finally no surprise we had a half point year-over-year benefit in the Easter shift out of Q1.","So, these six drivers net out for a 6.8% RASM growth for Q2 which again is a very strong performance, especially considering the challenges. Both our domestic and international businesses performed well in the quarter with international RASM performance being especially robust in particular in our Mexican beach markets.","Obviously, Q2 was not without execution risk. Our network planning team has the challenge of removing MAX flying from Q2 and we had to manually work our way through March and republish our April and our June base schedules in such a way that best maintains the integrity of our network.","Our revenue management team had to manage through a bit more due to grounding of the MAX which reduced our higher yielding inventory due to past -- passenger re-accommodations in particular with close-in inventory during April. But the impact also carried them through the first half of May.","So, we had a lot of moving parts to manage to throughout the quarter and I think the commercial team's execution was simply extraordinary. They were incredibly focused and the result was that they were able to produce flight schedules that mitigated as much risk as possible. And these schedules work for our customers, but they also work for Southwest both operationally and commercially.","Our ancillary products also performed very well in Q2 with other revenue being up 11% year-over-year. And we continue to have a lot of success with our EarlyBird variable pricing product which we implemented last fall and which was enabled by our new reservation system.","We also launched a new business-oriented credit card last month as we planned which is targeted at our small to medium-sized business customers. And so far the early results are very, very strong.","We had another extraordinarily strong performance from our Rapid Rewards program this past quarter. Our total loyalty program revenue grew 15% in the second quarter and we continue to have strong credit card acquisitions. And our credit card retention rates also continue to be very high.","So, we're obviously very pleased with the performance of our Rapid Rewards program which by the way continues to be recognized most recently as program of the year by the Freddie Awards for Best Loyalty Card, Best Airline Redemption Building, and Best Customer Service.","The economics of the program are very, very strong. The customer benefits are best-in-class and we see a tremendous number of opportunities to significantly grow the Rapid Rewards program going forward. So, that's it for Q2.","So, let's talk about Q3. So, our third quarter business trends continue to be very strong as well. We continue to see healthy leisure and business travel demand across the booking curve and a positive year-over-year yield trend thus far. And we're expecting a strong Q3 RASM performance in the range of up 3% to 5%.","And just as a reminder, the MAX aircraft are already on the schedule through the entire third quarter which means we don't have the same closed-in re-accommodation challenges we had coming into Q2.","Our Q3 RASM outlook does have a one point benefit due to headwinds from Q3 2018, which is made up of 0.5 point from 1380 and 0.5 point again from our suboptimal schedule from last year.","Similar to the second quarter, we are estimating a year-over-year RASM benefit in Q3 of about two points from the reduced capacity due to the MAX grounding and we expect a 0.5 year-over-year RASM benefit from our new reservation system.","We are seeing a slight negative impact to Rapid Reward redemptions and ancillary revenue as a result of MAX-related flight cancellations, but we still expect another strong year-over-year performance of both categories.","Turning to Hawaii, well I can tell you this, Hawaii is off to a fantastic start. And although we're early on in our expansion, our results so far are exceeding our expectations in every category. So, we're now up to 14 daily flights, six in California two Hawaii, and eight interisland round-trip flights.","Demand for our service to Hawaii is very, very strong and our load factors are far exceeding our system average. Our Hawaii in-flight product and customer experience is performing extremely well with our Net Promoter Scores above our system average which as you know were also very high.","Demand for our interisland service is also very strong and is made up of a very strong mix of local customers. And the brand and customer experience for us for the interisland service is actually above our total system performance which again leads the industry.","And our fares are where we'd expect them to be at this point. It is fair to say that we're seeing the Southwest Effect in the markets that we're serving and this is obviously enabled by our low-cost structure.","Now regarding the eventual transition of Hawaii flight to MAX, we're obviously very eager to realize the cost efficiencies. But we can fly the 800 NGs to Hawaii as long as we need to while the MAX is grounded. As we announced this morning we have more Hawaii service plan to go on sale soon, so we'll talk about that more later.","Now looking forward, our commercial team will continue to be very proactive in managing any additional MAX flight cancellations and network adjustments through the end of the year. And as you'd expect, we'll continue to be very focused on our execution. And our 2019 RASM outlook continues to be year-over-year growth in excess of 3%.","Now regarding the capacity impact to Q4 RASM, we'll be at a point where we are approaching a 75 MAX aircraft deficit by year-end and as such the estimated revenue penalty from second quarter grow sequentially into the third quarter and grows further in the fourth quarter.","So, when combined with the normal seasonality in the peak versus off-peak nature of Q4 and the complexity of the holiday schedule, we simply still have work to do over the next month or so. So, it's too early for us to give any guidance or perspective on the impact to our fourth quarter RASM. But one of our priorities clearly is to protect holiday travel and minimize the impact for our customers. But as you know the schedule changes and the decisions get tougher as our fleet deficit grows.","And finally, despite the challenges that we faced, the Southwest brand remains very strong. Our Net Promoter Scores are tremendous, and we remain at the very top of the industry in spite of our challenges. And we expect to continue to grow revenues, despite declining year-over-year capacity here in the near-term. And as with our Q2 results, our Q3 RASM outlook should also put us at or near the top of the industry.","So with that update, I'll turn it over to Tammy.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Tom and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I'd like to add my thanks to all of our terrific employees for their focus and hard work. Our people are simply the best, and they have proven that time and time again.","Gary, Mike and Tom have outlined the challenges that we've been managing through with the MAX groundings and I will round out our remarks with some commentary on the MAX impact on our cost, fleet and capacity plans and our balance sheet and cash flow.","Starting with cost. I'd like to commend our people for a great job at managing cost in a challenging quarter. Our second quarter nominal cost, excluding fuel and profit sharing, came in a little better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter.","On a unit basis, ex-fuel special items and profit sharing, our cost increased 10.9% year-over-year. The impact of the MAX groundings drove six points of this year-over-year increase with the remainder of the increase primarily related to planned increases in salary wages and benefits, maintenance spend, and airport cost.","Our second quarter CASM-Ex increase was favorable to the guidance we provided in our June investor update when we were expecting a year-over-year increase in the 11.5% to 12.5% range. Following our investor update, the combination of the grounded MAX aircraft and weather resulted in a lower completion factor than expected which drove ASMs down further. However, the incremental unit cost pressure was more than offset by lower-than-expected airport cost, shifting of advertising and maintenance expenses to future quarters, and solid cost controls.","Turning to third quarter. The year-over-year unit cost pressure due to the MAX groundings continued. We started the year expecting about two points of inflation in CASM-Ex in third quarter 2019. We now expect seven points of the year-over-year CASM-Ex impact from the groundings in this quarter compared with the previously communicated three-point impact I mentioned on our April earnings call, when we had the MAX aircraft removed from our flight scheduled through August 5.","When combined with about a one point increase in year-over-year CASM-Ex from cost shifting from first half 2019, we now expect our third quarter 2019 CASM-Ex to increase in the 9% to 11% range year-over-year. Sans shifting and the MAX impact, our third quarter CASM-Ex is relatively in line with our cost plan at the beginning of the year.","The good news is that we have gained some non-fuel cost offsets for third quarter, as our flight schedule changes were well in advance of our flight crew bidding process and we also had temporarily lowered landing fees.","As Mike mentioned, we've also temporarily delayed some flight crew hiring. These offsets pale in comparison to the year-over-year unit cost penalty, but we are doing what we can to mitigate near-term pressure and we will continue to do so.","Looking at the full year, our current guidance is based on MAX cancellations through January 5. The MAX groundings are driving an incremental six points to full year CASM-Ex year-over-year as we are six to seven points off our original capacity growth plan to grow 2019 ASMs nearly 5%. Therefore, we currently estimate annual 2019 CASM-Ex to increase in the 8% to 10% range year-over-year.","As a reminder, our annual CASM-Ex increase also includes the previously communicated 0.5 point increase year-over-year from cost related to the ratified agreement with our mechanics and approximately $10 million of incremental maintenance expense for seven of our 737-700 aircraft that we have decided to keep instead of retire this year, which I'll cover in a moment.","I won't spend too much time on fuel as the market held fairly steady through second quarter. Our second quarter economic fuel price was right around the mid-point of our most recent guidance at $2.13 per gallon which included hedging gains per gallon of $0.06 and premium expense per gallon of $0.05.","We have a great fuel hedging protection in place this year, with about a 65% hedge in both third and fourth quarters. Our hedging premiums for this year remain at approximately $95 million or about $0.05 per gallon, and we have a 58% hedge position for 2020. So, we are well prepared.","For third quarter 2019 based on market prices as of July 19 and given our current hedge, we expect our fuel price per gallon to fall in the $2.05 to $2.15 range.","As I mentioned last quarter, our fuel efficiency has been significantly impacted by the MAX grounding. Second quarter ASMs per gallon declined 1.7% year-over-year and third quarter ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year-over-year in the 1% to 2% range.","This decline highlights the fuel efficiency of the MAX which is about 14% better than the 737 NG fleet. Once the MAX returns to service, we expect to get back on track with our desired fuel efficiency gains.","Turning to fleet and capacity. We have not taken delivery of any aircraft since the MAX groundings in mid-March and we didn't retire any aircraft this quarter. So we started and ended the quarter with 753 airplanes. We don't have an update to our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing at this point, which shows 41 remaining deliveries this year. But we expect the majority of these will shift to 2020.","We have been working through the delivery delays with Boeing. Based on their guidance, we are currently assuming, we will get 16 aircraft deliveries during fourth quarter 2019 which includes seven leased aircraft. To help mitigate the impact of the delivery delays, we are postponing the retirement of seven of our own -700s. With this in mind, we now expect to retire 11 -700s this year versus original retirement plan of 18.","Turning back to second quarter, our ASMs declined 3.6% year-over-year. For third quarter, given the absence of the MAX aircraft for the entire quarter, we expect capacity to be down in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. With the extension of the MAX cancellations through year-end, fourth quarter 2019 capacity is expected to be flat to down 1% year-over-year.","So looking at our second half 2019 plans versus where we are now, the impact of the groundings is far greater in the back half of the year and, of course, that's a function of the growing number of MAX aircraft we had planned to have in our fleet. For full year 2019, we now estimate capacity to be down in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year.","And finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with very healthy cash and short-term investments of approximately $4 billion. We originally estimated our total 2019 CapEx spend would be in the $1.9 billion to $2 billion range, with approximately $1 billion in aircraft-related spend.","Based on Boeing's most recent guidance for our remaining deliveries this year, we now expect total 2019 CapEx to be in the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range with aircraft-related CapEx to be in the $400 million to $500 million range. The $500 million to $600 million reduction in this year's aircraft CapEx will shift to 2020, assuming the deliveries delays are caught up next year.","Despite the year-to-date operating income penalty of $225 million from the MAX groundings, $175 million of which was in the second quarter, we generated strong operating cash flows in the first half of the year of $2.1 billion, with free cash flow of $1.7 billion, allowing us to return $1.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","In closing, I'd like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees who are managing through all the challenges the MAX groundings have presented. I am tremendously pleased with our financial results this quarter. Despite the negative financial impacts and operational challenges from the MAX groundings and the 20,000 canceled flights, we still managed to produce strong margins and all-time high quarterly revenues, load factors and earnings per diluted share.","Our pre-tax return on invested capital was a strong 23.4% even with a 1 to 2 point year-to-date penalty from the MAX grounding. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong, allowing us to continue to provide meaningful shareholder return.","Our revenue production is strong and we continue to benefit significantly from our new revenue management system our Rapid Rewards program and ancillary revenues. We have a great fuel hedging protection in place in 2019 and beyond to mitigate fuel price pressure. While lower capacity is putting year-over-year pressure on our non-fuel unit costs, we remain diligent on controlling the cost we can.","Based on what we know today, we continue to expect solid margins in 2019 at or near industry-leading FX, even with the MAX penalty, with the opportunity to continue delivering stellar returns on capital. We will get past our near-term challenges from the MAX groundings and our second quarter 2019 financial results demonstrate the strength of our low-cost business model, our network and our amazing people.","With that, Greg, I'll turn it back to you now to take questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Gary, I know you've got versions of this question on the last call, but just given everything that's going on with the MAX I thought it was important to ask again. I guess when does the risk tied to having a single fleet type offset the economics of that single fleet type?","Gary Kelly","Andrew, yes, thanks for the question. It's something that we'll want to explore. There's no way to avoid risk with a fleet. Period. If we had one manufacturer that's 50% today and the other is 50%, 50% of our fleet being grounded would be a huge problem. So I don't have anything new to tell you today. We think that Boeing is a very strong company, a great partner and believe that the MAX 8 is the best airplane in its category. We haven't learned anything different in 90 days to change our view on that.","I think the nuance of your question is something that we'll want to explore, because in the current scenario some of our competitors who do have a diversified fleet aren't having their growth plans impacted as drastically as we are. But the odds of having this unique scenario again and then executing a plan that's so narrowly focused on avoiding this, I don't -- right now, I just don't think that would be very wise.","But the short answer is, right now, we don't see that we need a change in strategy. The longer answer is, I think, it's something that needs to be fully explored and debated and that's not something we're going to do in 90 days. As a practical matter, if we want to diversify the fleet, it would take us years. So absent going out and acquiring another carrier and operating a separate airline in that sense, there's just no easy way around that.","Andrew Didora","Fair enough. Thank you for that color there, Gary. My second question maybe for Tammy. Just want to get your thoughts around IMO 2020 and your hedging policies. The 58% hedge in 2020 how much of that is just a WTI as compared to jet tracks and just curious to get your expectations for the potential impact of this regulation on jet fuel? Thanks.","Tammy Romo","Yes \u2013 no, thanks for the question. We've been contemplating IMO 2020 for quite some time and that has certainly involved \u2013 informed our hedging strategy. We have about a 10% position in heating oil for 2020 and we have a combination of Brent and WTI. So we have a diversified portfolio, and we feel like we're positioned well should we see prices increase \u2013 or the crack spreads rather increase from current levels. And just in case you missed it in our earnings release, we have a 58% hedge for 2020. So, again very well hedged.","Andrew Didora","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Tammy Romo","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Moving on, from Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi.","Joseph DeNardi","Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Gary, I'm wondering, if you can just talk about given the plan that Mike laid out for reintroducing the MAX how we should think about capacity growth and if you'd like to discuss that CASM-Ex kind of into next year just given all the moving pieces? Thank you.","Gary Kelly","Mike has a lot of work to do, when you think about the variability in the Boeing delivery schedule from here. So all we can do at this point is put a stake in the ground make some assumptions. I think we've been clear what our assumptions are here for the near-term. I think when you then under the assumption that we hit those dates, Mike, where Boeing has done in September FAA signs off in October, and we begin taking deliveries I guess that would be sometime in December let's say. Right now, we're making assumptions as to how many airplanes we can physically un-ground ourselves, how many Boeing can physically unground and then how many Boeing can deliver.","So there is three different sources of MAX 8s and there's always so many. We can do in a day or in a week. And we just don't know. We're in uncharted territory there. So I think that has some bearing. We've got a retirement plan for some number of Tammy MAX or rather a 737-700s planned for next year. We have some interest in either accelerating or decelerating the retirements. So we'll just have to see.","At this point, I'll tell you our overarching goal is we want as many MAXes as we can practically deploy as soon as possible. And if we don't like the resulting capacity then I think we would then lean more heavily to perhaps accelerate some of the -700s. As we look at all of our route performance, and just market after market after market it is obvious that we're short capacity that we're spilling traffic and leaving money on the table and helping our competitors. And I will also tell you that that is not anything that we will leave unattended.","So if there's a range of behavior that you would expect from us next year from never reckless from being aggressive, to being passive, I can assure you we're going to want to restore our operation and our system just as quickly as again we can safely and efficiently do that. But a lot of questions and right now its unproductive to try to give you any number about what that might be. My goal would be by the time we get to the end of next year to hope that we were back smoothly on our delivery schedule and our operation. And I think it's possible that we beat that by six months just depending on, whether \u2013 again whether we meet the current time frame and whether Boeing can deliver at the rate that we are assuming next year.","Tammy Romo","And just to maybe jump in to help with what all this means for our 2020 cost, well the MAX groundings are obviously creating a material impact on our year-over-year ASM growth in CASM-Ex trends for 2019, and our long-term unit cost target is unchanged. Our unit cost goal excluding fuel and profit sharing is annual year-over-year growth below 2% as I discussed on last quarter's call. And I just do want to point out that this cost target includes our estimates for salary, wages and benefits, and increases for our people.","We are experiencing pressure on our 2019 unit cost, due to the lower capacity as a result of the MAX groundings. And that's about again six points to the full year. And while this does create some near-term challenges for us, these pressures are one-time, and will pass. The year-over-year comparisons for next year obviously would be more favorable given this year's impact from the grounding. So in terms of just a target for next year, it would be to absolutely drive towards declining year-over-year CASM-Ex in 2020.","Joseph DeNardi","That's very helpful. And then Gary, just another one for you, given your tenure at the airline can you just talk about over the last 25 years how the economics of your partnership with Chase have changed? What that means for helping the durability of your business over a cycle? And then, where your economics are now relative to the industry given that you most recently did the deal in 2015? And it's pretty clear that the economics have become more favorable for airlines over the past few years? Thank you.","Gary Kelly","Yeah. So I'll give you a quick comment. And then Tom would love for you to opine on that topic. But just starting with 25 years, I think 25 years ago we didn't have an affinity card and saw that as a great opportunity.","And so in the industry I don't know that I have as much of a perspective there. But certainly for us, yeah, we've come a long way in 25 years. When I started as CEO in 2004 we quickly concluded that the number one enhancement that we needed to make for the Southwest brand was to overhaul our frequent flyer program, and Tom covered a lot of material in his remarks, but I'll just cover it again. It is an award-winning industry-leading frequent flyer program and that is the foundation for the obviously driving the revenues.","We have a great plan. Our customers love it. They take our credit card in droves and we obviously factor all of that into our economics. So we are far more stable I would say in terms of our revenue generation today than we were before. Then the new program was launched in 2011 very proud of that. That may be even the single biggest accomplishment that Southwest had over the last 10 years to 15 years. It was really, really significant.","Tom, you want to -- anything you want to add on the economics? Obviously, we hold a lot of that very close to the vest, but it seems that\u2026","Tom Nealon","We do all the economics really close to vest. What I can tell you is just the growth of the program has continues to be incredible. It's just a massive growth engine for us. The retention, the customer affinity, the value of that customer is just so much greater than our non-card-holding customer. But we don't get into the economics of it. What I can tell you is we are really thrilled with the partnership. We're thrilled for a long time. We did as you know -- well not going to get into that either. But we are really thrilled with Chase. It's a good partnership.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker ","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for the time. I'm not sure who can answer this question. But when you talk about the pilot training and taking one to two months, do you have to put them through the simulator? Can you just sort of maybe address that?","Mike Van de Ven","Hi, Helane. This is Mike. We're not expecting to have to put them through the simulator for the pilot training on the MAX. What we believe is that there needs to be an awareness of the MCAS system, how that works what it's doing in the airplane and that there can be -- my understanding is there can be sufficient computer-based training that shows the pilots of what is going on there.","We have for x Southwest, we've been doing training with our pilots in terms of hand-flying the airplanes since kind of really the inception of the airline. And over the last two years we've introduced this training called the -- envelope training. And our pilots have been through scenarios where the airplanes are at the boundaries of their performance limits. And they've been in situations like the Ethiopian and Hawaiian Air incident and they've already been through simulator training for those kind of things. So this will be the second year that they've completed all of that.","So when you bundle all that together that's why we think that the computer-based training coming out of this grounding is appropriate. And then we supplement that ongoing with the recurrent training in the simulator.","Gary Kelly","Helane, the other thing that I would add which is really beyond your question, but it does -- it sort of explained the environment here. I think Southwest is the gold standard for the industry. We hire first officers that on average have 6,000 hours of flight experience. And in addition to that, we hire first officers that have captain experience. So you start with a very experienced cockpit crew.","Then we obviously only fly the 737, we are the industry leader when it comes to training and operations and Mike covered our philosophy about flying the airplane and training for certain scenarios. So we'll be very well prepared to take on this new training requirement. Our pilots, I think -- more importantly our pilots are very comfortable and love the MAX and are looking forward to restoring it to service.","And they'll play a key role obviously, when we communicate and when we're reintroducing the MAX to our customers. But we factored all of that into our plans. We're allowing more than ample time for the training and the reintroduction of the fleet.","And I think as we were talking earlier, what is going to be as much of a challenge, if maybe not more of a challenge is just the maintenance and the reintroduction of all the airplanes back into service will be a task. And again, I think that Mike has allowed more than enough time for that with our January 5th target date.","Helane Becker","Got you. And then can I just ask you one question about Newark, so I understand this? So this is not just a suspension of service. And when the MAX does come in you're going to go back? This is just leaving the market returning the slots?","Gary Kelly","Those -- right now, it's not slotted anymore. It was when we acquired them in 2010. But the FAA whatever that term is they unslotted them several years ago. But no this is a decision where -- and that's why I like the word consolidate. So we'll have a significant New York City presence. It will be focused where our customers want to go which is LaGuardia. And we have -- actually with the new facility and the 800s and the MAX 8 we have an opportunity to grow our seat capacity there by I don't know 10%, 20% over time.","So we have ample opportunity to do that, and we'll have a far more efficient cost-effective operation and revenue production by consolidating into one airport as opposed to having it diluted over two. So again, it's two still relatively small operations today that will consolidate into a much more efficient and arguably larger operation at LaGuardia.","Helane Becker","That's very helpful. Thank you everybody. Thanks Gary.","Operator","And next from JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Gary, I'm already kicking myself for asking this question last quarter because I'm basically going to ask it again today and probably will continue to do so for as long as the MAX remains grounded. Have you give any further thought to how long you can tolerate or would choose to tolerate year-on-year capacity declines before you potentially consider non-organic growth? You're clearly agitated by funneling profits and market share into your competitors' coffers. You've said as much today and I respect that. So I've got to imagine there's a breaking point out there somewhere.","Gary Kelly","Does that mean, I get to kick you too? Just kidding. ","Jamie Baker","And right after you said that things about my employer for a change on the call. ","Gary Kelly","Again, I'm just trying to be pragmatic without being overly legalistic here with you. Obviously, we can't comment on anything like that in substance. I mean, I'm just trying to play the game a little bit. As a practical matter, we came into this in March with a view that this was a short-term problem. And one of the things that I think we've tried to emphasize or clarify here today is that we've got a strategy we're executing the strategy and this is really not affecting any of that.","So all of that is a view that it\u2019s going to be ungrounded by the summer. And again it was disappointing to find yet another delay which essentially pushes it out to early next year. But all that we can handle and we can manage. So I think the tolerance -- and in fairness to your question the tolerance for this scenario goes well beyond that because then the nature of your question moves into a huge strategic question.","Jamie Baker","Correct.","Gary Kelly","And that -- so hopefully I made answer to your question. We're -- we can work our way through this. Obviously, the financial results that we've got right now are superb even in -- relative to our competitors it's actually incredible that we're -- that we compare so strongly and we'll get through this. We're going to end the year healthier than we started the year. And we've actually exercised a few new muscles here and there in really good shape. If we have to continue to manage a ragged schedule we're doing pretty well at that. So I just don't think that that's going to be an issue for us.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate that. As a -- and just as a follow-on to that I mean, I have a real quick question for Tammy you talked about some soul-searching as to this whole fleet-type structure. Should we assume that Boeing competitors are circling you more aggressively in the current environment than they ordinarily do? Or is that not the case?","Gary Kelly","That's always the case. And -- yes that's always the case. And again we've been open -- Mike has been looking at other airplanes and there's nothing. That's a duty we have. We want to know what's out there in the marketplace and we need to be comfortable that we've made the best decision for our company our shareholders our customers on and on and on. But -- so hopefully I answered that question.","Jamie Baker","And then a quick follow-up or a quick housekeeping for Tammy. How should we think about the engine overhaul expense on the 700s that you're keeping? Just wondering if that will hit the P&L or if the plan is to run them down before you park them? I suppose MAX I mean might impact that calculus. And thank you both. It's been an exceptionally thorough conference call, best one this season.","Tammy Romo","Well, thank you Jamie. And I don't want to kick you after that. So -- but we -- on your question on the maintenance expense there is about $10 million associated with pushing those seven aircraft and that's all contemplated in the guidance that we provided to you this morning. And that's going to hit fourth quarter as we pull\u2026.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Tammy Romo","Thank you. ","Operator","And next we have Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. So just this replanning challenge that you've been managing through in broad brush strokes you are going to grow mid-single digits in 4Q. By our math the MAX was more than 100% of that. The MAX was like 11 points of that growth. So ex-MAX your plan was actually to just shrink the fleet maybe shrink stage maybe shrink utilization. So can you just talk about how you practically unwind that? I assume in 4Q some of the aircraft were going away related to maintenance events that are due. Just in broad brush strokes how do you unwind that and minimize the schedule damage?","Gary Kelly","Tammy, would you mind if I take a swing at that? You can clean it up. Is that okay?","Tammy Romo","I do not mind at all.","Gary Kelly","Well, we're in the middle of the sausage-making with that. I would say that as the -- if we were to take the MAX out of the schedule gross for the fourth quarter I believe that is close to 11%. So again as a reference point we're talking about a reduction in the second quarter because of the MAX of 7%, 8% in third quarter. So it goes up because we have more airplanes. Now the holiday schedules are really complicated because of the vast difference between a peak day and an off-peak day.","And it's really complicated for our network planners. And they've really honed those schedules over the years and it's fully automated. And so this scenario blows all that up and they have to go back and now try to do it manually. We don't want to eliminate 10% to 11% of our capacity. And because of the off-peak days and the off-peak nature of some of the days there's an opportunity to add back some flying maybe fly the day longer and a few things like that where we could trim that back instead of being down 10% or 11% to something less.","And until we figure out what that is I'd rather not give you a number. But we do have that choice. It won't be the greatest schedule. It might come with some RASM penalty because some of those flights won't be optimal for our customers. But we will do it with and without here. What's more productive from a profit perspective versus narrowly focusing on CASM or RASM independently and that's the way we're thinking about it.","But I don't know if that's where you were coming from with your question. But you are correct that the fourth quarter is more complicated because of the number of different schedules and because I think Tom said we're looking for 75 airplanes at that point. And that's why as time goes by it gets more challenging for us. So having said all that no matter what we're still going to have a solid quarter. We'll have a solid profit. We will publish a schedule that we're proud of in the sense that Mike can operate it. It'll be well staffed et cetera, et cetera. It just won't be tuned and operated or optimized rather like it normally is. Tom?","Tom Nealon ","Well, yes. I just want to add to that. I think your -- part of your question was so how are you going unwind this not just financially but from the quality of the schedule perspective? I think that's how I interpret it. Obviously, when I get the customers we need to -- we're going to need to be in that kind of thing. But we weren't thinking about it as to -- and on to Gary's comments where we had to take a shorter-term view perhaps with some routes that have lower RASM performance as well as routes that are poor CASM performers.","And the way we're working through it in our network team is just -- as Gary said, we haven't got through this manually. There's not a process to do this on this kind of scale. So we've had to pare back some of our long-haul routes that are underperforming against the average.","There are also routes that were -- long-haul routes where there are alternative options. We can pare those back. And we're also reducing some of the international frequencies. So we're being very opportunistic. We happen to look at it line by line and that's how we're doing it. But it's about profitability. It's about getting our customers where they needed to be.","But to Gary's point about the unsung heroes that's the network planning role right now and they are the heroes. That's what they're doing. So...","Gary Kelly","Tammy anything you want to clean up there?","Tammy Romo","No. I don't think there is much to add to all of that. All of that -- just in terms of what we're expecting for capacity just to maybe, put a bow around all of that. And again we're obviously still working through all of this as we sit here today. But we did give you our full year ASM guidance of down 1% to 2% year-over-year.","So just backing into that it does imply exactly as you're coming up with there Duane that we'd be maybe down a little bit maybe down a point or so for our fourth quarter. But again a lot of moving parts and I will firm up any of that guidance as we go here.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Great. Thanks for that generous answer. And then just real quick on the follow-up, really appreciate all the moving parts on 2020 outcomes and appreciate your commentary about that you want to make up, in any lost ground that you gave up this year.","But based on your current knowledge of the approvals, based on your current knowledge of Boeing's ability to deliver, do you really think you'll end next year at that same shell count you expected to end 2020 before this MAX grounding?","Gary Kelly","Well, based on what we know today, we're aware that six deliveries, Tammy would slip into 2021. So just trying to take your question literally here. And yes, it'll be less than what we thought.","But I think - I'm fine with that. That's plenty close enough. And as everybody is aware, we're talking about putting a lot of airplanes into service next year. So if six slipped out of 2020 into 2021 from that perspective, that's fine as well. It's not going to make a huge difference.","I think what's more in play again is, whether we want to try to accelerate some retirements. And there's just work to be done there and our teams do a tail-by-tail analysis to see what maintenance cost could be avoided and whether that's sensible and whether it really is profit-accretive to try to do that. There's just a lot that goes into that.","Our staffing plan for next year looks really good Mike. So we haven't slowed our hiring such that we have a real snapback next year to catch up. So that's another I guess a fancy way of saying, we're a bit overstaffed. I don't think it's unproductive. But we have had to defer a couple of flight attendant and pilot classes as you pointed out earlier into next year.","So all the way around, again, I think we're set up very well. We can manage this. We're getting good at it. So hopefully it will \u2013 hopefully, we'll hit the assumed timeline that we shared with you. And I think if that's the case, we'll be reasonably back in-line with where we should have been by midyear, if not earlier. So we could potentially recover quickly which will be very welcome.","Tammy Romo","Yes. Just to add on to what Gary had said and we've talked about this a lot, we have tremendous flexibility in our fleet plan. So we'll work through this and obviously with the goal to produce financial results that we'll all be proud of and do it in a way that takes care of our customers.","So we -- as Gary said, we're working through our retirement plan, but we've got a lot of flexibility there. And so we'll work through all that. And I think you'll be really proud of the results when it's all said and done.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you very much.","Operator","All right. We have time for one more analyst question. We'll take that last question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks for squeezing me in. Gary and Mike a question for you on the obvious with the MAX. Can you talk about the plan to make sure you get confidence from passengers in terms of flying the plane and how you're going to tackle that if you don't have the load factors and yields that are suffering in the first couple of months?","And then relating to that, can you talk about any dialogue that you're having with the FAA? And any color about whether you sense urgency on their part to sort of move this along, given some of the pressures that you're obviously highlighting?","Gary Kelly","Well, why don't I take them in reverse. And Tom if you want you can talk about the reintroduction. So -- and Mike can you help me out here on the FAA? Well, yes the answer on the FAA is yes. We have daily dialogue with the FAA.","And I think that the FAA is -- well these are Gary's words. I believe that the work of Boeing on MCAS is done and I believe that the FAA is signed off on it. Although they are -- they will clearly tell you that they're not going to sign off on the MAX 8 until it is \"all done\u201d. But I think the MCAS component is done.","I'll be shocked, if we learn anything different on that and I'd be disappointed to learn anything different. But I don't sense that the FAA is at all motivated to extend this grounding. I think they want to make sure that everything is covered, and they are doing their job quite frankly.","This other thing came up, and it is such a remote chance that anything would go wrong. But in this environment, no one wants that remote chance. So Boeing readily agreed with that. And we're fine with that as well, by the way. It's -- I wished we had known it sooner, so it could have been worked on sooner. And I will admit to those thoughts. But no, I think it's all set up very well. And so unless we learn something new, it feels like our assumed time line is a reasonable one. Anything you want to add there, Mike?","Mike Van de Ven","No, I think that's right. I think the FAA is just better focused on a high-quality review dotting their Is, crossing their Ts, making sure that they've addressed any type of unknown risk out there. And once they're comfortable with that, they will issue the guidance to go forward.","Gary Kelly","Tom, you want to talk about the reintroduction?","Tom Nealon","Yeah. I think -- so I think Rajeev, there's just so much media on the topic. I think it's going to increase as the aircraft begins to be reintroduced to service, and I think there are certainly going to be some people, who book away from the MAX for some period of time. I think it's going to be the less than we might expect, maybe shorter duration than we expect. And I think we've done a pretty good job honestly of understanding where not just our customer, but even non-Southwest customers' heads are at with respect to the MAX aircraft and their intent to fly in all of those kind of things.","And what's really interesting is our customers -- so there's different ways to break all this to vapour. We're spending a lot of time actually with cohort customers. And our customers' perception of Southwest has not changed one iota, not at all in terms of their intent to fly, their trust in Southwest, the confidence they have in Southwest, et cetera, et cetera. So, obviously based all that, we're working through a very robust -- part of our return-to-service plan if you will.","I mean there's a big piece for Mike in the operational side. There's a big piece for the commercial side, and there's a big piece for marketing and communication in terms of how we want to communicate. And we're going through that. It's going to be a very robust plan. I think one of the questions that's -- I've been asked several times is what if a customer doesn't want to fly, are you going to be flexible? And obviously, yeah, we're going to be flexible if the customer has an issue flying on a MAX initially.","And to be honest with you, we have customers change flights all the time, so it's not a big change for us. In fact, I'm not sure what percent, but a massive percent of our itinerary has changed. So that's not a big deal for us. I think that we're just going to have to be flexible for a while as our customers get comfortable, and those that aren't. But we're very aware of it. We're thinking through it all, and I feel pretty confident where we are.","Gary Kelly","Yeah. And I do too. And we're going to have to have a communications campaign. We're good at that. And just know that our pilots will play a key role in this communication. They're the ones obviously that have to be comfortable, and they're the ones that are credible. So, nobody in this company and especially our pilots is going to do anything that they deem to be unsafe. So then it's just a matter of convincing our constituents of that, and we're going to work hard to do that.","Rajeev Lalwani","I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Ryan Martinez","All right. Well, that does it for the analyst portion of the call. Thank you guys for joining us. And of course if you have follow-ups just give me a ring.","Operator","All right. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Laurie Barnett, Managing Director of Communications and Outreach.","Laurie Barnett","Thank you, Greg. I'd like to welcome members of the media to our call today. And before we begin taking questions, Greg, would you please give instructions on how everyone should queue up for a question?","Operator","Of course, Ma\u2019am. [Operator Instructions] And ladies and gentlemen thank you for waiting. We'll take our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","Hi. Thanks for calling on me. I just had two really quick questions. The first is Gary, in your earlier remarks you mentioned 20,000 cancellations. Are those all MAX cancellations? And over what time frame did those occur?","Gary Kelly","Mike, that was total. I think normally you'd have 3,000 cancellations. So to put it into perspective -- but I would attribute the vast majority of that excess to the MAX.","Mike Van de Ven","Yes. Mary, when we talk about the 20,000 cancellations, they really come into two forums, with the schedule out there to sell the MAX and we have change the schedule. So before we operated that schedule, we pulled a lot of flights. I don't know flights we pulled out we included in that 20,000 cancellation number.","And secondly, once we did operate the schedule, because we were so close into the booking curve and trying to re-accommodate as many customers as we could, we operated April and May without any spare aircraft, which I would attribute to the MAX.","Gary Kelly","Right.","Mike Van de Ven","And so, as you have weather events or unexpected maintenance events or hailstorms or other things like that, we just had no way to recover the airplanes and that drove the cancellations up also. So as Gary said, that was around 12,000, 11,000 \u2013 12,000 cancellations for the quarter just in the operations. And those numbers are normally under 3,000. So the vast majority of that 20,000 cancellation number is MAX-related.","Mary Schlangenstein","And that 20,000 is just for the second quarter?","Mike Van de Ven","That's right.","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay. Okay. My other question real quick was on the Newark gates. What happens to those? Are you able to sublease those gates to somebody else?","Gary Kelly","It's a month-to-month lease, so no.","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay. And are you re-leasing them from United?","Gary Kelly","I don't know. I don't think so. But it's -- No. No. It has to be -- yeah, it's with month-to-month and with the Port Authority. So\u2026","Mary Schlangenstein","With the -- okay, great. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Next from The Wall Street Journal, we have Alison Sider.","Alison Sider","Hi everyone.","Gary Kelly","Hi.","Alison Sider","My question is do you think -- do you feel that -- hi -- do you feel like Boeing misled or provided any incomplete information at Southwest about the MAX either about the -- disagree or it's about MCAS more broadly or about whether it was safe to fly after Lion Air or really anything else?","Gary Kelly","Well, I don't think there was any malintent at all. I think Alison, obviously, in hindsight, we wish that this never happened. We wish that all the things that are being done now were done then. And all the knowledge that we have now, yeah, we wish we had it then. So there were judgments made about the remoteness of the risk and I think that's why Boeing behaved the way they did.","Alison Sider","Got it. So you don't from your perspective see that there was anything criminal that happened?","Gary Kelly","No. No. Now -- and again I get asked about Boeing a lot. Boeing is a great company and Boeing is important to not just Southwest but our country. And they have a problem. They recognize the problem and I'm very confident they're focused on addressing the problem and taking care of their customers.","So it's a tough situation and I have no doubt that mistakes have been made. Some are harder for us to evaluate than others. But my focus at this point is to get the problem solved, get the MAX restored to service, have Boeing do its job in terms of establishing confidence with customers as in the flying public.","And, obviously, we just need to be comfortable that all the issues that have been raised have been adequately addressed. And I think that's where with what Mike was covering earlier we all want to see what the airworthiness directive provides for. We'll want to go through the training and we'll want to validate for ourselves that it all works as intended.","So -- but no they're a great company. They're great people to work with. This is a terrible situation and I hate that they're in it. And, obviously, there are many of us that have been affected not just Southwest. There are a lot of people that have been affected here. So we just -- we need to keep our eye on the ball and solve the problem and move forward.","Alison Sider","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And next we have Tracy Rucinski with Reuters.","Tracy Rucinski","Hi, good afternoon. You've said that you expect some of your MAX deliveries to slip into 2020. How confident are you that you will receive those planes when you need them given that planes are stacking up at Boeing facilities? And can you tell us a little bit more about the technical kits that Boeing is preparing to help that delivery process?","Gary Kelly","Mike, I'll let you talk on the latter. Well, we're sort of in a range of we're not confident to we're 100% confident. I don't know where to put a percentage on it. But no there's no way we could be 100% confident that we're going to hit our assumed time line. And this is new territory for Boeing to unground airplanes so we're not quite sure of that. Then we've got -- we have to support that with our own resources and so does the FAA.","So, yeah, all that has to be estimated at this point and with a view towards we're going to have to be flexible. So we'll learn as we go I'm sure and I would assume that we'll get better at it as we start ungrounding the airplanes and that maybe it will accelerate. But no I mean there's \u2013 yeah, there's a lot of uncertainties surrounding exactly what that will look like when it starts.","Michael Van de Ven","Yeah. So Tracy this is Mike. We have 41 airplanes on a delivery schedule to take in 2019. And just my preference is -- and so if they made all those airplanes and they put them in a Boeing storage facility that just increases a pile of 700-ish airplanes out there. And to get those out of storage we have -- we're part of the bigger economy.","So it makes sense to us to have some of those airplanes rescheduled into 2020 where we can take them right off of production line in a normal course of business. That would give us more certainty and less complexity.","As to the airplanes that are coming out of storage what I understand is that most of the fixes at least at this point are software upgrades to the airplane. So there will be a service bulletin that will come out from Boeing that the FAA will mandate as an airworthiness directive. And then we will take that requirement and we will perform hopefully a software upgrade to the airplane. That is not complicated to do. There might be other work that we may need to do. And if we will we will do those things also.","And then as I mentioned earlier there's a second piece in terms of the airworthiness directive, which will be associated with pilot training. And so long as it is -- does not require simulator time, we will get our pilots through that training in 30 days.","Tracy Rucinski","Okay, thanks. So the technical kits, are those related to the software upgrade?","Michael Van de Ven","I'm not for sure what the technical kits are right now because I don't know what the final fix is going to be for the airplane.","Gary Kelly","But at least my interpretation of your question is what Mike is describing as a software is the technical package. So I don't know what else -- I'm with Mike. I don't know what else it would be. So all we know\u2026","Tracy Rucinski","Okay.","Mike Van de Ven","So all we know is that we're going to update the MCAS software and then the software this piece of firmware in the flight control system. And then, the only thing I want to make -- yeah I don't know if you heard our earlier analyst call.","But the simulator training, we don't feel is necessary because our pilots are extensively trained in the simulator, and for the kinds of scenarios that this software is being modified for.","So, there will be training, but we think that it can be done on a computer-based approach. And that's what the FAA seems to be leaning towards anyway. But we're comfortable with that.","Operator","Next from the Associated Press, we have David Koenig.","David Koenig","Hi. This is really quick for Gary. Just to clarify, I think it was the last question on the analyst portion, that FAA you said that FAA is reviewing MCAS and signed off on it. And all that got left to check is that issue that came up last month.","I wasn't clear did you hear that from Boeing? Or did you hear that from the FAA?","Gary Kelly","And David that's not exactly what I said. So, those \u2026","David Koenig","Okay.","Gary Kelly","\u2026were Gary's words. That's not the FAA telling --they in fact will not tell us, whether they have quality \u2026","David Koenig","Yeah.","Gary Kelly","\u2026\"signed off\" on MCAS, because they want it all comprehensively together and I don't blame them. I think all I was saying is that, based on the status reports that we've gotten from Boeing and from the FAA on where they stand.","I don't think that there is any more work to be done by either the Boeing or the FAA on that piece. I'm not speaking for them. I'm just telling you that we're not getting any sense that there's any more continuing on those functions by either Boeing or the FAA.","What is still now in suspense is Boeing has gone off to work on this second issue. And until they get that done, we're all sitting here waiting for that construction to be completed. And then, I suppose they'll show it to us and they'll show it to the FAA and we'll know more. But I'm not expecting any activity on that with us until September.","David Koenig","Okay. All right, so you don't want to explain where you got that sense but that that's your reading of the situation?","Gary Kelly","Well I thought I did yeah. But based on\u2026","David Koenig","Okay.","Gary Kelly","\u2026 the discussions that we've had with Boeing\u2026","David Koenig","Okay. All right.","Gary Kelly","\u2026 and the FAA they've implied that if you will.","David Koenig","Okay.","Gary Kelly","So -- but they're -- but I've asked them if they would separate it. And they told me \"We will not.\" So, I want to be -- I hopefully made that clear. No. They won't tell us officially that they have signed off.","And like I said, I don't blame them. They want to get the rest of it done and see it all together and make sure all those systems work as planned. But the good news is it's our sense that all of that work is in fact done and we're just waiting on the second piece.","David Koenig","Okay. Thank you for clarifying that.","Operator","All right and we have time for one more question. And we'll take that final question from Allison Schaefers with the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.","Allison Schaefers","Hello, all of you?","Gary Kelly","Hello.","Mike Van de Ven","Hello.","Allison Schaefers","I just wanted to see if you could be a little bit more specific about when you anticipate selling flights for Southwest Hawaii service for previously announced San Diego or Sacramento, Lihue and Hilo routes?","And is actual service on those as expected to start this year or not likely end of 2020 based on the ramp up time needed?","Gary Kelly","Well I should try I guess to disclose our schedule intent. I think I'm not going to do that today.","Mike Van de Ven","But thank you for ...","Gary Kelly","But we're really excited and we're very -- we're really making some announcements soon. And I will tell you that all the things we said previously, we still mean right? So, we still intend to serve Hawaii from Sacramento and San Diego and we still intend to serve Kona and Lihue.","And we still intend to have interisland between Hilo and the other islands. So, everything we said is still spot on. So, we just have a little more work to do still and we're working on our schedules right now. We're not ready to announce it. But we can't wait to begin those flights as well.","So -- and I'll tell you the reception we've had from the local communities has been phenomenal. And we could not be more excited as you heard from our very robust aloha when you said that. So thanks.","Allison Schaefers","Okay. Any way you can elaborate a little bit with some specifics on the demand that you've seen for Hawaii?","Gary Kelly","Well, I don't have any at my fingertips. I don't have any specific demand numbers. What I can tell you is that, as I said in my comments earlier, the load factors are significantly higher than what we're experiencing across the system.","And keep in mind we just announced record load factors for the entire company and our Hawaii business is surpassing that. In terms of actual demand I kind of think about it in terms of load and it's just phenomenal.","And that's a true for interisland as well as for the California to the islands routes. So, as I said, we have six mainland, California to the islands and we have eight round trips and it's just -- it's going phenomenally. It really is. So...","Allison Schaefers","Okay, thank you, gentlemen.","Gary Kelly","Thank you.","Mike Van de Ven","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Barnett for any additional or closing remarks.","Laurie Barnett","Thank you. If you all have any other questions our communications group is standing by to assist at 214-792-4847. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining."],"19632":["Southwest Airlines Co.

My name is Cody, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be made available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Martinez","Thank you, Cody, and welcome, everyone. Joining me on the call today, we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other members of our senior leadership team.","Please note that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, and these are based on our current intent, expectations and projections. As we noted in our earnings release this morning, we have made flight schedule adjustments through August 5 as a result of the MAX groundings. And the guidance we will provide today is based on our estimates assuming the grounding of the MAX through August 5.","A variety of factors, in particular those that are out of our control in connection with the MAX groundings, could cause our actual results to be materially different from our current guidance. We'll also make references to non-GAAP results, which exclude special items. And for more information regarding forward-looking statements and our reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP results, please visit the Investor Relations section of southwest.com.","So with that intro, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Kelly","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2019 earnings call. Overall, I am as proud as I have ever been of our people. They did an extraordinary job, produced solid results among industry-leading margins and despite the challenges of near-record cancellations. But for the numerous cancellation events, it would have been a blowout quarter. But still, rock-solid margins, returns and cash flows, and a huge thank-you to our people for their resilience and for their perseverance.","Based on where we are today and what we can see from today, the second quarter will be better. We're better prepared to handle the MAX schedule changes, prospectively through August 5, rather than the more chaotic daily cancellations. And our goal is to provide our customers a stellar experience during the busy summer, especially.","Our on-time performance was solid in the first quarter, and it will be solid again here in the second quarter. Restoring the MAX to service as soon as it's ready is also a priority, of course. And assuming that happens within the next couple of months, we'll get back on our delivery schedule and our capacity plan.","Mike, Tom and Tammy have prepared excellent briefings on our operations, commercial, and financial performances and expectations, and I don't want to steal their thunder, so I'm going to be brief this morning. But I did want to reiterate a couple of points.","Despite the challenging year so far, first of all, we were once again named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. This year, ranked number 11. We were just ranked number 2 out of 500 companies on Forbes List of Best Employers. And all great companies start and end with having great people and being a great employer. So we're very proud of that.","We were number 1 in the DOT rankings for 2018, Customer Satisfaction, again. And we're off to a great start in 2019. Our brand and NPS scores remain strong in 2019 and industry-leading as well. We have a balance sheet leverage of less than 28%. We have almost $3.9 billion in cash. We have an excellent, cost-effective and risk off fuel hedge in place for the next several years. Our Hawaii expansion is off to an exceptional start, and of course, that is despite having numerous distractions in the first quarter.","Our technology plans for this year and next are ambitious, but they are proceeding well and on track. And then, finally, I expect us to make progress on our cost initiatives this year except for the capacity cuts effect, of course. And we're not giving up on our goal to expand margins and return on capital year-over-year.","Despite the challenges, we may very well set records in some financial categories this year. But having said that, I admit that there's uncertainty surrounding a lot of things, certainly the timing of the MAX and, as usual, the economy and fuel prices.","But, we're off to a good start. And we're planning on having a good year and making a lot of progress this year. So with that very quick overview, let me turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Mike Van de Ven. Mike?","Mike Van de Ven","Well, thanks, Gary. The first quarter reinforced a couple things that I already know. Most important being that our people will absolutely rise to meet any challenge. And we had our fair share of challenges to start the year. The prevalent operational themes for the first quarter were launching our Hawaii service, and then, of course, the unanticipated maintenance rise up and our MAX groundings have impacted our operations.","So, as you all will remember, the quarter started the minute the government shutdown in the middle of our ETOPS authorization. We had worked on some contingency plans, and despite losing about a month of timing, were still able to launch Oakland to Honolulu service in the first quarter as planned. And since then, we've added an Oakland to Maui, and we're going to launch service between Maui and Honolulu on Sunday. The service startup went extremely well. Our onboard experience has received high customer marks, and we are continuing to add service during the second quarter.","Beginning in mid-February, we started to experience disruptions to the operations with unexpected maintenance write-ups. And just as that was returning to normal levels in mid-March, the MAX groundings occurred. Those combined items created unexpected, irregular operations to the last half of the quarter. So we were operating in a daily environment that consisted of canceled and delayed flights, aircraft swaps, crew reroutes, high volumes to our call centers, maintenance demand and logistics associated with the grounding and, of course, the customer anxiety at the airports. But our people, across the board, again, rose to the occasion and they took superb care of our customers and produced a very solid operational performance in spite of that environment.","Our on-time performance for the quarter was 78.7, and that was just a tad lower than last year's 79.3. And if we adjusted for the maintenance and the MAX impacts, our on-time performance would have modeled in the 83% range, and that would have put us second in the industry from a marketing carriers perspective. That's a good indication that the network design and our operational approach are in sync and we have a strong operational foundation as we move forward. Southwest had the top ranking for fewest customer complaints for domestic marketing carriers in 2018, as measured by the DOT. And as Gary mentioned, we maintained that position in both January and February, which are the latest results. And again, that's just additional evidence that our people are really leaning in to providing great hospitality and service to all of our customers. And our people have really owned the disruptions that these issues have caused our customers.","Cumulatively, the weather and the maintenance write-ups and the MAX groundings, they caused significant cancellations. We canceled more than 10,000 flights during the quarter, roughly 4% of our published schedule. That was significantly more than we would have expected going into the quarter and, in fact, that's the highest level of cancellations since the third quarter of 2001, which was impacted by 9\/11. Of course, we got much higher load factors and fewer seats to reaccommodate impacted customers today. But over the years, we've made significant investments in several operational recovery tools that minimize the impact on our customers for those issues.","So, in the first quarter environment, 97.5% of our customers got to their destinations the same day as scheduled. And that's compared to 97.8% last year when these issues didn't exist. So a very solid, very customer-service-driven result, given the unexpected challenges.","Turning to the MAX. We have 34 MAX aircraft grounded, 33 of them are in Victorville, California. We still have the one aircraft in Orlando that had the engine issue during the ferry flight. We're in the process of doing an engine change on that aircraft. It will be ferried to Victorville sometime over the next week. Having all the airplanes in one place improves the efficiency of our maintenance program for the aircraft as well as relaunching the fleet when we're able to do so. We're using this additional downtime to do any necessary inspections or planned work so that when the fleet can be relaunched, it's as close to being a new delivery aircraft from a maintenance perspective as possible.","Getting all 34 aircraft to relaunch and back in service is expected to take a month or so. We're still working on those detailed plans. The aircraft will need software upgrades as well as make-ready-to-fly work, and that includes things like unsealing the aircraft, oil and fluid checks, required inspections, system checks, cabin cleaning, those types of things. Of course, there will also be additional FAA pilot training requirements that will also need to be completed.","As Gary and Ryan mentioned, we've removed the airplane from our scheduled service through August 5. Assuming that the airplanes are cleared to fly before then, we'll pragmatically bring them back into our operational fleet and will utilize them as spares to support the network. They will begin to fly in a normal scheduled service pattern beginning August 6. And of course, if the groundings continue past that date, we'll need to make further adjustment to the schedule.","So, as we move into the second quarter, our operational theme is to provide an exceptional customer experience over the summer. Our unexpected maintenance events are behind us since we agreed to the tentative agreement with AMFA. AMFA's in the process of educating our mechanics on the agreement. We expect the voting results in the second half of May.","The MAX flights have been pulled out of our schedules and all impacted customers have been contacted, and are in the process of being reaccommodated. And given the related capacity pull down, we are left across the busy summer travel period so that we can provide exceptional service. We're focused on getting our customers the safe, reliable, on-time and fun experience that they're accustomed to on Southwest.","And so with that, I will turn it over to Tom.","Tom Nealon","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","So, as you all know, we finished 2018 very strong. We came into 2019 with a lot of momentum. And I think that despite several significant challenges, we have delivered a very strong revenue performance going into -- in the first quarter. In fact, we achieved record first quarter operating revenues of $5.1 billion and our year-over-year unit revenue performance is expected to be among the top in the industry.","And just to add on to what Gary said, the people of Southwest Airlines, they carried the day throughout the quarter under very, very tough circumstances. We had a lot of cancellations, a lot of reaccoms, and they serve our customers with the hospitality and the kindness that we are famous for. So it's been a challenging quarter, and you all did an incredible job.","In our March 27 investor update, we shared the details behind the drivers of our revised Q1 RASM forecast, which we said would be up 2% to 3% year-over-year. And we ended the first quarter at the high end of that guidance, with RASM growth of 2.7%. So let me start the quick recap of Q1, and then I'll cover our outlook for the second quarter.","So, in January, we were expecting Q1 RASM to increase in the range of 4% to 5%. And just as a reminder, there were several key factors that went into that original guidance: first, a continuation of the strength in the base business trends that we experienced in Q3 and Q4 of 2018; second, the benefit from November's system-wide fare increase; third, continued strong performance from our Rapid Rewards program; fourth, 1.5 points year-over-year RASM benefit from our new res system; and finally, a 1.5 RASM tailwind from Q1 2018's suboptimal flight schedule. We also planned for a roughly $40 million shift in the revenue from Q1 to Q2 due to the Easter shift. And we also plan to grow our Q1 capacity by approximately 3.5% to 4%. So that's what the plan was based on. Let me quickly recap what's occurred since our earnings call in January.","So first, as we shared previously, we quantified the impact of the government shutdown to be roughly $60 million. And obviously, government-related business travel was the most easily identified. But we also began to see a clear trend change and leisure demand softened with the prolonged shutdown. And this continued pretty much throughout the quarter. Versus our original Q1 RASM expectation of plus 4% to 5%, the shutdown impact is what caused us to revise our Q1 RASM guidance down a full point to plus 3% to 4%.","Second, the unscheduled maintenance events was another large contributor, resulting in a little more than 0.5 points reduction to Q1 RASM. And this essentially lasted from mid-February through mid-March. Third, the March 13 grounding of our MAX fleet was the next largest revenue drag. It was a slight benefit, actually, to our Q1 RASM. And fourth, softness and leisure demand in yields, which is really related to the government shutdown, was approximately 0.5 points negative impact to Q1 RASM. I think it's important to call out right now that this trend has changed and we're seeing leisure demand and yield strength in the second quarter.","So, we ended the quarter with over $200 million off our original revenue forecast, and we ended the quarter about 2.5 points below our capacity plan. Now part of the RASM impact we saw, particularly in February and March, was due to having less inventory available for higher-yield close-in bookings. We had to use a lot of this close-in inventory to reaccommodate our customers due to the maintenance disruptions and the MAX grounding.","Now, in contrast to the unscheduled maintenance disruptions, which were very unpredictable day in, day out, and very difficult for our employees and our customers, we were much better able to get out in front of the MAX cancellations to minimize the impact to our customers. And we were much more proactive in reaccomodating our customers several days in advance of the flight date.","So having said all that, our close-in yields remained strong year-over-year. Business travel demand continued to be strong as well. But we took fewer close-in bookings simply because of the reduced inventory per sale.","Our revenue management capabilities continued to perform very well and drove a 1 point year-over-year RASM benefit in the quarter, which was slightly lower than our original expectation of 1.5 points. And this is due to the softer trends I just mentioned as well as the reduction in inventory. Our industry-leading Rapid Rewards program is performing extremely well and is continuing to grow double digits, both in terms of the size of the customer portfolio as well as in terms of the total loyalty revenue.","We are continuing to see tremendous strength across every metric of Rapid Rewards, and this was on an already strong base. In Q1, we saw record acquisitions in new Rapid Rewards members. We also saw our highest ever acquisition of new co-brand credit card holders. And we're also seeing very high retention rates, which is a great combination. So again, our Rapid Rewards program continues to perform extremely well. Our customers love the benefits and the value of the program, and there is a lot of runway in front of us for continued growth.","In terms of our ancillary products, they also contribute to the first quarter's RASM performance, also with strong double-digit performance in our boarding products, including continued strength in the variable pricing of our EarlyBird product that we implemented last fall. That pricing structure is working very well and it's meeting all of our expectations.","I think EarlyBird also benefited from our improved merchandising capabilities on Southwest.com. And we will continue to invest our industry-leading, direct-to-consumer Southwest.com platform. Our international markets are also doing very well and continue to develop and mature. Though this is only 4% of our system capacity, we are really pleased with the performance that we're seeing. RASM, yields, load factors are all strengthening, and our international business is developing as planned. And we're also seeing noteworthy performance in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.","Finally, we launched our service to Hawaii on March 17. We began our initial flights by connecting Oakland to Honolulu and Maui. And as you know, we began our Hawaii flights with very low initial pricing. And if you look at where we are today, we are moving up the pricing ladder to what we consider to be normal pricing levels, and we're seeing very strong demand in bookings.","And while it's a small sample set, the early feedback from our customers, as Mike alluded to, is absolutely exceptional, and their satisfaction with the in-flight experience is actually higher than the rest of our system, which, as you know, has always had extremely high Net Promoter Score.","I think this clearly speaks to the strength and the quality of our economy product, and not just on short- and medium-haul trips, but on long-haul trips as well.","So, in summary, for Q1, a lot has happened over the past 3 months. Several things have happened that we certainly did not anticipate, but a lot of things also happened that we did expect. We saw a 1.5 point year-over-year tailwind in the Q1 2018 suboptimal schedule. We saw a continuation of strong year-over-year close-in yields. We saw another very strong performance from Rapid Rewards, and we saw a healthy year-over-year RASM benefit from our revenue management enhancements. And just as a footnote, this our highest year-over-year quarterly RASM since the third quarter of 2014. So that's it for Q1.","Now, let's talk about the second quarter. So we are expecting strong year-over-year Q2 RASM performance in the range of up 5.5% to 7.5%. And this is based on the current booking curves and pricing trends that we're seeing. This is a strong year-over-year improvement as well as compared with Q1. And recent demand and yield trends have stabilized and are improving.","Earlier this month, as you know, we republished our schedule for April 7 through August 5, and the intent was very simple, to get us back to a schedule that we knew we could fly with the 700s and 800s that were in our fleet. As we removed MAX flight from the schedule, we're doing it in a way that maintains the integrity of our network and the strength of our schedule. And until the MAX is back in service, we intend to operate a slightly reduced schedule, but with the reliability and the hospitality that we're famous for. It's a better and more efficient way to run the operation, and that's what our employees and our customers need from us.","Now, keep in mind that because of the MAX grounding, we'll have less close-in seat inventory just because we're having to reaccommodate impacted customers on new itineraries, which by definition is being done with close-in seat inventory. So this will have an impact on close-in, higher-yield April bookings. We saw improvements in bookings in yields for Easter, and we're also seeing improvement in both May and June. The demand that we're seeing is solid for both leisure and business travel, and close-in fares are holding up very nicely, and we're seeing a continuation of strength in close-in yields year-over-year.","So, the bottom line is that we're encouraged by the improvements that we're seeing in Q2. And just as a reminder, we had a 3 point RASM headwind in Q2 of 2018 and 2 things drove this.","First, we had the 1-point impact from the suboptimal flight schedule and, second, we had a 2-point impact following Flight 1380. So this equates to a 3 point RASM tailwind for Q2 2019. We also had a 0.5 points year-over-year RASM benefit due to the Easter shift into Q2.","So, similar to the first quarter, we expect around 1 point in year-over-year RASM benefit in Q2 from our reservation system, and this is in comparison to roughly 0.5 points of RASM benefit in Q2 of last year. And we expect about a 1-point RASM benefit in Q2 due to lower capacity as a result of the MAX groundings. And finally, we expect another strong performance from our Rapid Rewards program in the second quarter as well as continued strength and growth in our ancillary revenues.","As we said, Hawaii is off to a great start. It has exceeded our expectations in March, due to the overwhelming demand in our initial flights. And despite a very short 2-week booking window, our first flights sold out very quickly. In fact, initial flights were sold out before we were even able to get the first e-mail out to Rapid Reward members.","So, this coming Sunday, we'll continue. We'll begin in and around service between Honolulu and Maui, and we'll connect Honolulu and Kona on May 12. On May 5, we'll launch service from our second California gateway, San Jose, to Honolulu, and on May 26, we'll connect San Jose to Maui. We have more Hawaii service to come, and we are very pleased with how these markets are performing. And the expansion of Southwest service into Hawaii is our primary route development focus for 2019 to 2020. And that will also include more inter-island service.","So, to wrap it up, first quarter was challenging across many fronts, certainly for revenue. And I am very proud of our people and I'm very proud of our first quarter results. And we are off to a solidly positive RASM performance for the year. Our goal to grow 2019 RASM in excess of 3% year-over-year has not changed. We're dealing with some unforeseen circumstances, but we are focused on those things that we can control. The strength of the Southwest brand remains very high. Our customer service and our brand NPS scores continue to be at the very top, the very top of the industry. We're continuing to grow our customer base, in particular, our most valuable customer segments, as well as in key markets.","So, we have a lot of momentum coming out of Q1 and our immediate focus is on solid execution in Q2. And just like in Q1, our outlook for Q2 RASM should be at or near the very top of the industry again.","So, with that, let me turn it over to Tammy to take us through the financials.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Tom. And hello, everyone. Gary, Mike and Tom have outlined the challenges that we've been managing through since the beginning of the year, and I'd like to add my thanks to all of our hardworking employees for their resilient focus today good care of our customers and for their unwavering commitment to Southwest.","Despite the significant headwinds, we are off to a solid start to the year, with almost a 10% pretax margin, and we continue to consistently generate strong cash flows and shareholder returns. I want to also thank our people for their focus on cost control in the midst of all the challenges. Our first quarter nominal cost, excluding fuel and profit sharing, were relatively in line with where we expected them to be at the beginning of the quarter, despite the numerous headwinds. On a unit basis, ex fuel, special items and profit sharing, our cost increased 8.1% year-over-year. Relative to the approximately 6% we were expecting back in January, there were 2 primary drivers of the higher year-over-year growth.","First, the flight cancellations that we experienced reduced our available seat mile growth in first quarter by about 2.5 points year-over-year. And combined with additional cost pressures from maintenance-related disruptions and weather increased our CASM-Ex by about 3 points, since we didn't have opportunities to shed costs that were predominantly fixed at close-in.","Second, we had a $30 million increase to salary, wages and benefits due to our tentative agreement with AMFA, which represents a higher compensation for our mechanics compared with the previously rejected TA from last fall. This created another point of year-over-year CASM-Ex increase in first quarter. This 4-point negative CASM-Ex impact was offset by about 2 points due to better-than-expected completion factor, employee productivity and health care trends, as well as the shifting of advertising and airport costs out of first quarter and into future quarters this year. This resulted in an 8.1% increase in our first quarter CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing year-over-year.","So, to recap, if you exclude the impacts from the unexpected events, first quarter 2019 CASM-Ex growth would have been in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year. Looking to second quarter, our expectations back in January were for year-over-year cost inflation ex fuel and profit sharing in the 6% range similar to our initial first quarter estimates. As a reminder, the key drivers of our initial expectations were the underutilization of our fleet in first half 2019 due to the delay in our service to Hawaii and the resulting onetime startup cost; higher airport, labor and ownership costs; as well as the timing of maintenance events and technology investments. While those drivers are still relevant, the reduced capacity from our MAX grounding for second quarter is now driving an additional 5 points of inflationary pressure, net of some flight crew and landing fee efficiencies from proactive flight cancellations beginning in early April versus our immediate cancellations in March. And we have about 0.5 points negative impact from advertising and airport cost shifting from first quarter.","As a result, we now expect second quarter CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing, to increase in the 10.5% to 12.5% range year-over-year. Looking to the back half of this year, we initially expected flat CASM-Ex. With our MAX groundings extended through August 5, we now estimate about 3 points of incremental unit cost pressure in third quarter 2019 based on flight cancellations to date. And while we hope this doesn't persist any longer, there is still uncertainty around the timing of the MAX returning to service. That said, based on what we know today, we continue to expect sequential improvement in the year-over-year CASM-Ex fuel and profit sharing from second to third to fourth quarter.","For full-year 2019 costs, under the assumption that MAX groundings do not extend beyond August 5, we currently estimate CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing, will increase in the 5.5% to 6.5% range year-over-year. This includes about a 2-point headwind from lower capacity as a result of the MAX groundings and 0.5 points of headwind due to the TA with AMFA. Of course, I will keep you updated as we learn more.","Moving on to fuel. Fuel prices have increased since the beginning of the year with fixed Brent crude up 25% in first quarter since January 1. Also, our fuel efficiency improvement has been impacted by the MAX grounding. That said, our first quarter economic fuel price was in line with our most recent guidance, at $2.05 per gallon.","We have great fuel-hedging protection in place this year with 78% hedge in second quarter and 60% to 65% hedge in the second half of the year. Our hedging premiums for this year remain at approximately $95 million or about $0.04 per gallon. Our 2019 hedging protection produces modest gains at current market prices and kicks in more materially at a 75 Brent crude equivalent. So we are very well-prepared should we continue to see rising energy prices. And as a reminder, our 2019 hedges are a mix of WTI and Brent crude. Our hedging portfolio continues to be structured so that we fully participate in any market declines. For second quarter 2019 and full year 2019, based on market prices as of April 18 and given our current hedge, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.10 to $2.20 range. Fuel efficiency improved a modest 0.5% at first quarter, which was understandably lower than expected with the grounding of our 34 most fuel-efficient MAX aircraft in mid-March.","Also, heavy winter weather also drove a higher fuel consumption than we had planned. Second quarter fuel efficiency is expected to be flat to down 1% year-over-year as the MAX has been removed from the entire second quarter flight schedule. For the full year, 2019 fuel efficiency is now expected to be flat to up 1% year-over-year. That said, fuel efficiency improvement remains a material part of our longer-term cost story once the MAX is back in service and more fuel-efficient aircraft will comprise a growing percentage of our total fleet.","Turning now to our industry-leading balance sheet. Our strong financial position earned us an upgrade to A- from Fitch during the quarter, which we are thrilled about. We ended the quarter with ample cash and short-term investments of $3.9 billion, with our $1 billion revolver fully available.","We adopted the new lease standard as of January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis. And as a result, the primary impact was to the balance sheet. We recognized a $1.5 billion operating lease right-of-use asset, which is primarily comprised of aircraft operating leases and airport operating leases and a corresponding liability.","We also removed $1.7 billion of assets constructed for others and the related construction obligation of $1.6 billion for completed airport terminal projects such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby and Fort Lauderdale. The net impact was approximately a $270 million reduction to the balance sheet. The impact to the income statement was immaterial. We have very manageable debt obligations and capital spending plans for 2019. And at this point, we continue to expect 2019 CapEx in the $1.9 billion to $2 billion range, based on the remaining Boeing deliveries scheduled for this year.","On non-aircraft CapEx, we continue to make significant investments in technology, and we are making good progress on a new maintenance system. Our significant airport investments in LAX, Kansas City, Baltimore, Nashville and Boston are under way, and progress is being made on our maintenance hangar investment in Houston, Phoenix and Denver. We expect our investments to help drive incremental revenue and productivity as well as support longer-term cost objectives and our growth plans.","We had strong cash flows in first quarter, allowing us to return $678 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Lastly, on fleet and capacity. We ended first quarter with 753 aircraft in our fleet, taking delivery of 3 leased MAX 8 aircraft so far this year. We are currently working through the delivery delays with Boeing, but we don't have any updates to share at this point.","Although our 41 remaining aircraft deliveries this year are on hold, the majority of them are back half loaded. As a reminder, we have 28 owned MAX aircraft from Boeing and 13 additional leased MAX aircraft in our order book for 2019. We are evaluating our fleet retirement plans, but at this point, we continue to expect to retire as many as 18 aircraft this year, but that will obviously be subject to the duration of the MAX groundings. Our retirements helped with our fleet modernization efforts, improving efficiency, reliability, fuel burn, and reducing our maintenance burden.","In second quarter, given MAX flight cancellations, we now expect capacity to be down in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. And for full year 2019, based on what we know to date, and given MAX flight cancellations through August 5, we now estimate our annual 2019 capacity will increase in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year.","Our schedule is currently published through early November, and that includes the first phase of our Hawaii plan, as Tom covered. And we'll evaluate further flight schedule revisions based on the duration of the MAX grounding.","So in closing and as a quick recap on what we shared today, despite the ongoing MAX groundings, our employees continued to rally and take great care of our customers. Our revenue management system is producing revenue gains and performing exactly as we expect it to, and we are expecting strong year-over-year RASM growth in second quarter.","We have a great fuel hedging protection for our 2019 and beyond in place to mitigate rising fuel prices. Flight cancellations and lower capacity is putting pressure on our nonfuel unit costs, though we continue to focus on strict cost control and being nimble. Based on what we know today, we continue to expect solid margins in 2019, with the opportunity to deliver stellar returns on capital. We continue to make important investments in our people, our fleet, the airports we serve and technology, which will support our scalability and many future growth opportunities, including Hawaii. Another huge thank-you to all of our employees who are managing through a lot and continue to do a terrific job.","With that, Cody, I'll turn it back to you now to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll begin with our first question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.","Jamie Baker","Gary, hypothetically, how many consecutive quarters of stagnation, from a capacity perspective, would you be willing to tolerate before possibly considering nonorganic growth opportunities?","Gary Kelly","Oh, wow. Well, we've been asked several variations of that question, although not that one exactly. And right now, I'll just ask our folks to stay focused. We have a very good plan for 2019. We're not at the point yet where we need to call any material audibles. We're working on -- the MAX is pretty much the audible that is tasking our group right now. I have not asked them to consider contingency Plan B, C, D, E or whatever it might be.","So, I just don't have a ready answer to that question. I think all of us are working under a reasonable assumption that the MAX is going to return to service in a reasonable amount of time. And then, whether we're back to normal, sometime during the third quarter or to begin the fourth quarter, in the grand scheme of things, is probably somewhat immaterial. I think what all of us are a little more concerned about is if that goes on too long, we have a -- Tammy referred to this, so we have a retirement program.","So, Jamie, I think what we would be -- what we would have to scratch our heads with more is just from an operational perspective, we've already planned retirements. And that would imply that capacity goes down from here. But we certainly don't want that. And it would be a lot of work for us to go in and unwind our retirement plan, and I do not want to do that. That would not be efficient. We've got better things to work on, quite frankly. You've asked a much broader, more strategic question. And that's a pretty -- that's an outlier in terms of a scenario. And I just don't -- I don't think that, that is anything that we'll be spending any time thinking about right now. But clearly, strategically, we're in a growth mode, so is the industry. We need to be growing. And we don't -- we -- clearly, we do not want this stagnation, to use your word, to continue very long. But I just don't have a ready answer on that question. And I don't think that, that is a likely scenario.","Jamie Baker","Yes. That's very helpful, Gary. No, I appreciate it. A quick follow-up. In the event that the FAA does not require any sim time, and it seems to be moving in that direction, but other regulatory agencies do or other pilot unions do, whether here or abroad, is this a scenario that you've discussed with SWAPA at all? I mean, is there a risk that even if the FAA goes with an iPad-training protocol, just the public scrutiny and\/or union pressures might lead you to nonetheless pursue sim-based training as a part of the return to service, because that would obviously slow the process down, possibly, quite a bit.","Gary Kelly","Well, again, just taking your question literally, which I think is the way you intend it, yes, I think that just getting pilots back into the simulator for an event would be a challenge, and that would take time. I think it just depends on what training one is talking about because our pilots are extensively trained. And again, I'm a layperson at this. But my own interpretation is that we already do the kind of training that one would be contemplating to put the MAX back into service. Mike, how many MAX simulators are there even in the world? So -- but the point is, managing the aircraft in a runway stabilizer scenario is something that we already train on and at least as best I can tell has already been covered. So again, I would just go back to we don't know what that would mean precisely. But at this point, we're not hearing that, that will be a requirement. I just go back to we are the most experienced 737 operator in the world. Our pilots are extensively trained. We don't hire them unless they have a tremendous amount of experience, Captain experience, for that matter. So regardless, we'll do whatever we have to do here, but we're obviously awaiting the Boeing service bulletin as well as the FAA or worthiness directive to know exactly what we'll have to do.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","So maybe I'm reading too much into this sentence. But the CapEx reiteration for this year has this clause of \"assuming no prolonged grounding of the MAX aircraft.\" So is that to suggest that you might not take delivery of aircraft that you're scheduled to in the back half if it's still grounded and that CapEx would actually come down?","Gary Kelly","No. I think that -- I'll just be explicit. We are not taking any deliveries right now and, therefore, we're not paying for anything. So if you just took your scenario, and we don't get any more MAXes delivered in 2019, our CapEx would be dramatically lower. But Boeing cannot deliver an airplane now. So any airplanes that they are manufacturing, again, just to be crystal clear, they're at Boeing Field. And so they are not being delivered and we're not paying for them. Did I get that right, Tammy? Tammy is the one who sends the money. So, I just think she...","Tammy Romo","We will be writing our check as they are delivered.","Gary Kelly","There you go. So hopefully, that answers your question.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then, just with respect to the longer-term cost profile. At the start out this year, obviously, there was some first half pressure. There's been a lot of noise and changes around this grounding. But you had talked about a flattening of the cost profile into 2020. Given the extra cost pressure that you're seeing this year, can you just update us on your thoughts of what the cost profile might look like into 2020?","Gary Kelly","Yes, sir. And Duane, that's what I was attempting to, at very high level, comment on in my remarks is that -- and Tammy mentioned this. So we're asking all of our departments to hit their budgets. And then, where they have activity-driven kinds of spending to obviously come in under their budgets. So we're not burning as much jet fuel, as one example. We're not incurring as many landings and takeoffs from a landing fees and rentals perspective. So to the extent that we have variable costs, we expect our departments to come in under. We have a series of cost initiatives to improve our efficiency. Those are continuing.","And let's just assume that the MAX is back in the fleet in the summertime. I would expect us to hit our cost plan for the fourth quarter, which would be pure. You'd have a -- we'd have our schedule restored. We'd have all of our fleet. And I would expect the cost comparisons year-over-year to be quite good. I think it's a little -- and Tammy and Ryan get this question a lot right now, just trying to project forward to 2020 and what will the costs look like. Again, under that same assumption that we've restored the flying of the MAX this year, we don't see any different cost performance for 2020 at this point. Obviously, the comps are going to be dependent upon what ultimately happens here in 2019. But the cost outlook should be unchanged, based on that report.","Tammy Romo","Yes. So, certainly, by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we would expect to be on a good trajectory assuming the MAX are back in service at that time. So completely agree.","Gary Kelly","Now if Jamie's question all of a sudden becomes more of an issue, there's extra training or the training delays the MAX flying or whatever it might be, you understand that I'm not incorporating those unexpected events into that kind of a comment. It's assuming that we're back up and running as per normal with that kind of an outlook.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Thanks for all the color on this call today. And just to follow up on that line of questioning from Duane, is it fair to assume that the underlying ASM production on your 2020 CASM will be whatever was in the baseline for last year plus whatever is taking out -- I'm sorry, for next year, whatever's taken out for the MAX this year? Meaning, like 4% or 5% baseline plus 2%, 2.5% for the MAX groundings? Is that a fair way to think about that as you're thinking about the CASM profile for next year?","Gary Kelly","Yes, sir. And, Hunter, the other -- we built the airline to support by year-end Ryan's 775 airplanes, then we've got another 25-ish coming in 2020. So yes, we want to get airplanes and we want to fly them. So the capacity that we're thinking of to begin this year for 2020, that's what I want us to fly. Now again, there's still questions about exactly how the MAX will re-enter service. But assuming everything comes back online and we're up and running, we get all the airplanes, as we have committed to Boeing and they've committed to us, then yes, we would be flying the 2020 plan as we started this year.","Hunter Keay","Okay, great. And then can you talk about the 800 in Hawaii and any maybe operational challenges that you've had with that plane? I know why you flew it there originally. It makes sense. But it's probably not the most ideally suited aircraft for doing that in the MAX. Any operational challenges that you've had there? And also if you could kind of elaborate on how you're cracking the distribution nut inter-island Hawaii, particularly within the local community there?","Gary Kelly","I'll ask Mike to speak to the operational aspect and Tom to talk about the distribution.","Mike Van de Ven","So yes, so we really aren't having any, what I would call, significant operational issues with the 800. We're very comfortable with the airplane. We knew, though, that given its range that we would -- we may have to put some lids on the seats, especially in -- when you're flying against some of those headwinds. So that's been the biggest operational challenge for us. We're scanning bags on there, the weight balance program works well. We've got it blocked pretty well. The station performance, we're fully staffed in the stations. The people out there are excited. They're turning the airplanes well. So we're just -- we're learning how to navigate through the Honolulu airport a little bit better and the taxi times on the ground there. But in terms of the operation, the maintenance and the support and the crews of the airplane, all going as planned.","Tom Nealon","Hunter, I think on the distribution side, we started service back in March. We've been on the ground in Hawaii for well over a year in terms of community outreach, community affairs. And so we've already got a pretty deep roots for such new operation, pretty deep roots in the Hawaiian community. And so in terms of distribution, it's what we always do at southwest.com. So they know the brand better than I would have expected, actually, because many people from Hawaii are traveling to the U.S -- or to the mainland rather, and they're flying Southwest. They know the brand. So a lot of local marketing, a lot of presence. And we're actually seeing very strong, very, very strong reception to the Southwest brand on-island. So that's probably how I'd best answer it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","First, just a clarification on the -- on some of the CASM questions from earlier. If capacity growth next year is going to end up being a lot higher simply because of the MAX timing, then shouldn't CASM actually be materially lower, say, flat to down versus that 1% to 2% or so that you were talking about before, Gary?","Gary Kelly","I don't think I quoted a number. Well, I know I didn't quote a number. So I think all I was trying to communicate at this point, and so this is April, so we've got a ways to go before we get into 2020. But whatever CASM we were expecting in 2020 before the events of this year, that's what I would be expecting next year. How that will compare to 2019, I don't think we're ready to say yet. Clearly, we're running higher on CASM here in the first half and that'll probably dribble into the third quarter. Well, it will because we've already reduced our flight schedule through August 5. So yes, you're going to have an easier comp because of all of this. But I don't think we are prepared today to give you any insight as to what that would be. If you thought it was up 1 to 2 before, yes, I agree. It's going to be something less than that, I just don't know how much less yet.","Tammy Romo","Yes, really nothing has changed from our last comment. So we're just setting aside all the noise from the unanticipated first quarter events, our long-term unit cost target remains unchanged. And so nothing -- no new update here today.","Gary Kelly","Yes. So what I meant earlier was just a nominal amount, not a year-over-year amount. So what else can we do for you?","Rajeev Lalwani","And then on the RASM side, Gary, I think you've laid out some objectives earlier in the year. There's been a lot that's moved around. Can you just refresh us on where you are with sort of hitting those targets and whether or not, and this may be for Tom, do you think you can keep some of the momentum that you're seeing in 2Q going into the back half of the year such that there's not this massive step down, if you will?","Gary Kelly","Well, let me offer a quick comment, and then I know Tom will want to chime in here. In his remarks, he said that our goal remains in excess of 3% unit revenue growth for the year 2019 versus year ago. What I was intending to also suggest with my remarks is that we began the year with the goal to improve margins. We got a little bit of help on that front with lower fuel prices. That still is the case as we look forward today. We've got lower year-over-year fuel prices. We're a little wobbly with our fuel consumption numbers because of the MAX benefit we were getting and now not. But except for that, the fuel outlook still looks, at this juncture, looks really good. So we had a desire to drive better operating margins, net margins and returns on invested capital. That's not happening here in the first quarter. But I wouldn't give up on that especially in the second half of the year and for the full year. So our folks are doing a good job managing their cost. First quarter was really ragged with operations incurring -- even though we had fewer flights, there was more cost for per flight because of dealing with all of the irregular operations, as we call them. So that should perform, Mike, I think a lot better here in the second quarter because, like you and Tom were saying, we've gotten ahead of that. It's just a much more orderly way to reschedule the airline that way. So, Tom, you want to talk about the RASM?","Tom Nealon","Yes, and I think I'd just kind of restate that the 3% objective is the flight we have in the ground. We're going for it. I think that's what we're seeing so far. The first quarter, as you guys know, was a very -- I think you keep hearing the word choppy. Every earnings call, I hear the word choppy. The first quarter was very, very choppy. And we're coming out of that and we're seeing really nice stabilization of trends. We're seeing normalization of the curves. We're seeing normalization of demand and the fare environment seems to be really where we need it to be. And I think that it's just a shame we have this MAX thing going on because it's a pretty good business environment. So our corporate travel, which is a really good indicator of just the economy, is robust. I wish we had more close-in inventory to sell, but we're re-accommodating. That's a pretty good indicator of this core economic strength, and the business climate or the business bookings are strong. Like I said, wish we had more to sell. But that's my commentary on that.","Gary Kelly","And I think that's excellent. And I -- the one thing that I wanted to be sure that all of you took away from today, I read all kinds of crazy things about the impact on our brand and our customers are mad and on and on. Our business is really good. And it's in -- it's because our employees work so hard to serve our customers so well. So there are -- while no doubt there are always impacts to companies' brands based on things that happen, our brand is unbelievably strong and I think well deserved. And the operation integrity is intact and looks really, really solid, and there is no evidence of any weakness that is unique to Southwest after our first quarter, and I think we're all very proud of that. And again, very proud of our people for making that happen.","Tammy Romo","And the only other point I would add on to that is the flexibility and the strength of our network is tremendous. And I think you are seeing that in our results as we work through all these cancellations. So I'd just put an exclamation point there. And then I would also just point out that we have a new reservation system, new revenue management tools, which are also helping us manage through all the challenges. So just the strengths of Southwest just really do go on and on.","Gary Kelly","And the network changes, I think as some of you all have recognized, they were just masterfully done. So while we had to trim some capacity out, it was done in a way that, again, that also maintained the integrity of our customer offering. I'm very, very proud of that.","Operator","We'll now move onto our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Gary, just to start off with you. It certainly sounds like Hawaii flying is off to a great start, both in terms of customer demand and also the experience. So now that you've got a couple of months under your belt in terms of booking trends, I'd just be curious to get your view on if the ramp time around those routes to get them towards system-level profitability has changed at all or if your sort of thoughts there have changed, given what you've experienced the last couple months.","Gary Kelly","Well, again, I'll let Tom speak to that, too. I'll just give you my opinion about that. First of all, we're very good at forecasting. And that market forecast, at least to me in my experience, surprisingly well. And I think a lot of that is due to the fact that we have such an immense customer base in California, which is what this is geared for. And number two, because Hawaii is such a terrific destination that is missing from our flight schedule. But I did -- we haven't talked about international. International is a bigger segment of our system than Hawaii is, of course. And our international segment is developing very, very nicely. I was very pleased at the performance here in the first quarter. And I just offer that up as a contrast. I think our opportunity in Hawaii is far greater and far easier than what we are tackling in international markets just because we don't necessarily have the same relative strengths. And we certainly don't have the awareness in our international destinations about Southwest that we do, as Tom mentioned on Hawaii. But I don't see, Tom, that it's -- I mean first of all, we've just gotten started, to be fair to the question. But I certainly don't see anything that would discourage us. In fact, the fact that, as you pointed out, the flights sold out before we even put out a press release, I was stunned. But what are your thoughts?","Tom Nealon","I think I've said this before, not sure I've said it on an earnings call, but we have such a built-in customer base in California wanting us to take them to Hawaii that I don't know how much faster than typically we should expect this to turn. I think this will develop faster than other new markets. You might have seen us do with international, where we don't have a built-in customer base. But I'm thrilled with where we are, but, yes, I did do some competitive shopping yesterday, just looking at the fares, and I really like where we are. I mean, we're very early into this and we're at pricing that is -- it's below the competition, but still it's good, solid, strong pricing. And not sure if you guys have taken a look at our pricing on dotcom versus our competition, but I love where we are very quickly in our development curve. So I think when you begin to add the bag fees, the first bag, second bag, third bag, there's a real dramatic difference. And we can make money at that price point because of our cost structure. And we feel great about it, this is kind of the Classic Southwest Effect. So I feel good about where we are, Jack.","Gary Kelly","And I do want to make sure that -- there was a question earlier, I just want to make sure that we were clear. And Mike commented on this. But we have 175 seats on these airplanes. We are not selling all 175, for operational reasons. And so that is -- and that was Mike's point earlier. So if you think about, in the context of your question, profitability, longer term, Mike, I think you would agree, the MAX will be the better airplane there. It just has better performance and better range characteristics. But even with that, I think we feel very good, and that's all factored into our modeling. And I just offer that up, Tom, because I think we have upside even to where we are today with the performance in those markets.","Tom Nealon","I would agree with that.","Jack Atkins","Well, that's great. And just for my follow-up, Gary, you alluded on the fourth quarter call to the potential for new revenue management levers that could be rolled out in 2020. And I know there have been a lot of things in terms of outside factors that have been taking up your bandwidth over the last few months. But is there anything you can update us on there in terms of the potential for revenue management opportunities as you look out into next year?","Gary Kelly","I would say in terms of the distractions, sort of the unplanned, I don't -- Tom, I don't think that has an impact on the work that we're doing on these couple of secret initiatives.","Tom Nealon","Nope. They're totally unconnected.","Gary Kelly","So, but I don't think, Tammy, do we have a news to share yet?","Tammy Romo","There is no news to share yet. So everyone's going to have to stay tuned there.","Gary Kelly","So stay tuned please, sir. And then begging for your patience there, so coming soon.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse.","Joe Caiado","Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll keep them short. Mike, I think you said it would take about a month once the grounding order is rescinded to get your 34 aircraft back into service; a number of things would have to happen there first. It sounds like there's some incremental costs associated with those preparations. So for you and Tammy, are those already embedded in your revised full year CASM-Ex guidance? Or are you not going to be picking up the tab on that and so, therefore, it is not included?","Tammy Romo","Yes. We've done our best based on what we know to incorporate all of the associated costs in our guidance. And obviously, if anything changes there, we'll update you. But it includes our -- it's included.","Joe Caiado","Okay. And then I was wondering, are you able to comment on the results of the inspections that you performed on the Wave 1B while they've been grounded and whether you've observed any kind of type of wear pattern that's different than what you expected?","Mike Van de Ven","Joe, are you talking about the fuel nozzle coking?","Joe Caiado","That's right, yes.","Mike Van de Ven","Yes. So when we had -- on March 26, when we were ferrying that last flight from Orlando to Victorville, we did have the in-flight shutdown and it turned back to Orlando. So the working theory on that particular airplane was that there was coking around the fuel nozzles and it created a variance in the hot spots and cold spots in the engine and the hot spot in the engine, we had some damage with respect to a little pressure turbine. So GE went out and asked -- the good thing about the engine temperatures and fuel coking is it's pretty manageable. It builds over time. It lends itself to trends that are detectable and then you can go great procedures to go monitor and inspect and repair or replace those things. So as you asked the industry to look at 25 engines. We looked at 12 of ours. And we've done some engine replacements. We've done some nozzle replacements. The way we're thinking about our fleet sitting down, and I mentioned it earlier, we like to almost get it at a new delivery status when it comes back up and flying. And so if we can do an engine change on that and it precludes us from having to do inspections after we relaunch the fleet, we'd rather go do things like that.","Gary Kelly","Joe, I think the only thing I would add to that is that every new engine, at least in my experience, has its -- I would just call it, break-in issues. And it doesn't matter whether it's a CFM engine or some other manufacturer. And our technical operations work with the manufacturer to develop inspections and repair processes. And they are doing what they need to do to maintain these engines. So I think in that regard, I didn't want you to get the impression that we are doing investigative work here on the engines right now. We're not doing that. We know what we need to be doing. We're working with CFM to clear some of these items out so that they don't have to be inspected and, especially the fuel nozzle example that Mike was using, as frequently. But it's not unusual for an engine to have some break-in things happen. And the engine for the most part has performed in line with our expectations, especially with the fuel efficiency. It's a great, quiet ride and it's a good engine, and I expect to -- I only expect it to get better.","Ryan Martinez","Well, great, that concludes the analyst portion of our call. Of course, if you have any other questions, please reach out to me. And thank you all for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications Officer.","Linda Rutherford","Thank you, Cody. And welcome to the members of our meeting on today's call. We'll go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion. And, Cody, if you would just go ahead and give them instructions on how to queue up.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal.","Alison Sider","Can you tell us anything about sort of how you're thinking about steps you'll take once the MAX is eventually allowed to fly again, steps you'll take to reassure passengers, set people's minds at ease that it is safe? Have you started having those sorts of conversations with Boeing or with the pilots or flight crew? What kind of messaging should we expect around that?","Gary Kelly","Alison, this is Gary. I think you should expect messaging. I don't think we're ready, Tom, to say exactly what that is yet. But it's a great airplane. Boeing is a great company. This is -- we're looking forward to, obviously, working with the FAA to get it ungrounded. And we'll gauge our messaging according to what questions our customers have, to a large degree. But, Tom, any thoughts you want to share there?","Tom Nealon","That's a pretty good question. I think everyone's asking the same question. There's just so much media and coverage on the topic that everyone's got an opinion, and I think that there's certainly going to be some people that I expect would probably book away for some period of time. That's probably -- I have no idea how to quantify that, by the way. But I think there will be some people that do that. I think we have a very good understanding between our marketing team and our communications team. We're doing a lot of work understanding what our customers' perceptions are, what their understanding is of the issues, what their awareness is of the issues, what their concerns are with the issues. So I think we have a pretty good perspective on that. I think what's also pretty interesting, at least from my perspective, is since this has been going on, our customers' perception of the Southwest Airlines, the brand, the company, the people, has not changed at all with the grounding of the MAX. There's some words that they use when they talk to us about what they think of us and they use words like they're very loyal to Southwest. They have a lot of confidence in Southwest. They have a lot of trust in Southwest. And I think they have good reason to have confidence and trust because, as you've heard throughout the call, we know the 737 better than any carrier in the world, and they understand that about us. So we're working through our plan right now. And I can tell you that we'll have a very comprehensive plan that communicates directly to our customers and our employees every step of the way. But that's -- there's more work to be done as we learn more, but we're very focused on it. So appreciate the question.","Gary Kelly","But we'll certainly want to share what we have done to satisfy ourselves that the airplane is ready to return to service. And I think Boeing has work to do to clarify exactly what this functionality is for, what it's not for, because I do think there is a lack of understanding in the media even. And so there's work to be done, I think, on both fronts. But I'm confident that we're up to that task. And I think what Tom mentioned again, we mentioned earlier, which is key, which is we have a great brand. It's one that people trust. And we earn that every day. So we'll want to certainly be mindful of that and message what we are comfortable in committing to. And clearly, we're not going to do anything that we think is unsafe. So that's not even a topic. That's not even a question. But I agree with Tom. I think that there'll be those questions and I think people will get -- I think they will quickly get comfortable with the answers.","Alison Sider","And if I could just ask one follow-up. Have you been sort of surveying customers about how they're feeling about the MAX right now? Is that something you've been directly communicating about with people? And what kind of responses have you been getting?","Gary Kelly","Yes. That's what Tom mentioned, is, yes, we're absolutely doing that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Koenig from the Associated Press.","David Koenig","Here is another of those questions, I guess. First, Gary, are you going to seek compensation from Boeing over the groundings? Can we talk about the hit to CASM, the additional fuel spending? Clearly, there's a hit to your revenue. And I'm also -- I'm sorry, it was hard to hear Tom, when he was talking about people booking away. But can you give some sense of what magnitude you expect that to be? Is it going to be serious enough that you might not be even be able to use all 34 of the planes you've got plus the 41 you're supposed to get?","Gary Kelly","No. I don't think we're going to have any concern or any risk of using all 34 airplanes. And we'll fill them up just like we always do. The only point I was trying to make was there's certainly going to be some people that are concerned, and they may be intimidated to fly for some short period of time. I don't think it's going to be a massive issue for us. I think that our customers know us, trust us, they know we go the 737. So I don't want to overstate my comment or have my comment inflated. I was just raising that as I wouldn't surprise me if a few people said that. But I think we're going to be fine.","David Koenig","I appreciate that clarification. That's good. But are you basing that on surveys that you're doing or are you basing that on history of past planes that have had accidents, what?","Gary Kelly","Yes, we're basing that, David, on the customers that we are talking to. And we're doing a lot of research, if you will, with third parties as well as directly with our customers. And we're very attentive to what is the customer's perception of the brand through our trip Net Promoter Score as well as our brand Net Promoter Score as well as what we're hearing and seeing on social media. So I think we've got a really good handle on what our customers are thinking and feeling and what we need to be doing. And then on the Boeing aspect of your question, well, yes, we're not happy with this situation. Who would be? Boeing has already conceded that there are things that they need to address and, obviously, we totally agree with that. We have a great partnership. We're the -- I think without a doubt, the most successful airline in history. We've got an impeccable safety record. In terms of our partnership, what's important, obviously, is where we go from here. And I would fully expect that we'll continue to have a great partnership with the Boeing company. With respect to anything along the lines of business arrangements or our contract arrangements or whatever it might be, those are things that we'll take up with Boeing privately. And again, I would just restate the obvious, that this is not a good situation. And we'll all need to work together to work our way out of it. Boeing is a very fine company. They build fantastic airplanes. Mike has said this many times, when we launched the MAX, the MAX 8 we felt was the best narrow-body airplane in the world, ever. And there's every reason to believe that, that will continue to be the case once it returns to service with this software modification.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","I have a couple of quick questions for Mike. Mike, I wanted to ask you following up on the Leap engine question, are you finding a degrading of any of the parts like the fuel nozzle sooner than you would've expected on those planes due to the coking? And my second question is, what intrigued you enough about the A220 that you actually went to Airbus to take a look at the plane?","Tom Nealon","Well, starting on the fuel nozzle issue, Mary, I don't know if it's any sooner than we expected. Coking is not unusual. If there is a good thing about coking on fuel nozzles, they built over time, their trends are detectable and you can clearly create monitoring and inspection and repair or replace procedures to take care of all of that. As Boeing learns more about it, as they monitor their worldwide fleet, I'm certain that they will have design changes or design improvements that they will get into the production line and it will mitigate the inspections that we'll need to do on a go-forward basis.","Gary Kelly","And I think that's key, Mary. Mike used the word learning and it was CFM, not Boeing. But it's anything that is new, there will be learnings. And there will be things that were designed and intended to operate -- or perform a certain way that don't. So that was the point I was trying to make early on the analyst call. That's certainly taking place here.","Tom Nealon","Yes, Mary, I don't think that this Leap engine in its maturity, I don't think it\u2019s all -- its maturity curve is all that different than what this CFM engine was, what the gear turbo fan is, what the Rolls-Royce engine on the 787 is. They all have a kind of a maturity curve. And this one feels, at least in my history at Southwest, we feel like we're right on that curve.","Gary Kelly","You make an excellent point. CFM 56 has been a phenomenal engine, and it had a rocky start. And whatever the CFM was before that on the Classic, same thing. It had kind of rocky start, and GE and CFM do a wonderful job. Do you want to talk about Airbus?","Mike Van de Ven","Yes. So, Mary, our fleet team was down in Europe and visiting, but that's not anything unusual. We have relationships with all the OEMs, most of the lessors around the world. And we're just always out there trying to discuss and evaluate economics and opportunities in airplanes. And I had an opportunity to go out to the Paris Air Show last year. And it was a great opportunity for me because I got to talk with Boeing and GE about the MAX. I got to learn a little bit about Airbus and NEO. Bombardier was out there with the C Series at that time. I talked to Embraer. I talked to Pratt & Whitney. And it was just a great way to go, just gather information about the marketplace out there. Every one of those people have great products and great airplanes and really, that was just nothing more than our fleet team trying to gain a little understanding of what's out there.","Gary Kelly","And, Mary, I did want to add to this, I want to be very clear, the timing is a bit unfortunate. And I dread speculation that it's intentional on our part to perhaps consider a change from our current direction with Boeing and the MAX, and that is not true. We didn't reveal that we took this trip. That was a leak by somebody. And so, again, I just wanted to point out there's -- we're not trying to send any message whatsoever. This trip was planned a long time ago, Mike. And so I'll just leave it at that. We have no plan to do anything other than grow our fleet with the MAX. Will that be the case into perpetuity? I'm not prepared to say that. But in any event, the timing is unfortunate.","Mary Schlangenstein","So, Mike, did you like the A220?","Mike Van de Ven","Yes. But, Mary, I like all new toys, shiny new toys.","Gary Kelly","Well, it's a great airplane. It is a great airplane.","Mike Van de Ven","Yes. But, Mary, [Indiscernible] and I like them all. I like the A220. I like the Embraer product. It was just -- it's kind of like going to a new car show. You just like all the different products that you see out there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters.","Tracy Rucinski","So just to follow up a little bit on those comments, Gary. At what point would you consider making any additions or changes to your fleet? I know you have about 250 or more MAX on order through 2026. When would it be reasonable to consider adding any other models and what might those be?","Gary Kelly","Well, I'll be a little repetitive. We're not planning on adding a different aircraft fleet to -- aircraft type to our fleet, okay. So I'd just repeat that. We are not planning to do that. As a practical matter, we are -- we want to grow our airline and we will grow the airline over the next several years, Mike, at least with the Boeing MAX as a practical matter. So in order for us to add a different aircraft type, that would be work for us, and that's not work that would be completed in 12 months. I don't want to put a timeline on it because we're not working on it and I don't know how long it would take to do that. So hopefully, that at least gives you some parameters to think about. What we might be doing 10 years from now or 20, that's just not what we're talking about here today. But we have no intention of doing anything different in the near term whatsoever. And we're not preparing ourselves as if we have to do something different in the medium to long term either. That doesn't mean we won't change our minds. And there's -- as usual, there's all those caveats. So Mike really answered the question. We have the Airbus, the A220 is new, and we have an obligation to look at it and understand what it is. It is in our wheelhouse, so to speak. It's a narrow-body airplane that would be eligible for consideration to do the mission. That's what he's doing and nothing more.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Ghim-Lay Yeo from Flightglobal.","Ghim-Lay Yeo","I just had a question regarding the 737 retirement plan. I know, Gary, you said that you would like to avoid having to unwind the retirement plan for 2019. And I was just wondering if Southwest intends on doing any short-term leases of 737 NGs or just going out to the used marketplace? What are you seeing in the market in terms of pricing and availability, especially with the release on 737 flight capacity currently? Thank you.","Gary Kelly","Well, it's a great question, and I think it's a short, easy answer. The answer is no, we are not contemplating going out into the used market. I think the only thing that would, Mike, make sense to me is if we wanted to add some NGs to the fleet is we would unwind some of the airplanes that we already own or lease. And again, we don't have a plan to do that. Tammy, I think you've got 18 retirements planned for 2019.","Tammy Romo","For 2019.","Gary Kelly","And Tammy mentioned that her plan at this point is to follow through with at least most of them. So there might be a couple of airplanes that we change our mind and decide to keep. But all of this is working under the assumption that the grounding -- that the airplane is ungrounded in the relatively near future and that way, we don't have to wrestle with that question. If it's grounded for an extended period of time, we'll have to develop a plan, quite frankly. And I don't think, Mike, that would include going out onto the used market. But to be honest with your question, we just -- we're not working on that scenario. And we just -- because we don't think it is a worthwhile effort, because we don't think it is a likely scenario. If that scenario materializes, I'm very confident that we can react to it and handle it, but it's nothing that we're working on.","Mike Van de Ven","Yes. We've been out of the used market for the last couple of years. We've got most of the NG airplanes out there that we like. It just doesn't make a lot of practical sense for us to go out and search the market for a used or leased NG when we already have NGs on the property that are already in our maintenance program, already in our maintenance profile. It'd just be easier for us to extend that than it would be to go out and get a new airplane. So we're not looking out in the market at all for NGs.","Gary Kelly","And the reason that we don't want to unwind the retirements, that would certainly be vastly easier compared to bringing another airplane on in the market, like Mike said. But he's already set a maintenance program for each one of these tail numbers and we would have to redo our maintenance plan to then add in maintenance under the assumption that we're keeping the aircraft longer. And that's the kind of work that I would -- I just don't want our tech ops department to have to add to their list. They have other things that I think are more important to work on. And we prefer to continue on with the retirement of those airplanes and bring on new airplanes to replace them.","Ghim-Lay Yeo","Sure. And just, Gary, you mentioned that there has been no indication so far that there might be additional simulator training for the 737 MAX for when it becomes ungrounded. Is that just from what you gather from your discussions with Boeing and the FAA? Are you hearing anything from the union at all with regards to that?","Gary Kelly","Correct. That's from all parties we've talked to. And certainly, I put great reliance on our pilots, on our flight operations leadership, our pilot union. And they are very confident in what we do as an airline, how we train. We just made a $250 million investment in our flight training facility, which is absolutely state-of-the-art and a huge source of pride here. And they are the litmus test for me and they are confident in the airplane, in the training, in the return to service with still some questions to be answered, admittedly. But if they were not, then I would not be. But the fact of the matter is they're very comfortable with the plan as we currently understand it.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda Rutherford","Thank you, Cody.

My name is Tom and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call to discuss our first quarter 2017 performance. Please note, today's call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section at Southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","Joining me on the call today we have, Gary Kelly, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Nealon, President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.","We will begin with Gary providing an overview of our performance, followed by Tammy providing a more detailed review of our first quarter results and current outlook. Following Tammy's remarks, all of our call participants will be available to answer your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Marcy, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. It was another strong performance with an operating margin of almost 13% despite higher fuel prices. For the first time in a while, the First Call consensus estimate for the quarter was too high by $0.02. However, our revenue and cost performances were both within our expectations.","Our revenue expectations were reset, of course, in March, down 2% to 3% for the quarter. For costs ex-fuel and profitsharing, we came in always slightly over our budget and at the high-end of the range, but the quarter includes a lot of noise with year-over-year union contract increases and settlements as well as our final readiness for the launch of our new reservation system, which is in 12 days.","Revenue trends were solid for the quarter and that they improved slightly compared to fourth quarter. I was hoping for more improvement than that, but it appears that first quarter GDP was soft, and we also had a lot of weather impacts in the quarter as well and that was particularly in California. But at least, we didn't lose any momentum that was gained in the fourth quarter. But importantly, the second quarter trends suggest a significant improvement, benefiting somewhat from the Easter holiday timing, but more significantly from a strengthening yield environment. So I feel like we're experiencing an inflection point between the fourth, first, and second quarters. We have positive unit revenue trends in April thus far, and we're estimating to be up 1% to 2% for all of the second quarter on a RASM basis.","Second quarter cost trends are pretty similar to first quarter but better year-over-year. We've had the same cost drivers in that we have the snap-up in union labor rates and costs associated with our technology implementations. So these year-over-year trends improved dramatically in the second half of the year. That is the year-over-year unit cost trends.","And as we said in the release, we are on plan for the year with our unit costs ex fuel and profitsharing. So with improving revenue trends, despite somewhat higher fuel cost per gallon than a year ago, once again, we're hopeful that our second quarter EPS will compare much better to the year ago than the first quarter did versus a year ago.","Our goal is positive year-over-year comparisons for EPS in the second half of this year. And, of course, that's dependent on a lot of things but certainly on the yield environment and fuel prices. But that is our goal is to have second half EPS growth.","With respect to capacity, there is no change from our year-end report in January. We've got 3.5% available seat mile growth planned for this year, and we're scheduled out into the third quarter. And that's including less than 1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of this year.","Following the fourth quarter, I expect the first half next year to come in less than 4% and also each quarter. And along those lines, there has been no change to our fleet plans for 2017 or 2018 other than the fact that we exercised five -800 options as planned for 2018 delivery.","So we're still retiring all of the Classics by the end of September of this year. There's 79 of them remaining. We started this year with 723 aircraft in the fleet. We still plan to end this year, after grounding the Classics, with 703 aircraft. With the firm commitments that we have for deliveries for next year, that will take us to 746 aircraft at the end of 2018, which is within our fleet growth target of no more than 2% through the end of next year.","We have four unexercised options for 2018. So if we exercised those, of course, that would put us at 750 airplanes, which is what we have in the press release. So we're approaching our 2017 and 2018 growth cautiously. We're managing the grounding of the Classics, which potentially makes for some comparability noise in late 2018. But as we said in the release, in any event, our full year growth will be below 2016, as we had previously indicated. So no new news on any of those fronts.","We're very excited about this year. We're ready to deploy our new reservation system in 12 days. We're on track to open the new international concourse at Ft. Lauderdale's Terminal 1 in June. We're ready to launch international flights out of that new terminal, including Grand Cayman as a new destination. And as we reported this morning, we'll be adding another new destination to Fort Lauderdale. And that will be Turks & Caicos, and that will be in fourth quarter of this year.","Separately, we're very excited to round out our 48-state route map with new service to Cincinnati cranking up in June.","And finally, we're excited and on track to launch the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and that's scheduled for October 1. My thanks and congratulations to Boeing and GE for producing a magnificent airplane and one that we are confident will be the low-cost leader of the narrow-body market.","Now this is the best start that we've had to a year in my memory, and that's considering our operations, our customers, and our economics all in the aggregate. I am very proud of our people. They run a great airline every single day.","Last week, we just celebrated our Annual ProfitSharing Day, and today, we celebrate another strong performance. So again, congratulations to all of them and thank you to all 54,000-plus Southwest warriors.","So, Tammy, with that quick overview, I'll turn it over to you.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","All right, thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. I'd like to start by extending my thanks and congratulations as well to our employees on a strong start to the year. Our first quarter profits were a strong $351 million and excluding special items, $372 million.","This produced first quarter operating margins of 13.5% and 12.8% excluding special items, which were very strong and looks to be among the industry-leading performances and would have been even stronger without our fuel hedge losses which will burn off by year-end.","Coming into the quarter, we faced difficult year-over-year comparisons. The revenue yield environment, which was stable but still competitive and the Easter shift to April from March last year created challenging comparisons. And as Gary mentioned, we were also impacted by the severe weather in California.","On the cost side, last year's first quarter fuel prices were much lower. We also had cost pressures from higher wage rates associated with our amended union contracts as well as various costs associated with the upcoming implementation of our new reservation system.","Our balance sheet, liquidity, cash flows, and ROIC were also strong in the first quarter. On balance, I'm very pleased with the strength of our first quarter results, which enabled the continuation of significant returns for our shareholders and $99 million of profitsharing for our employees.","We're off to a great start here in the second quarter with encouraging revenue trends. Our first quarter revenue performance was strong with record passenger revenues and a strong demand environment. Operating revenues were also a first quarter record and declined 2.8% on a unit basis.","This RASM performance was within our range of guidance and relatively in line on a sequential basis. While the biggest driver of the year-over-year decline in first quarter RASM was the competitive yield environment, it does feel like we have hit an inflection point here in April.","Other revenues also had another strong performance, driven by Rapid Rewards and other ancillary sources of revenues, especially EarlyBird and Upgraded Boarding products. And we expect another year-over-year increase in other revenues in second quarter 2017.","Overall, as we noted in our earnings release, second quarter RASM is estimated to increase in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. Even without the Easter benefit of approximately $10 million, our year-over-year unit revenue trends are currently positive. Our second quarter RASM outlook is encouraging and represents roughly four points of year-over-year sequential improvement.","Turning to cost. Our first quarter cost performance was within our expectations. Low fuel prices in first quarter last year drove challenging year-over-year fuel comparisons and a 10.1% increase in our economic fuel price.","In the current environment of higher fuel prices, our fleet modernization and other fuel saving initiatives are meaningful, especially as we get to the second half of the year and our Classics are retired. In first quarter, our fuel gallons increased less than our capacity, resulting in fuel efficiency gains year-over-year.","Based on market prices last Friday and our current second quarter hedge position, we expect our second quarter fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.95 to $2 per gallon range. Our second quarter fuel cost estimate includes $0.29 in hedging losses, which is also the amount of hedging loss we expect for third and fourth quarters based on our current hedge position and market prices.","With fuel hedge losses significantly below where they were last year, we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon in second half of this year to decrease year-over-year. So, for the full year 2017, we currently estimate a fuel price per gallon in the $1.95 to $2 range.","Excluding fuel, our unit costs increased largely due to higher wage rates from labor contracts as well as approximately $40 million in costs associated with our new reservation system and operational initiatives. Our second quarter CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profitsharing, is expected to increase approximately 6% year-over-year, with about 3.5 points of this increase related to the labor contracts amended last year.","The remaining increase relates to costs associated with our technology and operational initiatives as well as the rollout of our new uniforms. Our full year 2017 unit cost outlook remains unchanged. And excluding fuel, special items and profitsharing, we expect 2017 unit costs to increase approximately 3% year-over-year, almost entirely driven, when it's all said and done, by the one snap-up in wage rates from the new labor contracts.","This includes our expectation that unit costs will trend to flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Considering our modest capacity growth plan for fourth quarter, our unit cost outlook is quite notable, and we are not stopping there. We are very focused on controlling our costs to drive incremental efficiencies and widen our competitive cost advantage.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with our industry-leading investment-grade balance sheet, which is strong as ever. Similar to last year's first quarter, we allowed our cash to build as we funded our 2016 profitsharing accruals, as Gary mentioned, earlier this month.","Our strong operating cash flow and manageable CapEx resulted in a record first quarter free cash flow of $1.2 billion. For full year 2017, our cash flow outlook remains strong, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $2.3 billion.","Aircraft CapEx is estimated to be $1.4 billion, and non-aircraft spend is estimated to be in the $800 million to $900 million range, which includes $250 million of technology spend on our reservation system and operational initiatives.","During first quarter, we returned $673 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Our shareholder returns increased almost 13% year-over-year and in the first quarter alone we have given back more than a third of our total shareholder returns for all of last year.","In addition to completing the $300 million accelerated share repurchase launched in fourth quarter of 2016, we launched and completed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase during first quarter. We also repurchased $50 million of common stock in open market transactions, which leaves $400 million remaining under our current $2 billion buyback authorization.","In March, we paid our 162nd consecutive dividend at an annual payout ratio of nearly 11%. Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is now just over 30%. And as ever, preserving our strong balance sheet and cash flows remains a priority, and we also remain committed to returning significant value to shareholders.","Turning now to fleet and capacity. Our plans continue to support prudent and profitable network growth. We ended the quarter with 727 aircraft in our fleet and continue to expect our total fleet to decline to just over 700 aircraft by year-end. This incorporates the retirement of the remaining 79 Classics by the end of September and the addition of 41 more NG aircraft and 14 MAX-8s this year.","We're very excited about the launch of the MAX into service this October, which we expect will bring continued fuel efficiency gains. Just on the network side, it's performing very well. Our upcoming consolidation of our Ohio operations, including the launch of service to Cincinnati, is a prime example of how we continue to optimize our network to meet the needs of our customers.","And with the transformative strategic initiatives behind us, including the May 9 implementation of our new reservation system, we are well-positioned to consider the exciting growth opportunities ahead. We're monitoring our new market development closely and we'll continue to add markets at a pace that supports our revenue and profitability targets.","Our 2017 capacity growth remains unchanged at approximately 3.5% year-over-year.","With this brief overview, I'll just close here again by congratulating our employees on a great quarter and exciting year ahead.","So, with that, Tom, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. We'll now begin with our first question, comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","You bet, Jack.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","So, Gary, if I can go back to your prepared comments for a moment, you referenced the 2018 capacity plans. And I know you don't want to get into those in too much depth because the plan is still coming together. But you said the plan was to have around 4% ASM growth in the first half, but then you referenced quarterly growth and then I think you said more challenging comps in the fourth quarter. If you could just expand on that for a moment if you would, and just to make sure we're all on the same page on what 2018 should look like from a capacity growth perspective?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I'd be happy to. And I'm just going to repeat what I said, Jack. There is no more than \u2013 it will be less than 4%. It won't be 4%, it will be less than 4% for the first quarter and for the second quarter and obviously for the first half combined. And I'm comfortable in sharing that with you at this point. And beyond that, I'm not willing to give any specific targets.","My only reference on the fourth quarter is that because fourth quarter this year may be closer to flat year-over-year, and once we start restoring the flyings that we were doing with the grounded Classics, we'll see some growth that is higher than normal in the fourth quarter for sure. However, and I want to be clear on this, we have not committed to a schedule for the second half of 2018, where as time goes by, we're getting more and more committed, of course, to the first half. But I think the overriding message is the same as what we've been saying and that we're still approaching our capacity growth cautiously.","One of the things that we were trying to accomplish in 2017, and if necessary by extension, into 2018, is to give our developing markets an opportunity to mature and put ourselves in a position where we are confident that positive unit revenue growth is realistic. So, those will continue to be the guiding principles.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you for that clarification. And then for my follow-up question, if I could ask about the new reservation system rollout, just sort of curious what sort of preparations have you guys been making sort of going into this rollout here over the next couple of weeks? And if you could help us think about the incremental costs that are maybe flowing through to P&L related to training and that sort of thing that maybe roll off, I guess, as we get into the back half of the year. And then just the priorities around utilizing the new system, because I know it will give you significantly increased capabilities once it's rolled out.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I'd be happy to and I'll defer to Tammy to give you some further insights on the cost implications here. But this is a multiyear effort, Tom, this has been under development for three years. And so it is fair to assume that a lot of technology construction occurred prior to this year, but they're still in the finishing up phases. So we have a fairly significant spending in the first quarter related to the technology efforts. A lot of testing, of course, is taking place at this point.","And then from Mike Van de Ven's perspective, Mike, I think you were training 20,000 employees, weren't you? So we have a lot of our call agents already prepared to take orders on the first part of the release, which was back in December, but they still had continued training here this year. And then all of our airport employees, we refer to as ground operations, are undergoing the training for the new departure systems. So it's very significant. It's all hands on deck. It's a fairly significant amount of spending.","The other thing that is beyond just \u2013 as you can imagine, the training is additional time on our employees' part. So both the commercial departments previously and our operations departments have increased their staffing to make sure that number one, we have the time available for the training, and then number two, to be prepared for a learning curve where transactions might take more time.","So you do note that the employee head count is up roughly 7% \u2013 I think it's 7.3% year-over-year. And that's a lot of that \u2013 that's a lot of the cost for that increase.","Tammy, you want to speak more directly to the cost implications of that?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure, I'd be happy, happy to do that. As I mentioned in my comments, we had about $40 million in costs in the first quarter associated with our new reservation system and operational initiative. And so as I think about our comparisons in the first half versus the second half, we have probably 1 point to 2 points related to the wind-down of our reservation system and timing of efficiencies related to our operational investments. So, it is significant and we'll get some relief here as we move into the second half of the year.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So, I think to summarize, we definitely staffed up for the effort. And then there's sort of a final push with technology people, our technology partners. And it shows up in our spending. There's no question. If you look in the other operating expenses line, you'll see that it's up, don't have it in front of me, I think it's 12 point \u2013 maybe 11%. But in any event, there's a pretty large increase in that category. So there are a lot of the technology-related costs that are hitting in that line item.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you again for the time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mr. Linenberg, please check your mute button, we cannot hear you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Mike, you there? We can't hear you.","Operator","We will go ahead and move on to Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey, thank you. Appreciate the question. Sorry for a modeling question, but to get to the full year guide, it looks like it also implies that the third quarter is going to be a pretty muted growth rate in CASM X as well. Could you explain what would be driving that?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure. And just to kind of help you as we progress here from the first half to the second half on our unit costs, we already mentioned that about 1 point to 2 points of the cost pressures were experienced here in the first quarter is related to our reservation system and the timing of efficiencies related to our operational investments. We have probably a point related to the timing of our union contracts.","And then also as you move into the fourth quarter, we'll continue to see savings associated with the retirement of our Classic fleet. So that's about a point, which you'll see reflected in lower depreciation and maintenance costs. And then that probably accounts for most of it. I'm not ready to give you specific guidance on third quarter versus fourth quarter. But I do think that by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we should be, call it, roughly flat to year-ago levels, excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thank you. And then just for my follow-up, is there a plan to update your thinking on capital allocation at your Annual Shareholders' Meeting, or are you going to follow that typical cadence? And if so, any new thoughts or looking backwards, buyback versus dividends, any new thoughts in that perspective? Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, we haven't done anything so far. So there's nothing to report today. We have a board meeting in May, and of course, that is a board-level decision. And we would \u2013 we've had discussions, as you would expect, with our board. We meet every other month, so we meet 6 times a year, so we had a March meeting, but have made no firm decisions or commitment \u2013 made no commitments yet. So, it's something that we'll take up in May, Duane, it's a very fair question. And I think all I would say is to reiterate what Tammy said and I think I've said, which is we're very focused on shareholder returns. Those are two key questions and we'll certainly discuss that again in May.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for getting me on the call here. Gary, I appreciate the outlook on capacity here at least through the first half of 2018. But as you're going through your reservation system cutover and the fleet transition, should we be thinking that this is more an outlook on low capacity growth, because you're physically constrained? Or should we be thinking that actually, this is what the market feels (31:09) so this is where we're growing, and if we saw better opportunities, we'd be growing faster even with those constraints today?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I've tried to be clear on that. So, you quiz me if I'm not hitting the mark here. I think, first of all, there's a fairly long cycle between the time that you decide that you want to add capacity and when it finally shows up. So there is some physical nature to all of this. We are growing 3.5% this year. Some of that admittedly is because we're accelerating the retirement of the Classics. However, we've been straightforward with you all and said that we did want to slow our growth this year, so that was \u2013 it was a factor in us arriving at the decision to go ahead and accelerate the retirement of that fleet, if you understand my point.","Said a different way, if we really felt like we needed to be growing faster this year and we just had to have lift, I bet we would probably have tried to find a way, Mike, to keep those airplanes. So, the stars aligned pretty well for us there. The other thing that Mike has done a beautiful job of, especially over the last four years to five years, is creating more fleet flexibility for us. And so I mentioned purposefully with my remarks that right now, we're fully committed with deliveries that would suggest that we'll end 2018 at 746 airplanes.","We have the option to get four more and we haven't exercised that yet. We haven't made that decision yet. So the answer to your question is both of those are inputs, but what we're trying to do mostly is match our capacity to the demand. We want to grow our route system. We want to grow it in a way that we can sustain positive unit revenue growth as well as hit our ROIC and our profit targets.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I think it's been articulated, Gary. I think it's helpful for investors to hear that message over and over. I guess, the fear would be though that as your fuel hedge losses run out next year, is there to be temptations as wow, now we're just naturally making more money, so maybe we should be growing more than we had? Or is that not really factoring into the outlook?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, of course, it is. In other words, if you just \u2013 logic would say the reverse. If we weren't making money, would we be going out and growing? Well, of course not. You need to fix what you have first before you think about growing. But our margins are really good right now. They're near industry-leading margins that everybody here has worked hard for and is very proud of. So we don't want to extrapolate record returns on capital into infinity and adjust growth plans to that notion. That would be very imprudent to do.","So we're not doing that. We haven't done that. We've tried to be clear that in particular, the growth rates that we realized in 2015 and 2016 were unusual, and you should not expect that we think that we should be growing at those rates going forward. But I think it's mainly a matter of just, we want to grow and we need to grow. We need to strengthen our route system. It's a very competitive industry out there, and that's one of the key weapons that we have. But we need to do that in a way that we can make sure that we sustain our profitability, our balance sheet, shareholder returns, all of those things.","I think we've done a nice job of balancing all that, and there's a 46-year history here and there's no reason to believe that we're going to deviate from those objectives.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Appreciate the insight. Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, sir.","Operator","And we'll take our next question \u2013 actually, we'll go back to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, can you guys hear me now?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","We can hear you now, you can do a telephone commercial, yes.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I got to move up on my phone here. Hey, I guess two quick ones. I guess, Gary, back to your introductory remarks. You talked about a real strengthening in yields, what you saw coming into the June quarter. And I think, Tammy, you mentioned about an inflection point in April. And I think if we can move Easter aside, are you seeing it on the close-in booking side? Is it leisure-driven? Like what's \u2013 like this uptick, where are you seeing it, what passenger segments?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Happy to speak to that. Yes, I know I'm delighted to speak about revenues because we are encouraged by our outlook here in the second quarter. And, Mike, we're really seeing \u2013 it's pretty broad-based improvement in our sequential trends. So, yes, so, I think it's really just a broader comment.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then just my second question on, Gary, for 2018 first half, you said less than 4% in the March and June quarter. How do we think about the split between domestic and international? Like what \u2013 is it 1\/3, 2\/3?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Let me just \u2013 I'm going to think out loud with you because I don't know, I can give you at least a sense of direction there. But we're going to end this year with a capacity split of about 96% domestic and 4% \u2013 not quite 4%, so it's about 96%-plus and a little bit less than 4% international. We're growing international pretty aggressively here in 2017. It feels to me like it will grow less aggressively in 2018. And that's an understanding that we haven't made firm commitments here and we'll debate those as long as we can.","We've decided recently that we were going to go ahead and commit to Turks and Caicos. This relates somewhat to the previous question about how much of this is fixed versus variable. Well, we're committed to this 5-Gate Concourse construction in Fort Lauderdale. We obviously want to follow that through with having a decent array of international flying and so that's a pretty aggressive launch of international for us this year because of that.","And then next year, we're purposefully going to throttle back a bit to again allow these new markets some time to develop. But we don't have a lot of new flying that we're adding this year. A lot of the year-over-year increase is simply the full year effect of adding routes last year. So this is a pretty conservative year. And I think next year, except for some of the comparability issue maybe fourth quarter year-over-year, it's going to be a pretty routine year, it feels like.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody. How are you? Gary, last quarter, you referred to potential ATC reform as being, I take these for your words, I'm paraphrasing here, highly beneficial for your customers and your employees, something along those lines. My concern obviously is that it would potentially free up airplane time. That would lead to higher capacity, and we kind of know how that movie plays out. How does ATC reform help Southwest? And how much capacity would it potentially free up?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, Jamie, let's not make a good thing a bad thing.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","...to be more efficient. The problem that we have today, and I'm sure my colleagues, if you ask them or you may have already \u2013 they may have already made these comments, but we're already seeing increased delays this year being imposed by the FAA because of staffing shortages. So the on-time performance of the industry is pretty good and inarguably very good.","Well, all that means is that we've simply adjusted our flight times to be longer, anticipating increasing inefficiencies. And every year, we get more. So it's as simple as taking city A to city B and those en route times are just far greater today or the total block time I should say, far greater today than they were 10 years, 20 years, much less 30 years ago. So what I would argue for our investors and certainly for the company is that we'll provide better customer service, which ought to be healthier demand and we'll be able to provide these flights far more efficiently, which ought to be less cost and more affordable for our customers. So it's a double win for the customer, but it's just a \u2013 what company would choose to operate less efficiently? It's just nonsensical.","So, the other thing I would tell you is that we know that there is a premium part of the day that people want to fly. And to the extent that we can push more of our flying into the mid of the day, we know that, that will also be more productive. Will it create the opportunity for more capacity? Yes, but we have that opportunity already, so we already choose to fly more or less in a given period this year. We could be flying more and we're choosing not to for a variety of reasons.","So I wouldn't make a good thing a bad thing. I think back to the good thing, it's going to be \u2013 it's going to take a huge effort to realize the benefits of ATC modernization. And right now, it's not being realized whatsoever that we're getting less efficient, not more. So you don't have to worry about that anytime soon, unfortunately, but that is the right goal and I think the President is behind that and we've got a long way to go to actually realize it.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And second, on the res system, I thought, suggested somewhere that it's the current res system that explains why don't fly red eyes. And that doesn't really make sense to me because you have something like, I don't know, 75, 80 flights every day that leave on one day and arrive after midnight the next. So I always thought it was how you've flowed aircraft for maintenance, which explain the aversion to red eyes. Was I just mistaken all these years?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","No, I don't think you're totally mistaken. But Mike, you want to talk about some of this \u2013 the current mechanics and restrictions that we have?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, so Jamie on the operating side, we do have flights that go across midnight that our flight planning systems are designed to take that to a certain point. So let's say, I don't know that I have the hour right in my head, but let's say, to 2 o'clock in the morning but to go...","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","And after that, our systems aren't set up to go do that.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And Jamie, you are right. I mean, the airline does have an AM, it has a PM and then that's sort of the third shift of the day, we do dedicate to overnight maintenance. So once we under \u2013 under the assumption that we're going to undertake a significant amount of 'red-eye flying,' we would have to figure all that out.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","We have to negotiate with our flight crews over that other crewing period or...","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","We have those covered in our contracts, but they're difficult because it's hard to put together three-day pairings if you don't have a sufficient number of red-eye flying. And you're exactly right, Jamie, it introduces complexity with respect to the maintenance programs at night. We can navigate through all of those things, but we just haven't had to do that at this point in time in our lives.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It doesn't sound like it's going to be a priority either? Or is \u2013 am I mistaken on that as well?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, again, if you're wondering whether we truly have the capability today, we don't. In our minds.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","We don't have the tools that we would need. And then if that would \u2013 then if you're concerned that, that capability now leads to yet more capacity, we've got a lot of discussion that we need to have before we decide to commit to any meaningful amount of red-eye flying. And it is not, as we sit here in the second quarter of 2017, it is \u2013 we've got a lot other things we're working on and it is not a priority for us.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Very interesting stuff. I'll let everybody else take it back to RASM and CASM, but I really appreciate that operational overview. Thanks, both gentlemen.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for the time. This might be for you, Gary. But as far as the new reservation system that's set to come into place in I guess 12 days or so, can you talk about some of the more prominent features you're seeing benefits from, whether it's scheduling or something else?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Tom, you want to talk about that?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. So let me cover that one. So, you guys know December, we rolled out the first release, right? And that was our last published selling schedule. With R2, which is 12 days away, with the function is there, those are the functions that are really going to be used by the frontline for check-in, boarding passengers, re-accom, that kind of stuff. The third release, which is on track for the second half of 2017, that's where you really begin to see the value come through, right?","So, the kind of capabilities you're talking about there, and this is what gets you the $200 million in EBIT, where you really get to there are the revenue enhancements, probably two big capabilities, one being controls and improved fare flexibility and such, schedule optimization with that third release, which is scheduled variation, days of inventory, things like that. And it also sets the foundation for the international work, right?","So one res sets the foundation for airline codeshare, foreign point-of-sale, language, currency, that kind of stuff, but that's really the back half of 2017 when that will begin to come out live, the value begins to be really kick in, in 2018 and beyond.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. And then a quick question on capacity. Gary, would it be fair to say that what you're trying to point to for next year, that capacity growth will be between 2015 and 2016 levels so that's 3.5% and 5.5%? Or is that getting too granular at this point?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","That's too early to say.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes sir.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning guys. Just on the \u2013 just a little bit on the pricing side to go back to that, and Tammy, I think you mentioned that things are improving and looking very encouraging. How much of that \u2013 and you mentioned competitive pricing still prevalent. What I'm trying to figure out is, is this just a fact of peak season is good and strong and in the off-peak, we just have too much capacity and thinking through what the implications are close to summer season then for pricing.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I don't think so, but I think anything is possible. If you go back to last June, you might remember that we were a bit surprised at the sort of sudden weakening in demand. And that seemed to continue all the way until the fourth quarter, at which time we were pleasantly surprised at the strengthening in demand.","I really thought we would do a little better in the first quarter this year. It wasn't bad. It didn't slip, but it didn't improve as much as we thought. And I made my GDP comment earlier. We've all read about the delay in tax refunds and the impact that that had on consumer spending. I don't know if that had some impact.","But we're trying to take all those questions, Savi, into account. And taking that into account, we're saying that there is a trend improvement sequentially. And I'm not attributing that to the seasonality. We've got years of history here. And we've moved holidays around and take all those kinds of things into effect, our own growth rate, et cetera, et cetera.","So the yield environment is improving. And in terms of the competition, that's about all we can say at that point, but it is definitely improving compared to what we were seeing last year.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Very helpful, Gary. Thank you and just as a follow-up quickly ask on the hedge assets in 2018 and 2019, just how much of that is in 2018 and how much 2019?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. So on \u2013 for 20 \u2013 you said 2018 and 2019, Savi?","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Exactly. Yeah.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","So 2018 is about $75 million of that.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","So that would leave $33 million for 2019.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","You're very welcome.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks so much for squeezing me in Team.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","You're welcome.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","I hope it's a good question. So I think about your growth on the West Coast in California. Is that more opportunity out there? Is it kind of defending the market against incursion from Alaska and Virgin? Is it neither of the above and something else entirely?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","It's a very strong market. I would say post-recession, sort of post-2007, there was a kind of a typical recessionary effect on short-haul travel. And there's a lot of short-haul travel in the Southwest system in California. So we optimized our route system.","And I'd say over the last several years, we've seen a resurgence in the travel demand there. And we've struggled a bit to keep up with it. So that's one, the travel demand is quite strong and we see a lot of opportunities.","I would couple that though with real estate challenges. So LAX, we're capacity constrained on the ground. We have that problem in Orange County. It's just two quick examples.","So we have more opportunities to grow, except that we just don't have the physical capability to do that with some of our airport constraints there. But where we don't have that, yes, we've had great opportunities and I think that you'll continue to see us very focused on California.","And it's not just us. There's a handful of competitors that are also eyeing California. But it's a great, healthy market and we remain the number one share within and out and to. And any way you look at it, so we're very proud of our position there. And we're going to work hard to stay on top.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then can I just follow-up one question on something you said about facility constraints? As we think about this over the next \u2013 or as you think about it, right, your plans for the next three to five years as you think about the fleet planning and the growth and so on, how should we think about this in terms of infrastructure? How does the infrastructure keep up with the demand that's out there? And is that going to be a very expensive proposition for the industry or the government or the industry because the government can't afford to do it?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, great question, and of course, you've known us for a long time. If you go back to 30 years ago, we didn't have the array of physical constraints on the ground that we face today. Some of that is just because we \u2013 from the sheer fact that we've lowered fares, stimulated demand and we've built facilities, and we've now filled out that capacity.","It's an issue and it's easy to take LAX as a specific example. LAX has billions of dollars' worth of construction programs that are planned probably over the next decade and maybe even beyond.","We've got one that \u2013 we have two in effect that are underway, and we're hopeful that we'll get a third in order to create capacity. I want to say that the \u2013 over the last decade, don't quote me on this, but I think I'll get this right, over the last decade, there've been about $100 billion worth of airport projects undertaken.","So the money is there. And I think the \u2013 if we can sort of remove some barriers so that we can proceed more expeditiously at certain airports, that would be very, very helpful. But if you just take a specific \u2013 and all of these need to be taken up specifically, there are a lot of airports where we have plenty of capacity. And we're trying to take full advantage of that and expand there.","There are airports like Dallas, Love Field, which is at capacity under federal law. So that's sort of off the table in terms of increasing capacity for the airport because it's limited to 20 gates. And there's every flavor in between across the country.","The nice thing for us selfishly is because we're a point-to-point network, and we have a very significant position in dozens of cities, if we're constrained in one market, we've got opportunities in another. And quite frankly, that helps us prioritize because we have far more things that we want to do than we have airplanes.","But it's just the fact that we live with. We have an airport affairs department that is focused on working airport by airport and helping to develop master plans that are sensible so that these communities can grow. You'd hate to live in a city that said no, we're forevermore capped at the current level of travel and tourism.","So you just have to ask yourself as a civic leader, what are we going to do for the next generation? Are we going to promote travel or not in our community? And again -- but that's the way it works, but the money is there. We just want to make sure that the money is spent wisely and spent in the right places.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much for that. I appreciate it.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","You're very welcome.","Operator","And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd first like to introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.","Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thanks, Tom. Welcome today to the members of the media who are on the call. I think we can go ahead and get started in our Q&A session. So, Tom if you'll give them some instructions on how to queue up.","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Thank you for waiting. We'll now begin with our first question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Gary, I wanted to ask you a little bit more about that comment from CNBC today about Southwest ending the practice of overbooking. How soon do you think that policy will go into effect? And can you talk a little bit about the tradeoffs? My understanding is that there's at least some revenue implication to overbooking flights? How much do you guys think you might be giving up by not doing that anymore?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, what I was trying to convey, and thanks for the question, what I was trying to convey this morning on that is it's not a topic that is brand new to us. So for quite some time, we have been challenging ourselves to make the travel experience better for our customers and just make the service better for our employees to deliver. And that's one of the pain points that I'd like to eliminate.","The issue is the economic effect. As time has gone by, we have been fortunate to have fewer and fewer and fewer no shows. So the gross amount of the problem is far less today than it was 20 years ago. We don't overbook much at all already. My recollection, Bob, is that it's about, on a 143-seat airplane, we might overbook by 1.","And it's hard to generalize but it at least gives you some frame of reference. This isn't a vast issue. And we don't \u2013 I never get complaints from our customers about overbooking. I get complaints about any other variety of things. I'm not saying there aren't complaints, and don't get me wrong. But it's just not an issue the way the company has been managing that, and I'm very proud of our folks who are doing that.","But to give you a specific answer, I'm not quite ready to give you an exact timeline, but we're going to move on this very quickly, so certainly during the second quarter. And it's \u2013 we've got Tom Nealon, our President; Bob Jordan, our EVP of Commercial, are both personally working on this.","It turns out that it's a little more complicated than perhaps we would like. But I think our employees will be delighted at this, and I know our customers will be. Then, again, understanding that we don't have that many over-sales in the first place.","The economic effect of it, Tammy, you want to speak to that?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. The economic impact is really fairly, fairly small. Yes, there is a little bit of a revenue impact, but that's been embedded in all the guidance that we've discussed this morning. But there is also some cost savings that will occur that will offset the revenue benefit. So the net impact is really not that meaningful. So I really don't think you'll even see it in our results.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","If I...","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","One of the other questions I got, Conor, this morning, which might help put it in perspective, well, isn't this going to cost you money? Well, what we're trying to do is be the world's most loved airline. And we feel like just putting this in with no change fees, no bag fees, no overbooking, that's who we are. And we're at a point now where we can do all of that and still stay true to our low-fare brand.","And, obviously, the reason that we do overbooking is because it helps generate revenue on that flight and keep the rest of the fares lower. So we don't want to do this in a way that would cost our customers more money. And we think we're at a point now where we can do that, and it just makes sense. So we've been thinking about it for a long time and feel like right now is the time to do it.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","I appreciate the answer. If I could ask one more follow-up, how much did the United Airline incident with the overbooking have to play in announcing? And now did you guys speed up your timeline as a result of that?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","It was \u2013 and I'll be honest with you. It wasn't on my list this month to work on. It wasn't on Tom's. It wasn't on Bob's list. But it is something that we have had on our list over the last couple of years. But it puts the question under a bright light. And, hey, why not do it now? I would ask. And we're ready to do it and we're going to get it done.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering, Gary, if you might be able to comment on the pay increases that American announced yesterday. We've seen some Wall Street analysts say this sets a dangerous precedent or a worrying precedent, I should say, through the industry. I know you just signed a four-year agreement with your pilot group in the last year. Is that something you guys ever considered or do you think your pilots group might be coming back and asking now for additional raises when they're not in the contract negotiation?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I'm going to answer your question in two ways. Number one is just philosophically, we've always worked with our employees that way. Contracts are a framework to work together. And that's a true partnership. And things come up in between contract negotiation dates. We approach union leadership and union leadership approaches us. And so we make changes historically, quote, all the time. And we've had instances in my recollection where we felt like we needed to make some change to pay along the way.","And it's just remembering that nothing is simple when it comes to a labor contract or a labor contract negotiation. So it \u2013 we'll just have to see how simple it is for American to actually execute what they want. I read their communication. I thought it was very well done. But is it a dangerous precedent? No. I mean it is a framework. It's a living document. The only way that works though is if you have a true partnership where issues can \u2013 in a dynamic way, can continue to be addressed.","At the same time, I think everybody understands that it is a contract. Both parties to a contract want to and need to honor what's in the contract, and there needs to be very good reasons to contemplate a change. But is it dangerous? No. And I think it's just part of ongoing negotiations and Herb always said that we negotiate our contracts every single day, and I agree with that.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Thank you so much. I appreciate it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Hi, thanks. Gary, back to the overbooking issue. One little thing. My understanding is, okay, so you're not going to do over-sales at some point but you might still have to bump people if you have crews showing up that need to be accommodated. And secondly, was this change motivated by the fact that last year you bumped -- you had more IDBs than anybody else?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","The answer to the latter one is no, and if you want, I can -- again, by my memory, I can talk to that and Bob may know off the top of his head who, no doubt, knows a lot more about than I do. But the -- and I think overbooking is different than having an over-sale. So if we have a rule that says we won't take any more bookings than there are seats on the airplane, that's one thing. But you're right, David, there's other things that can cause an over-sale.","For one thing, we have different airplane sizes. So if, for whatever reason, we took bookings for an 800, which has more than 143 seats and then that airplane type is not available and we substitute a smaller airplane with a 143 seats, well, you would have an over-sale in that situation. The flight crew part, Mike, I'm sure we have those circumstances. But we work very hard to avoid displacing our customers. We have the ability to add an extra pilot on the airplane in the cockpit, an extra flight attendant. You want to -- that was David's specific question, you want to address that?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, David. The industry just in general has needs for unexpected crew movements every day. So there's weather, there's mechanicals, there's diversions. So that need is going to exist and it always has. And generally speaking, you know, I bet you, we have a lot of customers that when have an opportunity to take a flight an hour or two later and be compensated for, they like that. We haven't had issues historically about dealing with our flight crews. We usually know that well in advance. We can talk to our customers as they're getting up into the gate area and seeing whether or not they're amenable to taking a different flight. And I would say that 99% of the time they are.","Robert E. Jordan - Southwest Airlines Co.","Hey, David. This is Bob. Let me just add two quick things. The denied boarding rate is really small. That happens to about 0.1 -- less, actually less than 0.1% of our customers. So it's a very small number. Now if you're caught up in that, that's no fun but it's a very small number that are denied boarding to start with. But about 80% of those are actually from the revenue management practice of overbooking or overselling. So that's what we're going to stop and so the vast majority of denied boardings will go away because the vast majority of the overbookings are going to go away.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Man, I am sorry to say my question's already been answered so I'm going to let you guys off easy today.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, actually you worked me really hard already.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thanks, Mary. Good talking to you.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Thank you.","Operator","All right.

My name is Greg, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Martinez","Thank you, Greg, and welcome, everyone. Joining me today, we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, our President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO and other members of our senior leadership team.","Please note that our comments today will include forward-looking statements and those are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections. A variety of factors could cause our actual results to be materially different from our current expectations. And we'll also make references to non-GAAP results, which exclude special items. So for more information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP, please visit the Investor Relations section of southwest.com.","Before we get started, I want to provide an update on the cadence of our planned investor updates for 2019. Beginning this year, we will discontinue the leasing month and traffic statistics, however, we will continue to practice we began last year providing a quarterly investor update in the last month of each quarter that would be March, June, September and December typically around mid-month.","So with that intro, I will turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Kelly","Thank you, Ryan and thanks everyone for joining us for the fourth quarter 2018 earnings call.","The earnings were outstanding -- an outstanding way to close an important but a very challenging year. I'm very grateful to all of our Southwest people. They are extraordinary and they really showed their resilience and their fortitude. They did an exceptional job and they have set us up very, very well for what ought to be a banner and a record year in 2019.","Our celebration is bittersweet; this is the first earnings report in history of Southwest Airlines without our beloved Herb Kelleher. It is a huge loss for us. It is a huge loss of course for Herb's family and really countless friends and acquaintances around the world that he touched in someway. World owes him a huge debt of gratitude for how radically better he made it and without a doubt we are more inspired at Southwest than ever to keep our company strong and keep it growing and to make Herb proud. So everybody look out.","Despite the 2018 challenges we set a number of financial records, I will just underscore the cash, record cash flow, Tammy, I think we had record cash on hand to end the year, record low balance sheet leverage and all that despite almost 7% higher jet fuel prices. And Tammy and Tom and Mike are going to give you all a thorough recap of 2018, so I won't go on any further other than to repeat it was a strong year and a superb finish.","I want to talk about 2019; I'll talk about the government shutdown in a minute. We have a stellar year planned as I told you all in October; our revenue outlook remains superb for the year. We're off to a great start in January, have industry leading forecast, I think first quarter on solid capacity growth and barring anything unforeseen we project unit revenue growth for the year in excess of 3% just like we said back in October.","Got strong traffic, strong yields supported by significantly enhanced revenue management capabilities that were rolled out during 2018. We've got new revenue enhancements committed and under construction as we previously promised and expected to come on line in 2020. Stay tuned for more details later on this year. And no, I am not talking about charging for bags.","Based on our current fuel prices, our unit cost outlook for the year is also quite good. It's under 2%. We have a terrific 70% fuel hedge built for 2019 at a reasonable cost with zero put exposure and dramatic protection say $100 a barrel, we'll have protection below that as well. But it is very dramatic at that level.","Our cost outlook ex-fuel and items for the year is in the 3% to 3.5% range. If we miss that range, it will be because we're below it. And the only caveat and the unforeseen category here is that we do need to hear our capacity target because the denominator is important when it comes to unit costs.","As we said in the release, CASM x is front half loaded for a couple of reasons, Tammy will go over those. The second half is flattish and that bodes well as we get into 2020 and really a good cop to what was a stellar cost performance in 2018. I'll call my good friend Herb Kelleher on the first half next year in terms of cost, which is it's an aberration -- it's an anomaly bordering on an aberration. So regarding our warning back in October about cost it's obviously uncharacteristic for us. Our early indications were simply coming in much higher than we had been previously expecting. We shared that and thanks to our leaders for doing a great job and arriving at a sensible budget for 2019 and committing to a series of initiatives that will drive further efficiencies. Of course, Southwest is famous for being a low cost efficient airline over a long period of time we've been able to control our cost x fuel to 1% to 2% unit growth per annum and that's largely been driven by wage and benefits inflation that everyone here is familiar with.","I don't expect that to change going forward except to say that it is our goal to control inflation to less than 1% to 2% per annum. It's important for a number of reasons that we strive for that but in any event the suggestions by some that our costs are not -- they're out of control or absolutely false.","We've made controlling our costs our number one priority for 2019 and also for the next several years. But I do want to add quickly that we'll also expect to improve our operational performance and our customer service delivery. So we don't -- we don't want to move backwards with those categories.","Over the past 15 years, we've seen a remarkable improvement in our revenue generating capabilities along with a dramatic improvement in our fuel consumption efficiency. Over the last five years, we've seen the best returns on invested capital in our history and it's obviously validates that our investments have more than paid off. So bottom-line 2019 is shaped up as a phenomenal year.","So as for of the government shutdown, I'll sum it up in a word is maddening. And I will also state the obvious here which is that no one can predict what impact it will have if it continues. So all of the bullish comments that I just shared assume that current trends continue or we at least or we abate some of the penalties that we're already incurring. But, everyone needs to be on notice and on guard that this shutdown could harm the economy and it could harm air travel. What I can tell you is that we will do everything that we can to find a way to work through this slop and contain the damage and keep our finances strong.","So with that quick overview, let me turn it over to Mr. Tom Nealon.","Tom Nealon","Okay. Very good. Thank you, Gary. Thank you everyone for joining us.","Well, I'm going to tell you we had used urban gear, we had a very, very strong fourth quarter, you will hear from Tammy in just a few moments. Our cost performance was very strong. We beat our guidance and our revenue performance was also very strong and we came in at the very upper end of our guidance and I do have to say that the entire Southwest family and by the way we are a family. It is a family. You all made it happen. I'm very thankful for each one of you and I appreciate all the hard work that you put in every day.","So we are in fact seeing fourth quarter yield momentum continue into the first quarter and we also continue to see solid passenger demand throughout the booking curve. I think that barring any major changes in the macro environment or a protracted continuation of the government shutdowns gearing over to do, we are set up very well for a strong first quarter and first half RASM performance.","As I said in the October call, Q4 was a clean quarter in terms of year-over-year comps. We had record operating revenues of $5.7 billion which is up 8.5% year-over-year and this was driven by strong performances in both passenger revenues and other revenues. Our load factor was down 0.5 half year-over-year, which was pretty much right in our expectations, while our passenger yields increased 3.7% for the quarter and we saw stable trends across the booking curve including close in, corporate business strength as well as strength in solid holiday performance.","Our average one way fares were up 6.3% for the quarter and our performance was consistent across all of our regions and our yield strength produced a healthy fourth quarter RASM that was up 1.8% year-over-year, which again was near the upper end of our guidance range of plus 1% and 2%. And this is consistent with the original guidance we gave in October and reaffirmed again in December.","I think it's also worth noting that keep in mind this RASM performance was a 6.5% increase in capacity and we also overlapped a plus 2% comp in 2017. So I think that's pretty strong performance.","Our scheduled operating day was down 2% year-over-year in Q4 as we continued eliminating very early and very late shoulder flying which by the way is also consistent what we discussed on our prior calls is reducing our shoulder flying. Our new res system capabilities contributed roughly $95 million EBIT benefit in the quarter, which was above the higher end of our guidance range of $80 million to $90 million and this contributed in a nice way to our yield performance for the quarter. So that puts the res system benefits in $205 million of EBIT for 2018, which is a bit ahead of our plan. And we are very pleased with the performance and capabilities of the new system, we're pleased with how our revenue analysts have adopted it and really embraced it and we'll continue to enhance this and leverage it fully going forward as well.","As we mentioned in our earnings release, we will be ending service to Mexico City later in the quarter, but I have to say that overall we are really pleased with our international business. Although our near international markets are small percent about 4% of our capacity, they were in fact decretive to our Q4 RASM results.","Our international RASM outpaced domestic RASM and that was an almost 8% increase in capacity and these markets are continuing to develop very nicely very much in sync with our plan. The international load factors by the way were also up year-over-year and we saw pretty nice improvement in the performance of the Mexico beach destinations in the quarter.","Having said all that, we don't have any plans to add any additional international this year mainly due to the fact that Hawaii is our top new market, but the RASM performance of our international markets is very strong and we're very pleased.","Our boarding ancillary products also performed well both were up double digits year-over-year and as you might recall in late Q3, we introduced variable pricing for our early bird product. And this is performing right in line if not slightly ahead of our expectations.","Business partner revenues were again strong in Q4 and our Rapid Rewards Program continues to be a strong performer as our co-branded credit card revenue again grew double digits year-over-year in the quarter. And we saw real strength across all metrics of the Rapid Rewards Program and this by the way is an already strong base. So we're seeing strong acquisitions in new ramp Rapid Award numbers, new credit card acquisitions that outpaced passenger growth. You're also seeing strong spending on the card and very high retention rates. So this is a very healthy program. So our industry leading program Rapid Awards continues to perform extremely well. And there is still a lot of runway in front of us for continued growth.","So let me now shift to the first quarter. So based on our current bookings and yield trends we do expect Q1 RASM to increase as you've already heard in the range of 4% to 5% year-over-year. We are seeing a step up in our year-over-year RASM trend and this is largely due to strengthen our base business trends including strength in close-in bookings, strength in corporate travel. As I said just a moment ago strong performance from Rapid Awards.","But in addition to these factors there are several of the things, I do just want to mention real quickly. First on the holiday calendar fronts, we will be shifting as you know Easter from Q1 to Q2. This is about a $40 million revenue shift, but it is a shift. Second, keep in mind that we didn't have any benefit in Q1 last year of our new reservation system. As you recall, this didn't begin to roll out until Q2 last year. The bottom line is, we are expecting a year-over-year RASM benefit in the first quarter about a 0.5 that's pretty solid.","Third, we had a 1.5 RASM headwind last year in the first quarter and this was really driven by several things. First, the suboptimal flight schedule, which we are interested in being done talking about. The competitive fair environment and the spring break calendar shift. So none of those things repeat this year and we see those the 1.5 point tailwind in Q1 of this year.","As you know, we also implement today a system wide fare increase in late November which we expect to be a benefit throughout 2019. So I do want to keep in mind our schedule is now optimized. Our fleet is at full strength and growing. We now have strong revenue management capabilities that we did not have before and we are better prepared to compete in any environment than we were a year ago.","And finally, just like everyone, we are keeping a very close eye on the impact of the government shutdown and we currently estimate $10 million to $50 million negative impact January revenues thus far and that is built into our Q1 RASM guidance. I do think it's important to keep in mind though that a relatively small piece of our business travel is tied to government contracts. So our exposure is relatively low compared to others perhaps but still meaningful and we're keeping a very close eye on this.","I do want to turn to the second quarter for just a moment. We are expecting a healthy year-over-year RASM performance here as well and as based on the current trends as well as on the prior year headwinds that we experienced. As a reminder, we had a 3 point RASM headwind in Q2 last year and two things really drove this. First was that suboptimal schedule again. That was a point. And second, we had a 2 point impact following Flight 1380. Both of those issues are behind us and we see this as a 3 point RASM tailwind for Q2 and we should also see a year-over-year RASM benefit in the second quarter from our res system enhancements.","So to wrap it up. We are very pleased with the revenue trends we're seeing as we start 2019. And our goal is very clear, we will grow RASM this year in excess of 3%. Now, we are off to a great start here in the first quarter.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Van de Ven. Michael?","Mike Van de Ven","Thanks, Tom.","We finished the year with a 79.2% DoT on time performance and that was lower than what we had planned for, but still it was a 1 point, 2 point improvement over 2017. But more importantly, our performance relative to the industry really showed improvement over the last half of the year. We were sixth and seventh in the industry with respect to our on time performance in the first and second quarters. But we improved into fourth place there in the third and fourth quarters. And you know if you exclude Hawaiian out of there of course we'd have been third. The majority of that improvement was the addition of a tool that allows for that our own time performance to be an optimization criteria and the scheduled design. And that added about 1 point of OTP lift in the second half of the year and we did that without having any significant additional operational investments in our block and turn times.","And in fact, if you would look at Southwest on a gauge adjusted basis, we have less block and turn time invested in an on-time performance point than anyone else in the industry. So being near the top of the industry in terms of performance, while maintaining really good asset productivity, it's a very cost effective way for us to fund our reliability targets.","Turning to bag handling for a second. We put over 123 million bags on airplanes 2018. And we delivered 97.1% of them on the flight, as they were tagged. Last year that number rounded to 97.2%. So very consistent bag handling performance in '17 and '18, and those are the best two year performances in our history. We're doing all of that with pencil and paper as our primary tracking and processing tools.","So in 2019, we're investing in scanning and subsequent automation that will be the building blocks for not only improved bag handling, but also improve the efficiency of our flight course procedures. And that again is going to give us an on time performance without any additional block return time investments.","We continue to focus on hospitality efforts in 2018 and we've pushed the last supplemental customer information to our stations so that they can go out and identify customers that we want to recognize or perhaps apologize for the previous bad experience. We've hosted several hospitality summits for our people throughout the year. And those things are certainly making a difference because our complaints to the DoT are down 25% from where they were last year and we have the lowest complaint ratio in the industry last year.","Turning to ETOPS just for a second, a primary operational focus in the near term is getting that ETOPS authorization. Although we have left a tabletop and validation flies that demonstrate our ability to execute our long range navigation and our extensive operational procedures. But until the government shutdown ends, we are at a total standstill. Now you may have heard that there have been additional FAA personnel authorized to return to work, but the work that they can do is limited to safety specific activity and certification of new or expanded operational capabilities, it doesn't fall within that definition and thus the fans bill.","If the shutdown ends within a week, I think we have a reasonable chance of beginning the service in the first quarter of 2019. Otherwise, it will likely be in the second quarter.","And turning to 2019 a little bit further. We do have several other initiatives and technology efforts focused on enabling productivity enhancements. We plan to implement a new maintenance system either late in 2019 or possibly early in 2020. And it's going to provide substantial opportunities to streamline our processes and eliminate some inefficient overhead costs we have associated with our current system.","We're planning to make investments in our crewing systems better connectivity with our crews along with some improved Decision Support Technologies to recover from our regular operations. And we also have more opportunities to continue to incorporate some of more advanced predictive analytics in the NOC and to use that while we're running our daily operations.","So just to close out, I think our operations are on very solid footing as we move into 2019. The operational metrics are right where they need to be. And that gives us more time to focus on the cost opportunities that Gary and Tom have mentioned.","And with that brief update, I will turn it over to Tammy Romo.","Tammy Romo","Right. Thank you, Mike, and hello everyone.","I'm also very pleased with how our people closed out the year strong and fourth quarter. Our 2018 performance truly was the second half story. Our people saw your spirit was on full display as they overcame great challenges last year to produce the outstanding results we reported this morning and we have great momentum coming into this year.","On top of the record fourth quarter revenue performance Tom took you through, we had a solid fourth quarter and full year cost performance despite higher year-over-year fuel prices. We did see some relief in crude prices in the back half of December, which resulted in our fourth quarter hedged fuel price of $2.25 per gallon coming in at the lower end of our mid-December guidance range. However, our market prices in December also provided an opportunity for us to add to our first half 2019 fuel hedge position as well as 2020 with the Brent crude spot price trading in the lowest $50 per barrel range.","We are now 70% hedged for this year with 75% to 85% protection in first half 2019 and a roughly 60% hedged in the second half of the year. For 2020, we are now roughly 50% hedged.","Our hedging premium for this year are approximately 95 million or about $0.04 per gallon compared with 2018's premium expense of 135 million or $0.06 a gallon.","Our 2019 hedging protection produces modest gains at current market prices and kicks in more materially at $70 Brent crude equivalent. Now we're well prepared should we continue to see volatility in prices. And as we've previously mentioned our 2019 hedges are a mix of WTI and Brent crude oil and are structured so that we fully participate in a market price decline.","For first quarter 2019 based on market prices last Friday and given our hedging position, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2 to $2.05 range with an estimated $0.02 hedging gain offset by $0.06 of premium costs.","And for full year 2019, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2 to $2.10 range with an estimated $0.01 hedging gain offset by $0.04 cents of premium costs.","Fuel efficiency improved 1.5% in 2018 and we expect a similar improvement year-over-year in the first quarter and for the full year 2019 in the 1% to 2% range, which is around $60 million in annual fuel savings.","This will continue to be a key part of our cost story going forward, which should become more meaningful as we begin retiring Dash 700s this year and continue taking on more fuel efficient MAX aircraft. Excluding fuel special items and profit sharing, our fourth quarter unit costs were down slightly compared to last year and slightly better than our expectation of flat to up 1%.","As a reminder, fourth quarter 2018 unit costs benefited from a year-over-year tailwind of about 3 point due to fourth quarter 2017's employee tax reform bonus.","For full year 2018, our CASM excluding fuel special items and profit sharing ended right in line with our expectations of flat to up 1% year-over-year.","Our unwavering focus on controlling costs played a significant role in managing cost inflation throughout the year and I'd like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous effort. And I'd also like to thank our team for all the hard work they put into completing our 2019 plan.","We currently expect our full year 2019 CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase in the 3% to 3.5% range year-over-year with the pressure weighted to the first half of this year. For first quarter 2019, we're expecting our unit costs excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase around 6% year-over-year and our second quarter 2019, year-over-year CASM x trend is expected to be similar to first quarter.","For the second half of this year, current cost trends and expectations suggest flat year-over-year unit costs excluding fuel and profit sharing. Our quarterly capacity growth is playing a big part in our first half cost pressure and as you all know, the timing of our Hawaii flying has been delayed and is in flux. And we're incurring Hawaii specific startup costs without the benefit of the flying, which alone is about a 0.5 point penalty in our first half CASM x year-over-year trends.","In addition, we expect first half unit cost pressure from the under-utilization of our fleet due to the timing of Hawaii. This cost pressure should ease as we ramp up our Hawaii flying in the second half of this year. And this was all contemplated in our full year capacity growth guidance no more than 5%.","With respect to our first quarter CASM x year-over-year inflation as we mentioned in this morning's press release, the largest drivers of our 6% year-over-year CASM growth are the underutilization of our fleet due in the first half of the year due to the delay and a lifeline, in addition to higher airport costs and depreciation and the timing of maintenance and technology spend.","As we said on our last call, controlling our costs is a top priority. And as we always have we'll continue our rigorous efforts to contain costs and protect our competitive advantage. Our long-term goal is to contain annual year-over-year growth and our unit costs excluding fuel and profit sharing to below 2% which I believe is reasonable and achievable.","And finally, as a wrap up of our cost discussions, the primary reason on our tax rate for fourth quarter came in closer to 20% is the realization of year end tax credits. We continue to estimate our 2019 tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. And on that note, the lower tax rate certainly was a welcome contributor to our record operating and free cash flow performance in 2013.","We ended the year with ample cash and short-term investments of 3.7 billion with our 1 billion revolver fully available.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we have very manageable debt obligations and capital spending plans for 2019.","In 2018, we invested approximately 1.9 billion into the business, which ended lower than our guidance of 2 billion mostly due to timing. In 2019, we continue to expect a similar level of CapEx spending and the 1.9 billion to 2 billion range as we invest in the future of our airline. We are investing in technology including a new maintenance system which is as significant to the operations side of our business as our new reservation system is the commercial side. And we have airport investments underway particularly at LAX and St. Louis. And we're building a new maintenance hangar in Baltimore. And of course, we have 44 aircraft deliveries this year including 28 new aircraft from Boeing, which I'll cover shortly.","We expect our investments to help drive incremental revenue opportunity as well as support longer term cost objectives as we roll out better tools for employees and more efficient processes and technologies to drive productivity as well as support our long-term growth plans.","Our 2018 free cash flow was a record 3.1 billion and we returned 2.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.","For 2019, we plan to continue our balanced approach to investing in the business and in our employees and with the opportunities to continue providing free cash flow to our shareholders.","Before I close, I'll quickly take you through our fleeting capacity plans. We ended 2018 with 750 aircrafts in our fleet in line with our target and for 2019, we currently have a total of 44 aircraft deliveries which is comprised of seven owned MAX 7, 21-owned MAX 8 and 16 leased MAX 8.","This is 10 more than our previous order book disclosure as we had one December MAX 8 delivery that split into 2019 and we also had 9 additional leased MAX 8 aircraft. These additional 9 leased aircraft are earmarked for this year's fleet replacement needs.","As we mentioned, we'll start retiring some of our oldest Dash 700s this year as we continue with our fleet modernization effort, which will help improve our fuel efficiency, operational reliability and maintenance burden.","Our current plan is to retire around 20 of our Dash 700 this year resulting in about 25 net aircraft additions for 2019 and a year end 2019 fleet of approximately 775 aircraft.","We expect first quarter 2019 capacity to increase in the 3.5% to 4% range year-over-year and for a full year 2019, we continue to expect our available seat miles to increase no more than 5% year-over-year. Our schedule is currently published through early August and this schedule excludes expected Hawaii flying which as we've covered will be added as soon as we can.","Here in a week or so, we'll publish our schedule through the end of September. Excluding Hawaii, our first half 2019 capacity growth is 2.5%. And as a reminder, Hawaii is expected to represent up to half of planned 2019 capacity growth and we're certainly looking forward to providing more capacity to detail once we're able to upload our Hawaii schedules.","In the meantime with our ETOPS process on hold, we have some uncertainty in our capacity plan for this year. So we will take it one schedule at a time for now.","So in closing, despite our challenges in 2018, our employees rose to the occasion time and time again and I thought our execution was very strong. As a quick recap on what we shared today as Tom mentioned, we are starting 2019 with a very healthy RASM outlook. We remain committed to our low fare brand and our revenue management capabilities are as strong as ever. We have been very focused on closing out our 20 19 plan over the past few months. And despite some cost inflation above where we'd like to be this year, I feel really good about our 2019 cost plan and our path to arrest this trajectory going forward. In particular, the much improved cost outlook for second half of 2019.","First and foremost, we want to expand our margins in 2019 and we want to improve our returns on capital. While fuel prices are currently down year-over-year, our improved fuel hedging position for 2019 and 2020 provides even more near-term protection, if oil prices go back up.","We continue to invest in the business and our fleet, facilities and technologies and many of our investments this year will support future growth and scalability of Southwest Airlines as we continue our march to become the world's most loved, most flown and most profitable airline.","In closing, I want to personally thank those of you who reached out to Herb -- to reach out to us to share your personal stories and heartfelt thoughts about Herb to our Southwest family. He really did change the airline industry for the best and now he will be missed greatly. His legacy will live on forever.","And with that Greg, I'll turn it back to you now to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much ma'am. [Operator Instructions] We'll now begin our first question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Hey. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for the time. Gary, I think there was some urgency from you last quarter regarding the cost pressure you were seeing and the need to find more revenue to offset that. I think you mentioned that you were open to alternatives. I mean has that mindset changed because you're now more comfortable with 19 CASM x and then 2020 returning to more normal levels. Can you just maybe update your perspective there? Thank you.","Gary Kelly","Yes. Sure, Joe. To be honest with you, I don't remember exactly the words that I used, but I wouldn't say that anything has changed other than time has gone by. We've firmed up our plan. We've more than sustained our momentum. It's actually improved. And we've told you the truth in October. We're telling you the truth today. We're very excited about 2019.","I think what I must admit was just the desire that we have to keep the pipeline full of new ideas and new initiatives. And in terms of what we have in flight right now, I think we're all very pleased, very encouraged with the changes that we made during 2018. We've got plenty of experience under our belt there. And again, my hat's off to our commercial team, I think they did a phenomenal job and so we feel really good about that and even better about our forecast for 2019 and the benefits that would flow from that.","Beyond that, I think I was clear in October that we weren't contemplating then nor are we contemplating now any new initiatives per se on the revenue front for 2019. All I was doing today is just to reiterate that that as far as 2020 goes and what I first mentioned in July that work is more than an idea. It's a commitment. The construction is underway. Every time that we have relooked at the couple of ideas that we have under construction they look better to us. So I don't think there's anything different in the message today other than we have better visibility more certainty and we're down the road with some of our work. It's been firmed up. We've got a project plan people working on it and we're feeling very good about 2019 and encouraged about our opportunity to continue to augment that momentum in 2020.","Joseph DeNardi","That's helpful Gary. Just two very quick follow ups. I mean, so should I understand that in terms of the ancillary or the revenue initiatives in 2020 that we should just wait to hear what you're planning on doing at this point you're not ready to talk about it. And then, the second one is, you mentioned the fare increase in November as a driver of PRASM. Can you just quantify that somehow, so we can understand how impactful things like that are for your RASM like what it's adding to the first quarter or beyond that? Thank you.","Gary Kelly","I will let Tammy address the latter question on the first part of your question. Yes. It's very straightforward. All we want people to know is that we're not sitting by and assuming that revenues will come to us that we're continually looking for new ideas for -- it's a little early for competitive reasons to share exactly what we want to do. And so, yes, you're going have to stay tuned on that for sometime later in the year when it's more ready for primetime. That will give us a better opportunity to forecast better what we think the benefits will be.","Tammy, you want to talk about the fare increase component?","Tammy Romo","Sure. I'd be happy to do that. And as you all know when you're assuming -- like you're assuming for revenue obviously depends on your assumptions in terms of the impact to traffic, but it kind of all else equal and assuming no dilution in traffic, it could be up to say call it 1%, but then all that's been baked into the guidance that we provide you this morning.","Joseph DeNardi","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","And moving on, from Barclays we have Brandon Oglenski.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Gary or Tom. I mean the revenue outlook here especially in the first half sounds pretty strong. I guess can you talk strategically as JetBlue rolls out their version of basic economy and the majority of the industry goes to this ancillary based pricing structure. Is that strategically what's driving you guys to change some of these initiatives that we have to wait to hear about in 2020? And is it making it more difficult on the forward end of the booking curve to effectively generate the same RASM as your competitors?","Gary Kelly","Great question. Well, Tom, will take this one and you are going to do two. I think short answer is, no. That's not what we are responding to. What we're -- our capabilities evolve over time. Hopefully that means they improve and we see opportunities where we can drive business in greater volumes or more efficiently in terms of the pricing. And that's what we're going after here in the near-term. And I was asked -- I'm asked all the time about basic economy. You're not going to see basic economy from Southwest. That's not what we do. And I already said, we're not going to charge for bag fees. We have we think better opportunities that fit our brand. I love the fact that we're different and they unbundle and we don't. And so we just need to continue to find ways with the universe of travelers and the varying needs that they have to see how we can stay true to our brand and offer something of more value to road warriors to once a year flyers whatever it might be. And I'd say, we have a long list of ideas. And right now, we're going to focus on a couple and they're going to come to market in 2020. Tom?","Tom Nealon","Well, I think all that I'll add to that Gary is, if you think about over time there are some things that we would probably have done sooner, if we were able our prior reservation system, the old SaaS cowboy system just precluded us from doing things that we would have liked to done years ago. Now that we have the foundation of the one res system in, it really does set the foundation for us to do some things that honestly when we talk with you later in the year you're going to think, yes, that makes perfect sense. I would expect you'd done that earlier. Well, we would have, if we could have. Now we can so we will.","So that's the kind of thing you're going to hear us when we are talking about. But, in our ancillary business, if you look at our other our early bird products and things like that these are not inconsequential and they're -- by thinking those are the variable pricing that kind of thing we really do continue to drive strong ancillary performance. So I'm really proud of the product and probably we are and there's capability that we have that we can build upon. So I guess I'll stop, stay tuned for Investor Day then you will talk about some point, right? But that's what it is.","Gary Kelly","And is very quickly on your point about staying competitive, just look at the results. I mean there is no evidence that we are not competitive. In fact there's evidence that we have the best combination of revenues and cost and returns period. So I think we're all very confident about where we stand in our brand and we'll put it up against anybody.","Brandon Oglenski","I appreciate the response no doubt Gary, your returns margins are pretty much leading. But I guess, are we to think then that on the forward booking curve where you are facing competition from the ULCC models, you guys are able to get away with a higher fare structure? Is that true or?","Gary Kelly","Well, our ULCC overlap is gigantic. So I think the results would say, yes. And I'm just pointing back to earlier comments that I made about our enhanced revenue management capabilities. So we're in a better position than ever to compete with low cost, high cost, you name it. And Tom is or has hinted that we were going to use we're leveraging this technology to pursue a couple of new revenue generating ideas. So we got a lot of -- we have a lot of strengths. We have more seats in the United States than anybody else. We have more customers than anybody else. We have the best frequent flyer program. We have a great overall product in terms of the reliability in the on-time performance in the baggage handling. We have the best employees in terms of the hospitality. It is a dynamite package. Nobody can approach matching that combination of strengths. Certainly the ULCCs can't come close to that. And again, as I say we're real confident about where we are. We never want a standstill and we want to keep investing and making improvements.","Brandon Oglenski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon","Hey. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the time. I want to ask you a little bit about the decision to kind of postpone any international growth this year, if you kind of look back the last couple of years opening up international was kind of a growth avenue for you. And I wanted to get a sense for whether this is just a decision to kind of prioritize the organization's focus on Hawaii or whether maybe the opportunities for where you could get to in international markets or maybe getting more developed quicker than you thought? I'm just trying to get a sense for how you're feeling about the potential still in international given that you're taking a pause this year.","Gary Kelly","No. It's the former and we've been clear about that. So we're going to be growing, I think most people think pretty aggressively this year. We've added a lot of airplanes to overcome the retirement of the classic fleet, and then, grow beyond that. So we're at record fleet numbers this year and we'll be adding a net of 25-ish in 2019. So to answer your question, is what do we do with 25 airplanes? And we're going to Hawaii. We're going big that needs to be the focus. And it kind of crowds out expansion in other areas like international. Tom gave a quick summary of the international performance as we saw it here in the fourth quarter. And taking a little breather there right now is allowing a really good unit revenue development. So that's all fine. But we have vast opportunities to grow internationally. And were it not for Hawaii, we would absolutely be adding some more international routes and augmenting some of our flying. So it's simply a matter of prioritization and Hawaii, I think deserves that kind of prioritization is that big of an opportunity.","David Vernon","And then, new opportunities to maybe repurpose some of the -- some equipment from underperforming domestic routes into maybe International. That would be a little bit more attractive. Like how do you guys think about making that balance [indiscernible] there?","Gary Kelly","Well, that's just you do that every day. So, yes, we're pruning. And in fact that will be part of our cost initiatives that we talked about back in October is evolving our route strategy so that not only is it more commercially viable, but it also is more customer friendly in terms of recovery if we have late flights. And that should help our cost performance. So we are always doing those kinds of things. We have a very complicated network. There are infinite solutions as to how we route our aircraft and that is one of the inputs. But, yes, the answer is absolutely obviously we're always doing that and we like where we are with the route system as it is right now. But we'll continue to prune it as we go forward.","David Vernon","All right. Thank you. And then, maybe just one quick follow-up on the LaGuardia and Reagan. Can you give us a sense for when the timing of those [indiscernible] from Alaska is going to kick in and whether or not that capacity that would be going into those gates is in the -- ASN got already?","Gary Kelly","You're testing my memory, but I believe it's in the fall, in the November time period of 2018. It's already going in.","David Vernon","So those gates are already being utilized.","Gary Kelly","Those flights are in place and performing well. We've also moved LaGuardia is undergoing this massive makeover and we've moved to our new facilities so that's been very serendipitous for us to get really good real estate at the same time that we're adding flights. So all that's going really well also.","David Vernon","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, from JPMorgan we have Jamie Baker.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good afternoon everybody. First question on Hawaii and Tammy, sort of touched on and saying that Hawaii could constitute half of this year's growth. But, I'm curious with the ETOPS delay relative to your initial expectations, is that possibly sort of working to your advantage and so far as the non ETOPS related preparations are obviously still taking place in the background, so does that imply that when you do finally start service you can ramp up more quickly than plan. In other words, if the cadence was originally to add and I'm making this up, I don't know, three nonstop routes per quarter. So you'd be doing 12 after a year. If you don't start flying until the second quarter, could you still get to the year end plan in less time because of the delay that you're currently taking or does it not work that way.","Gary Kelly","Well, that was probably a better question for Mike. So Jamie are you coming at it more from an operational build up as opposed to a commercial ramp up.","Jamie Baker","Well, both, presumably had you started service in the fourth quarter of last year, if you were flying it now, you'd have a plan in place for the fourth quarter of this year. As the date slips, does the fourth quarter plan come down or can you ramp more quickly because you're basically just twiddling their thumbs at this point n offense waiting for the government to get its act together.","Mike Van de Ven","So Jamie, this is Mike. In terms of Hawaii, when you think about all the other non-ETOPS things our staff is ready, our procedures are ready, our gates are ready, our equipment is ready. We're ready to go with that. The only taking item we have with ramp up is making sure that as we ramp up, we have an adequate number of pilots trained for ETOPS flight. And so, I would tell you that the slow to ramp up over the first three to six months is probably what it is. And then after that we have as many -- we don't have any constraints really after that.","Gary Kelly","And just philosophically, Jamie, we're going to be conservative. So this is -- there is a certification process for a reason and I think what I just underscore what Mike just said. We're going to want to go at a pace that we're comfortable with. And I don't think we will be at the same place at the end of the year that we would have been Mike had we started that's February 1, in terms of flying. But at the same time in the grand scheme of things, we're going to get there and is not talking about years delay and we are commercial folks have other purposes for -- relative to the earlier question.","There are plenty of places that we can put airplanes and that is one advantage we have as an airline. We can move the airplanes around and our people are very resilient and they're willing to do temporary duty in other locations. So it's sloppy and we've admitted that and it's reflected in our first half numbers. Even with that, we're still looking at a really a stellar year and other than that nothing is changed.","The nice thing is, the FAA has approved our program. It is ready to go. All we have to do now is demonstrate to them that we can execute our program. And so that the line of sight to getting to the certification is pretty darn sharp and the FAA is really anxious to get their part of this work done too. It's just a shame that we are where we are with the shutdown.","Jamie Baker","Sure, sure. That's very helpful color and it wasn't -- I didn't mean to insinuate that it was -- that Southwest was to blame for the delay here. And second, as I'm sure you're aware competitive growth in secondary cities is running quite a bit ahead of what's taking place in the major markets. Obviously, United is driving some of that constraint with the hubs also a contributing factor. But anytime I think secondary cities, I obviously thanks Southwest. So is it safe to assume that in terms of year-on-year RASM, your larger markets are outperforming the secondary cities or would that be a stretch?","Gary Kelly","Well, I -- you know us so well, so I don't know that I'm trying to debate the point, but I don't think of Southwest as a secondary city airline, 100% of our customers flow through our top -- I don't know 10 airports. So we're a big city airline. And in other words, we don't, just using your words, secondary, we don't go non-stop secondary to secondary. We know in recent years as an example, we've added non-stops from San Antonio, let's say to Kansas City, we're the number one airline in each city. I would certainly not refer to them as secondary. They're very substantial cities. We've got a lot of fans in both and those are very successful flights.","So I don't know as I remember we've got 85 -- 48 states cities and they're in the top 85. And in fact, we try to avoid the smaller cities because we fly as you well know, we fly 737s and we just don't generate enough volume compared to what we could do in other locales. So I think the net answer is, we're used to competition. I mean that's not going to go away. That will continue to make us better. And we're just continuing to play to our strengths and continue to expand strategically in a way that plays to our strengths.","Jamie Baker","Strong answers to both questions. Thanks gentlemen.","Operator","And moving on, from Morgan Stanley we have Rajeev Lalwani.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good afternoon, Gary. Hi.","Gary Kelly","Hi.","Rajeev Lalwani","Gary a couple of questions for you on the CASM side. First, can you just walk us through the steps you took and the mitigants you pursued to kind of bring costs down to 3%, 3.5%? What sort of labor impact you have on those numbers? And then, secondly, it seems like in the back half of the year, you're going to be kind of flattish on unit costs. Why isn't that a good run rate to use going forward, is it, labor that can disrupt out a bit and maybe get you closer to 2% sort of that longer term targets, give us some thoughts there on sort of this year and then longer term?","Gary Kelly","Well, Tammy, I might let you, Mike and Tom kind of talk about how we got from there to here. It's just I don't know there was anything real fancy. What was a little fancier was putting together cost initiatives that all of our leadership agreed and committed to which is a little bit more of a longer project. But going through the annual budget is a grind. And as I admitted in my comments earlier, it was coming in much higher than what I was expecting. And we fessed up and told you all that. And I think our folks have done a nice job in trimming that back. But your point about 2020 is a good one. And I will admit to you that's exactly where my mind will start in terms of the expectations for 2020 is something that's flat on a run rate basis. But it's -- but I will also admit to you that it's a little too early to tell. And until we -- the devil can be in the details and we definitely want to have more confidence that that is in fact to run rate before we just put these bold statements out there. But we're 1% to 2% inflation over a long period of time. And this is a very efficient company to begin with and we have invested significantly in driving more revenue and driving more fuel efficiency. So I'm proud of that. And that's what you should expect from us going forward is on an annualized basis over a long period of time no more than 1% to 2%, our goal as I said is to now bring that lower. Our aspirational goal among our leadership is to keep unit cost flat.","And so I can assure you with the cost initiatives that are underway that will be the expectation of the goal going into 2020. But it's far too early to tell you that that is our forecast for the year. But, Tammy, you want to color a little bit, how we got from there to here?","Tammy Romo","Sure. And I'd be happy to do that. And I do want to remind everybody on the last call, we were early in our planning which there is normally a lot of scrubbing that we do when we get the original submissions on our annual plan. What now clearly the inflation and the reason we talked about that was because it was more than certainly what we were expecting and obviously what we had indicated to you all.","So I think the important point and takeaway today is that the guidance that we've shared with you, obviously, it was higher than 3.5% when we started the journey and through a combination of scrubbing our costs and changes we have made some tweaks to our schedule in the second half. And we have continued to fleet modernization, which we've also fine tune our plans there. We landed on the range that we provided here to you today.","So as I mentioned earlier, we picked up some more airplanes and so that's we certainly expect to see some improvement from the fleet modernization effort. So really right now we're focused on execution this year and obviously already working on improvements beyond 2019.","So, and again, I'll just remind you that we're back on a better CASM x trajectory in the second half of this year, which is around flat year-over-year. So we'll continue making tweaks to our schedule to balance our operation efficiency with our commercial opportunity. So I think that's the more significant opportunity here in the second half of the year. And as Mike mentioned and I covered a little bit, we're currently investing in operational technology projects and those should provide better tools to help us improve staffing efficiency and just allow our employees to eliminate pain points from their daily processes.","So as we look ahead just -- those are some of the types of initiatives that we have time in our bag of tricks here. And as we work to just ensure that we hit the trajectory that we've shared with you today. So that's really probably the main point I want to point out. Anyone else technically.","Gary Kelly","Tammy, we want to make sure that everyone understands that -- I don't know if happy is the right word, but I am not satisfied with unit cost growth in 2015 of 3% to 3.5%. So don't get us wrong. We were taking corrective action. Right now that's what we -- that's what we're facing. And we've had plenty of years in our history where we've had 3% unit cost growth and it's just going to be one of those years, but that is certainly not what you should extrapolate going forward we expect a lot more research for this.","Tom Nealon","So Tammy and Gary talked about, how we feel about 2019. We'll work to hit that plan and we hit plans. Let me talk about beyond 2019 and how we're thinking about really the 2020 and beyond kind of cost thinking. I guess I think it's really important to start with -- so where are we starting from? And we are one of the most efficient airlines in the world by the way. So we are very, very efficient. But, we do have opportunities and I think that you'll be at some point, I do want to take you through this, we want to take you through this. But there -- we're working on things you'd expect us to be working on.","Just an example, we fly over 4000 flights a day and every day you do have your regular operations. Well, your regular operations by definition are inherently inefficient. So what can we do to drive efficiency in recovering the network, right, during a weather outage or whatever it is. So there is work going on, but just that that is an example adjusting that network very, very modestly transparent to the customer, net neutral to the revenue, the whole thing, just modest tweaks to things like that filter across the operations. So driving out inefficiency is how we're thinking about this. This is not just pruning things. This is really thinking about the broader big processes that we use drive the operation. So in 2019, we're going to drive the budget, we are going to drive the efficiency we need, 2020 and beyond are bigger themes actually. And that's how we're thinking about it.","Gary Kelly","And just one other thing very quickly just to remind everybody what's driving the 3%, 3.5%. It's a couple of basic things, significant airport projects and investments around the country. Number two, a heavier aircraft maintenance burden that is manifesting in 2019. Number three, we are seeing a step-up in depreciation from deployment of more aircraft and also the deployment of technology projects. So one of the things that we did for 2019 is, we said let's just make sure that we are taking into account the benefits that should flow through our cost structure of a lot of these investments that are being deployed. And that was a lot of the improvement that we saw since October.","I guess in the interest of time we ought to move on to our next question.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take that last question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Thanks for getting me on. I was wondering if you might be surprised to compare your outlook for some of these Hawaii markets with BWI Oakland, which is kind of a high load factor low yield market. But the point of sale makes it obviously is going to be very different. I was wondering if you might think in time if given these factors, the RASM performance in Hawaii can be in line or better than how you do in that market? Thank you.","Gary Kelly","That is a great question. And I'm going to sidestep it a little bit under because I don't like to talk about individual specific markets and their profitability. We just always had a tradition of maintaining our thoughts sort of in a proprietary way about that setting the comparison aside for a second. All of the forecast that we have done from a very significant point of strength in California to Hawaii have been exceptional. So I'm expecting that they will perform like a typical startup initially and develop quickly and be very, very satisfactory performers, point number one.","What we were I think pleasantly surprised with is when we were urged to contemplate inter island flying which when we first revealed in October of 2017 that we were going to Hawaii, we were not thinking that. Once we looked at that, we were pleasantly surprised how it forecast as well. And so I think on both aspects of that business the mainland to the islands, and then, the inter island both forecast well. And based on our experience with forecasting and understanding our customers and our markets and the competitive dynamics we feel very, very good about the viability of that. Or else we wouldn't have made the choice and the judgment to ramp that up very quickly. We would have been much more cautious.","So we're putting our money where our mouth is and in any event as you know the exposure is limited. I think Hawaii builds up to be a point Tom or something like that of our capacity. But that's sort of a backhanded way of saying we're bullish about it. I don't intend it that way. We're going to have a very viable schedule. We have a lot of customers who are huge fans of Southwest that we're confident will get on board. Hawaii is a huge destination which is you have to take that into account when you do the comps to other markets of comparable distance. And we're going to do well is the bottom line and while we continually update our forecast, our judgment about this opportunity has been unchanged.","Hunter Keay","Just real quick in for you Gary. You said look out in the beginning of the call, it was interesting it jumped out at me. Who were you talking to?","Gary Kelly","Whoever is listening. It's been an emotional experience for our company to lose someone like Herb. And I can't remember whether you ever had the opportunity to meet him, but the impact he had on people is absolutely profound. And you get on a Southwest Airlines airplane and everybody feels like they know him. Everybody feels like they that he loves them and people are inspired. So there's just no stopping us. And it's all about our people in terms of making this airline work and they are as inspired as ever and they're the ones who win these customers, they're the ones who win the Fortune Most Admired and just on and on and on and it comes from the heart. And there is no company in the world that that is like this. So whoever wants to get in our way better look out.","Hunter Keay","I got you. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Ryan Martinez","I think that's a great way to wrap up there. Thank you for all the questions. That concludes our analyst call and of course if you have any additional questions please give me a ring. And thank you for joining us today.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.","Linda Rutherford","Thank you, Greg and I like to welcome the members of the media to our call today. I will jump right into the Q&A portion. Greg if you don't mind just refreshing them on how they can tee up for a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Absolutely ma'am [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.","Q - Alison Sider","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You talked a lot about the shutdown -- the impact of the shutdown at a high level. I was wondering if you might be able to give us a sense of whether it's becoming a problem for safety, for operations whether you're seeing any kinds of delays either in the airports or in air?","A - Gary Kelly","Well, thanks Alison. I'd like for Mike to have a chance to answer that too. But I think the bottom line is, no. Tammy and Ryan put in the press release the dollar impact that we've seen and that's pretty specific to government travel. And that's something that we're comfortable that we can estimate. You use the word safety. It is safe and it will be safe. I think the risk is that things slow down in order to retain a safe operating environment. That's both from an air traffic perspective as well as an airport perspective.","So I am so proud of our FAA and TSA employees. I feel like they are doing a phenomenal job. They shouldn't have to endure this. And I think our whole country should offer their thanks to them for keeping the airlines running. Our business is one that is intimately tied in with federal government. The federal government touches every single customer that goes through the airport and they touch every single flight that we have and it goes beyond just those things. But so far the operation Mike has been actually superb since the beginning of the year. But what would you like to answer.","A - Mike Van de Ven","I think you did all the high points, I agree with what he said no matter what it will be safe. It's just whether or not the volume of activity can keep pace with all the different staffing whether it's TSA or air traffic controllers or things like that. And so I do things that longer that it goes more risks that we have that maybe there are longer waiting times at checkpoints that had to wait -- taxiing times may lengthen, your in-flight times may change maybe a little bit longer trial between the airplanes. So those are the kinds of things that I think we ought to be about.","A - Gary Kelly","And again, also to be clear, we're not saying that. In fact, Mike's operation the on-time performance is better this year than it was a year ago so far. So things so far knock on wood are going just fine. So this is all conjecture. But those are the things that we're all worried about and this thing just can't go on. I feel the FAA has made a good point about what is the impact right now. Well, they are not allowed to hire anybody if they did they wouldn't do any good because they're not allowed to train anybody. And so they already have a hard time keeping their air traffic control positions filled. And it takes years of experience to develop proficiency and this was harmful. So we know at some point down the road there'll be some harm, some way, somehow. But this is crazy. It just absolutely needs to end. And if it left as it is, it will harm the economy. It will harm air travel.","I don't know -- what impacts are on other industries, but these are important jobs or they wouldn't be there. The notion that they're not essential is absurd, they're all essential. And so it just the sooner than later, but right now knock on wood everything is running remarkably well and that's a real tribute to the federal government employees.","Q - Alison Sider","Are you hearing any concerns from your crew, from pilots or flight attendants, are they coming to you with any worries about sort of the robustness of the system?","A - Gary Kelly","I've never heard one Mike, any Tammy, Tom, no. Never heard one. I think in fact, I would bet you and you're welcome to talk to anybody who will talk to you. I bet you will hear the same thing that you heard from me, which is that people are there and they're working hard. I think anytime I see anybody I thank them for their hard work and so should you when you travel.","Q - Alison Sider","We will do. Thanks.","Operator","Moving on, we have Tracy Rucinski with Reuters.","Q - Tracy Rucinski","Hi, there. Again on the shutdown, so far there aren't any signs of Washington reaching an agreement to reopen. Is there anything that the airline industry can do or is doing to force an end to the deadlock?","A - Gary Kelly","I think the short answer is no. As you would expect, the industry aligned with many other industries has communicated to leadership in the federal government. The risk of continuing this and the harm that can be done so absent that. What else can be done. And we're going to do everything that we can to find ways to mitigate this and not simply sit here and be victims about this. But in the end this is -- we're dealing with a monopoly. So we don't have the choice to go to someone else to provide our traffic services or our security services. It's just not available to us and it shouldn't work this way, but it does. So in the meantime, we just need to have cool heads and attend to our business as best we can and we're determined here that we're going to have a very good year in 2019 no matter what. And we'll do our best to work through this slop.","Q - Tracy Rucinski","Thanks. And just a minor question again about the timing of Hawaii. You said that a chunk of your first quarter unit costs were due to start up costs from Hawaii. If it's that one does end up rolling over into the second quarter. Will there be an additional unforeseen cost impact?","A - Tammy Romo","Yes. This is Tammy. Yes. That continues into the second quarter there will absolutely be a continued cost impact. And obviously, it depends on the duration there.","A - Gary Kelly","But that's pretty much factored into your --","A - Tammy Romo","That's all in our guidance.","A - Gary Kelly","That's all in.","Q - Tracy Rucinski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we will hear from FlightGlobal we have Ghim-Lay Yeo.","Q - Ghim-Lay Yeo","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow up about Hawaii. I know you plan to start in Thailand flying probably shortly after you get the FAA approvals to begin a Hawaii service. How soon afterwards can you actually launched into [indiscernible] flying has that timeline shifted at all, no, that you are not exactly sure when Hawaii services actually start.","A - Gary Kelly","Mike, you want to talk about that.","A - Mike Van de Ven","Yes. So when we first start up to Hawaii, we're just going to be focused on the mainland to Hawaii and flying for a period of time. And then, not launch into the entire island the final publicly probably after leaving a couple of months of service before we get into the inter island flying.","A - Gary Kelly","But I think what Mike had planned is, we got our approval from the FAA for our program by the end of December and that was a huge accomplishment. I was very proud of our folks and very thankful to the FAA. They worked hard to get there. All that was left during the month of January and Mike had all this scheduled, they had dates scheduled. They had the task scheduled, was to validate for the FAA that we knew our program and that we could handle different scenarios that would be posed. All that led to a schedule that assuming everything was passed if you will that we would be selling next week. And Mike had planned, once we started selling that we would be flying sometime in February. So now he is going to roll this.","So if we get started, again, with the FAA let's say February 1, I think you can roughly allow a month and then we would be able to get our certificate and sell, and then we would be flying in the following month. And it just rolls. So with that that's roughly the amount of time that we're going to need from the time that we get back on task until we fly. So it's somewhere or no homie to this because it will still depend, but it's somewhere around six to eight weeks. I would say from the time that he starts working with the FAA to finish to the time that we would be flying.","And then Mike has to publish schedules for his flight crews and that is on a monthly cadence so it's -- so that's it. Anyway that should give you some rough idea. I think it is possible if we get started quickly that we could be flying in March. We don't see a path to flying in February. It's too late for February but we could be flying in March. But we don't start with the FAA units, part one it's going to be April. So that's kind of a rough road.","A - Mike Van de Ven","So it is just to play out through that and the launch in mainline service to one location, we will have mainline service to a second location and then as we get more Hawaii locations out there we have more options than to connect that inter island flying and that's what I will launch with the mainland service first and follow on with the other flying.","Q - Ghim-Lay Yeo","Sure. And I have a separate question about the Mexican city. Are you able to see a little bit more wider than was it mostly because corporate in mind and materialize, has there been any self implements from what's been going on with the Mexican city airport situation.","A - Gary Kelly","Right now. Our focus is primarily on destinations from our strong points in the U.S. The better performing destinations for us right now or the leisure destinations. Mexico City, we are showing very nice improvement. It's more much more of a business market and given where we are right now we just have better opportunities in terms of deploying that capacity. I'd love for us to be back in Mexico City one of these days. Tom and his team are working on better commercial capabilities in terms of marketing and foreign countries accepting foreign currency and all of those things are futures, which certainly support service to a place like Mexico City better than what we have today. But we just have better alternatives. And like I said hopefully we'll be back in Mexico City one of these days. Our priority right now obviously is adding Hawaii service.","Q - Ghim-Lay Yeo","Sure. Thank you for your time.","Operator","Next question will come from David Koenig with The Associated Press.","Q - David Koenig","Hi. Gary I think I heard you say that Southwest has communicated your concern about the shutdown to government. But if I heard that if I understood that correctly, anything you can say about who you have talked to especially any of their principals in the White House or Congress?","A - Gary Kelly","We have -- as a part of the Trade Association. The trade association has communicated on all of our behalves. And off the top of my head, I don't remember who was on that list but I'm sure it was a long list of officials that received that communication.","Q - David Koenig","Okay. And have you gotten any feedback on what they heard. What was the response from the people that they talked to. I assume they are talking about A4A then?","A - Gary Kelly","I'm talking about A4A and I don't recall any response.","Q - David Koenig","Okay.","A - Gary Kelly","I've seen nothing -- I've seen no response in writing, I'll put it that way.","Q - David Koenig","What can you and I mean the airline industry do that you haven't done yet?","A - Gary Kelly","I think all we can continue -- is to reach out to members of Congress, reach out to leadership, reach out to the White House and there are -- I can assure you there are ongoing opportunities for us to do that and we will.","Q - David Koenig","All right. Thanks.","Operator","We have time for one more question. We'll last here from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly.","Q - Robert Silk","Good afternoon guys.","A - Gary Kelly","Hi. Good afternoon.","Q - Robert Silk","[indiscernible] one of the ones that reported the drone on approach to Newark a couple days ago. How big of an issue of a concern is it for Southwest and other airlines obviously, the FAA moved quickly on new rules relating to drones that will make it easier for airports for them to be tracked and also to detect them and potentially disable them.","A - Gary Kelly","Rob, are you still there? Robert.","Q - Robert Silk","Did you not hear me?","A - Gary Kelly","Yes. I think so. We got you.","Q - Robert Silk","I hear you all. I asked about drones, do I need to repeat the question?","A - Gary Kelly","No, no. We got it.","A - Mike Van de Ven","I'm not -- this is Mike. I'm not familiar with a near a Southwest Airlines flight, in a drone opportunity if I can. But just generally speaking whether it is bird and bird strikes or drones or any other type of activity the airline industry is interested in making sure that the airspace especially above the airports coming into those critical times are well regulated and maintained. So the industry is very supportive of having some type of regulatory requirements and oversight for drones having them registered, having them have certain requirements in terms of their operations trying to limit their availability especially in critical airspace close to the airport. And I know that the FAA is focused on that.

My name is Tom and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and the replay will be available on the Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ryan.","Ryan Martinez - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Tom, and I want to welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman of the Board and CEO, and Gary will kick us off with a few opening remarks. We have Tammy Romo, our Executive Vice President and CFO, who will provide an overview of our financial performance and outlook. Tom Nealon, our President, will cover revenue trends and outlooks; and Mike Van de Ven, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide an update regarding Flight 1380.","A few disclaimers before we get started. Today's call will include forward-looking statements based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections. A variety of factors could cause actual results to be materially different. We will also include references to non-GAAP results, which excludes special items. You can reference this morning's earnings release for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP results.","And I also want to note that the company adopted three new accounting standards effective January 1, 2018. Certain prior-year financial information has been recast to reflect the adoption of these new standards. And for more information, please reference our Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on March 20. You can find our earnings release and our SEC filings on the Investor Relations section of Southwest.com. And following our prepared remarks, we will open it up for questions.","So at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. And I am pleased to have the opportunity to update our shareholders on a couple of important matters. I want to start by sharing that our priority remains supporting and caring for all of those that were affected by Flight 1380 last week and, of course, in particular, the family and loved ones of Jennifer Riordan. She was an extraordinary person and, of course, we all mourn her passing. It was a dark day, but the compassion and concern and support since the event have been truly extraordinary and it just touches your soul.","Our five-person flight crew, led by Captain Tammy Jo Shults, performed magnificently. Our Ground Operations Team in Philadelphia threw themselves into the task of supporting all of the customers on that flight, which took many hours. And on behalf of Southwest Airlines, I want to thank all of our competitors who came to our customers' aid that day. There were many, but I especially want to thank American Airlines. And finally, I want to thank the selfless customers who heroically pitched in to help while the flight was being diverted to Philadelphia.","In the aftermath, we had many teams that have sprung into action for support of our customers and our employees, for that matter, as well as the NTSB. We have an equal priority, and that is ensuring that there are no blades with metal fatigue. And our tech-ops team working with GE, CFM, Boeing and the FAA have truly led the industry through new inspection protocols, and for us, it dates back to 2016. So last week, we accelerated the inspections. They are going well. I've been very pleased with the preliminary findings, which reveal no cracks or fatigue.","We're working with GE, CFM and the FAA very closely to ensure we're in full compliance of CFM's service bulletins as well as the FAA's Emergency Airworthiness Directive that was issued last Friday, and we continue to work with and support, of course, the NTSB in their investigation of this event. We have multiple tasks underway, and I want to assure you that the Southwest team is up to the task.","And the next priority I want to cover is our business. Our first quarter results were very solid, despite it not being our best revenue performance, but it was still solid. Strong margins, excellent cost performance, strong return on capital, strong free cash flow, and shareholder returns makes for the second-best earnings per share for a first quarter in our history.","The booking softness that we mentioned in the press release since last week is predictable, and excluding that effect and taking into account the Easter timing shift away from this year's second quarter, the sequential trends look pretty normal to me. Regardless, our revenue plan this year has always been a second-half story, and we've implemented better revenue management techniques already in first quarter to manage against overly aggressive discounting. And we have several major enhancements to revenue management taking effect midyear relating to our new reservation system that you all are already aware of.","And of course, finally, we will be optimizing our flight schedule roughly every 60 days as the second half unfolds. And the bottom line of all this is demand has been strong. It remains strong. Tax reform should help that. Our outlook is positive, and the prospect of record non-GAAP earnings per share is very much alive.","A couple of other notable items in the release. We announced four Hawaii destinations: Honolulu, Kona, Maui, and Lihue, and our Hawaii work remains on track. And we announced firming up 40 more MAX 8 options from the 2026-2027 time period, moving them to ten per year starting in 2019. This is first and foremost an extension of our fleet modernization strategy. We have a very strong business case to replace older 737-700 aircraft, given the superior economics of the MAX 8. The tax reform benefit for Southwest makes this capital investment more feasible, and of course I want to thank Boeing for their support in making that happen.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tammy Romo to elaborate further on our first quarter results.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Gary, and thank you all for being on our call today. I also want to express my gratitude for our employees and how they pulled together to take care of our customers and each other during incidents like last week's accident. That's what families do in difficult times, and I am very proud to work alongside all of our compassionate and caring people.","This morning, we reported a strong first quarter performance with net income, excluding special items of $438 million, up 22% year-over-year, and our earnings per share was $0.75, up an exceptional 29% year-over-year and $0.01 above consensus. Our operating margins was a solid 11.8%, in line with first quarter last year. And our net margin was 8.9%, an improvement from first quarter 2017, 7.4%, as we begin to realize significant savings from the lower corporate tax rate.","Our pre-tax ROIC was 27.1%, or 20.8% on an after-tax basis for the 12 months ended March 31. Our first quarter revenue performance was right in line with our previous guidance. Our cost performance was better than expected, and that's primarily due to some spins shifting into second quarter with a solid cost outlook for the year.","While we are off our plan here in the first half of the year, the benefits from our new reservation system are ramping up in the second quarter with more significant benefits coming in the second half. We also expect the pressure from our sub-optimal schedule to recede in third quarter as we overcome our fleet deficit from our Classic retirement last fall.","Based on everything we know so far, we expect our second quarter year-over-year unit revenue performance to be a bottom for the year, and we will keep after our goal to have positive unit revenues in the quarters ahead. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we had another quarter of very strong operating cash flow, allowing for $648 million of shareholder returns during the first quarter.","And as we continue to modernize our fleet, we still have manageable capital spending this year of $2 billion to $2.1 billion. With strong first quarter margins under our belts along with benefits coming online from our new reservation system, a great fuel hedge that provides meaningful protection in a rising fuel environment and benefits from tax reform, we are well-positioned to achieve our goal to expand our 2018 net margin year-over-year excluding special items.","And with that brief overview, I'll turn it over to Tom to walk you through our revenue trends and outlook.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Okay. Thank you, Tammy, Good morning, everyone. So let me start off with our Q1 performance and I'll jump right into Q2. So as you know, we had record operating revenues of $4.9 billion in the first quarter, which was driven by record passenger revenues of $4.6 billion. We also had very strong performance in Other revenues, which were up 19% year-over-year.","And this is a combination of strength in our EarlyBird and Upgraded Boarding products, both of which were up double digits for the quarter, as well as the continued strength in growth of our Rapid Rewards program and business partner revenues, which are both performing very well. And we also had, as you know, a record load factor of 81.5% for the concluded first quarter. So having said all that, our revenues grew right in line with our ASM growth of 1.8%.","So, as we shared our 8-K last month, there were several factors that caused us to update our RASM guidance for the quarter, and I want to hit on those real quickly. The first factor was our March RASM trends, which were off for the first 20 days of March, and this was largely the results of the spring break calendar shift, which reduced travel demand more than we anticipated. This resulted in a little less than 1 point of negative impact to RASM.","Having said that though, we finished March very strong with very strong RASM performance, and strong load factors. In fact, during the last 11 days in March, we saw our yields grow in the mid-single-digit range year-over-year. And in particular, as Tammy said, the Easter calendar shift from April to March gave us a benefit of roughly $40 million.","The second factor we called out in our 8-K was our sub-optimal flight schedule and I think you all understand this. But as you know, we're in the middle of a fleet transition, which means that we had fewer planes to fly in the schedule, which then means that we're extending the day and doing more flying early in the morning and later into the night, and this generally results in lower yields. But just to be clear, these flights are still profitable and they contribute to the overall network profitability. But there was, in fact, a negative RASM impact for the quarter. And as Tammy said, you'll begin to see this recede in the third quarter as new aircraft come into service.","And the final factor was the competitive fair environments. And on this one, I want to speak specifically to California, which is, obviously, a very competitive market, and we've been competing very aggressively, and we will continue to do that. You all know that we have a very strong market position in California. And, in fact, we have a 63% intra-Cal market share and a 26% market share for all commercial air travel, which includes international in and out of California.","We've added a fair amount of capacity into California and even with our additional flights, we've been able to increase our load factors and we're getting new first time Southwest customers. It is, in fact, impacting our RASM. But we have low costs, low fares, high load factors and strong operating margins. We are generating strong profits and we're gaining new customers, and that's not a bad formula. We are very well prepared to compete, and we will succeed. The combined RASM impact of the sub-optimal schedule in the fare environment was roughly 1 point of RASM for the quarter.","So, that's Q1. Now let's talk about Q2. At the macro level, we are seeing strong demand, as Gary suggested, pretty much throughout the quarter and it tends to be across all regions. Now having said that, I think that we have several unique factors that are impacting our second quarter RASM and it gets us to a guide of down 1% to 3%. And the first, as you'd expect, is the impact of Flight 1380. We are forecasting lost revenue to be in the range of 1% to 2% in terms of RASM for the quarter.","And just for context, in the first week since the accident, we've seen somewhere between 0.5 point and a 1 point of RASM decline so far. That was skewed towards close-in bookings that will be very tough for us to recover. But we're also seeing an impact on travel for May and beyond. So, the full revenue impact isn't totally clear, but we do expect there would a continued impact for some period of time.","Now keep in mind, last Tuesday, we turned off all of our marketing immediately upon the accident. And that included all television, all emails, all paid search, all paid display, all paid social, everything. And that's pretty significant. Those marketing vehicles drive a lot of traffic to Southwest.com. And we only began to slowly bring our marketing back up this past weekend. But as we went back into the market, we did begin to see traffic to Southwest.com ramp back up, but it is not yet back to normal levels. And I think that with an event like this, this is pretty much what I'd expect to see. Traffic will rebound, but it's not there yet.","The second factor I want to hit on is the continued impact of the shoulder flying that I covered in Q1 update. And it's really the same thing. We will have this with us throughout the second quarter, but we will begin to see that diminish in the third quarter as we bring new planes into service. And the third factor is the ongoing competitive environment in California. As I said, we are generating strong profits and we are well prepared to compete and we will succeed financially and with our Southwest customers.","Now on the other side of the equation, we're also still on track to see $40 million to $50 million of benefit in the second quarter from our new res system, as we discussed in the past. And we continue to feel very confident that we'll capture $200 million annual benefit that we discussed with you in the past.","So while we are clearly off of our revenue plan for the first half of 2018, the second quarter is the bottom in terms of our year-over-year RASM trends. Things will begin to kick in and improve in the second half of the year. We'll begin to get our fleet back in balance with our new aircraft deliveries. We'll begin to re-optimize the schedule with the new aircrafts and we'll see the increasing benefit with the reservation system.","And as you expect from Southwest Airlines, we are very focused on solid earnings, solid margins and strong returns in the second quarter. So, we are very optimistic, and with that, Tammy, I'm going to turn it back to you.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Tom. Turning to fuel, our first quarter 2018 economic fuel price per gallon of $2.09 included a $0.05 hedging gain from settled contracts and a $0.07 hedging premium cost. There was a lot of volatility during the first quarter, but actual market prices ended up being down only slightly from original expectations in January.","Looking ahead to second quarter, based on market prices and our hedging portfolio as of April 20, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.20, including an estimated $0.07 hedging gain and a $0.06 hedging premium cost. And for full year 2018, we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.15 to $2.20 range. And that includes an estimated $0.06 hedging gain and a $0.06 hedging premium cost.","Our 2018 fuel hedge position are producing modest gains at current Brent crude market prices with more material gains that kick in at $80 per barrel and above. Our hedge portfolio for 2018 and beyond provides us protection against catastrophic rises in energy prices without floor risk exposure, and it enables us to make prudent adjustments to our business in a rising fuel price environment in order to maintain our financial goals and reduce volatility in our earnings. We are continuing to realize fuel efficiency benefits from our ongoing fleet modernization. Our first quarter ASMs per gallon improved by 1.3% year-over-year; for 2018, we continue to expect a 2% to 3% improvement year-over-year in ASMs per gallon.","Moving to our non-fuel cost, our first quarter non-fuel operating expenses excluding special items increased 1.4% and decreased slightly on a unit basis year-over-year. Our unit costs came in slightly better than the low end of our latest guidance, primarily due to cost shifting to future quarters, such as advertising. Year-over-year increases in salary, wages and benefits, maintenance and airport costs were offset by lower depreciation and aircraft rentals and due to Classic retirement benefits.","For the second quarter, we expect our CASM, excluding fuel and profit-sharing, to increase in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year, and the primary drivers there include labor costs, including our agreement with AMFA and higher cost related to an extended operating day driven by our Classic retirement and our current fleet deficit; and as I mentioned earlier, cost shifting from first quarter and estimated costs related \u2013 and other more minor cost.","For full year 2018, we now expect our CASM, excluding fuel and profit-sharing to be comparable year-over-year, and again this includes our agreement with AMFA. I am pleased with our first quarter cost performance, and we remain focused as always on controlling our costs and finding ways to be more productive and efficient.","And now, before I cover our financial positions, capital deployment and growth outlook, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide an update on Flight 1380.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Okay. Well, thank you, Tammy. So, here's what we know from the NTSB so far. We had a failure of the number one engine, and there's an engine fan blade partially missing and that's blade 13 of 24. There was a remnant of the blade that was still attached to the fan hub; and when it was tested, it was found to be fatigued. And the NTSB has suggested that the fatigue fracture was the initiating event that caused fan blade 13 to break. Next, we know that the engine inlet cowling suffered significant damage and loss, and pieces of that cowling may be responsible for the damage to the fuselage, the wing and the stabilizer. And the loss of a single blade inside the engine just shouldn't have caused such dramatic impact.","So as Gary mentioned, we're completely cooperating with the NTSB, and they're doing a very thorough investigation. We have been in constant contact with all the parties involved throughout the investigation. Just some color on our fan blades. We've got roughly 35,500 fan blades that support our fleet. We had inspected about 17,000 of those prior to the accident last week and we were on a path to complete the inspections of the remaining 18,500 by year-end and that would've meant the recommended service bulletin timelines. Since the accident, we accelerated those remaining inspections with a goal to have them complete in 30 days, and we completed inspections on about 8,500 of them at this point. And as Gary mentioned, we have had no findings of subsurface cracks.","So, this is really \u2013 it's an all-hands on deck activity to work through the inspections, the investigation and to do a deep dive to understand what happened and why. And we're going to do everything we can to ensure it doesn't happen again. It has truly been a 24\/7 around-the-clock effort, and I sincerely want to thank everyone involved for their thorough and their diligent and their committed work.","So with that, Tammy, I'll turn it back to you.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thanks, Mike. I'll turn now to the balance sheet and cash flow, and take you through that quickly here. Our liquidity is strong, and we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $3.2 billion. Operating cash flow was approximately $1 billion in first quarter and free cash flow was $708 million, allowing us to return $648 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our leverage is approximately 30%, in line with our leverage target, which is in the low- to mid-30% range.","Based on our tweaks to our Boeing order book that we've already taken you through, our 2018 CapEx is expected to be in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range. Included in this total, we expect 2018 aircraft CapEx of approximately $1.2 billion and non-aircraft CapEx in the $800 million to $900 million range.","We continue to effectively balance and manage our overall capital deployment, and we remain focused on preserving our strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. We currently have $850 million remaining of our $2 billion share repurchase authorization, and we will continue to evaluate our investments in our company, our people and our shareholders, including the mix of share repurchases and dividends with an overarching goal to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We are benefiting from a lower corporate tax rate, and we continue to expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be in the 23% to 23.5% range.","Moving to a quick update on fleet, we had 11 deliveries during first quarter and we ended the quarter with 717 aircraft. As we've communicated, we're in a fleet deficit compared to midyear 2017 when we had around 735 aircraft before the retirement of the bulk of our -300 Classic fleet in third quarter 2017. And our fleet deficit will recede when we get into third quarter 2018.","We will have significant 737-700 retirements over the next 10 to 15 years, and this order book refresh that we've covered with you in the earnings release, and that Gary also covered with you, along with our remaining order books and options, allows us to manage through our retirement and growth needs in a measured way.","Aircraft CapEx remains very manageable at approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion per year on average for the next five years, and we'll end this year with 752 aircraft, and our capacity outlook for the full year has not changed and we continue to expect an increase in the low 5% range year-over-year.","So in closing, our financial performance is off to a solid start for the year, and we're off to a good start to expand our net margin for 2018, excluding special items. And we are already realizing meaningful benefits of tax reform, and I am pleased that we can continue putting it to work by investing in our business, rewarding our hard working people, and giving back to our shareholders and keeping our costs and fares low for our customers.","So with that overview, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thank you, guys. I appreciate the time. Tammy, just quick point of clarification, you're talking about net margin expansion now. Last quarter we spoke, you had said EBIT margin expansion. Is there a change in the plan? Or am I just misinterpreting the comment?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Hi, Hunter. No, you did not misinterpret the comment. And as we've acknowledged here for the first half of the year, we are off plan. So, obviously, in terms of margins, it will depend on how quickly we see our revenue trends recover here. And on the cost side is we feel pretty solid about that. And if you, in terms of fuel, we've got a great hedge in place, so that should be helpful on the fuel side. Certainly, when you take into the account of tax reform benefit from the lower tax rate, we feel good about our net margin goal. But we are not \u2013 I guess, I feel good about our progress towards that goal here in the first quarter.","Our net margin, we're just off to a great start here year-over-year, and we will just have to see how it plays out on the cost of revenue side. But I feel real good about the revenue benefits that we have coming on here in the second half. I think we've covered those with you pretty extensively with respect to the reservation system. And so, really no change in our goal. We're just going to keep compounding away on the unit revenue side. So I think that's really the question mark for us here as we think about our outlook for the second quarter. But again, we feel real good about all of the help that we have coming online here over the second half.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then the incremental eight MAX 8s that are going to be coming in 2019 relative to the plan three months ago. Are those going to be offset by incremental -700 retirements?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, the order that we covered with you, yeah, those are for our fleet modernization efforts. So yes, that would be the intent.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, I would say, Hunter, that I'm just trying to recap my own little back-of-the-envelope math here, but there are some airplanes that are moving around absent this Boeing order from 2019 into 2018. So, I think we've covered that with you. And the number is ten, so there are ten additional firm deliveries in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022. And casting this as part of our fleet modernization absolutely means that we are planning an equivalent number of -700 retirements for these additional 40 firm orders. Now, we've got flexibility in the fleet. We can choose not to do that. But that is what we are sharing with you today is that we have exercised 40, and however they fall, what we are telling you today is that we would offset those with retirements.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Gary, I think it's a testament to Southwest's safety culture and your long-term track record that you haven't had to engage in book-away analysis in the past. But since this isn't the type of analysis that you had to do until this past week, would you be willing to share just some of the more specific modeling assumptions that you embraced in identifying the lingering weakness in May? Is there some industry precedent that you're following? All I'm trying to do is get at how you conducted the actual analysis since, thankfully, this is not an area of analytical familiarity for Southwest, and I mean that, obviously, as a compliment.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, hey, Jamie. This is Tom. If you don't mind, I'm going to try and take that one, and I'll do the best I can for you (31:13).","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure, thanks guys.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","At this point, based on this morning, we are probably a little closer to 1 point versus 0.5 point. So, we're staying right on top of this thing. But it's not as though we haven't had other events that would draw traffic down, whether it was the technology outage or whether it was an event we had back in 2016. So, we do have some history with when we have a public event and people are aware, we see a dip in traffic and we generally see what it takes to bring it back up. So, that's kind of the basis for how we're thinking about this.","But as I said, that's kind of the baseline. That's our analytic baseline, if you will. I think the other way we are trying to respond to this is we really do want to get our marketing back online with our paid search. And keep in mind, we are not running any TV or any social right now. The reason we're not doing that is because our TV and our social has a lot of personality, and it has a lot of fun. And we just don't think it's appropriate yet to bring that back up online.","We're working really close with Linda Rutherford and her comps team, her social team, just listening for the sentiment, when does it feel appropriate for us to go back into the market, right? But just in terms of your direct question, we are going back and referencing prior events and what we saw happen with our traffic. And that's probably the best we have to go with at this point, but I do think 1% to 2% is probably reasonable based on what we are seeing thus far.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's excellent color.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, and I'll just add a couple other thoughts, just to be clear. We are continuing to see some weakness in our bookings, as Tom said. And as you expect and as we stated, we're currently running below our pre-accident run rate. And this is certainly understandable for all the reasons Tom's taken you through with respect to our marketing. And I'd just point out that that's very meaningful to our direct distribution model. So, as we return back to our normal marketing activities, we expect our trends to rebound. But admittedly, it is difficult to estimate the impact with precision. But we know we've already lost about a 1 point, as we pointed out in year-over-year RASM for the second quarter. So, based on that lost revenue, of course, it'd be tough to recover the loss in our close-in bookings, but we are hopeful that once marketing comes back online, we'll see those trends rebound.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood, and as a quick follow up, in the press release when you discussed the slot transaction, you mentioned that \"the new slots are going to complement our network.\" And I don't want to read too much into that, but you could've said grow our network. Does complement imply that you're only going to fly to existing Southwest cities with the new slots? Or is that just too cute of an interpretation?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Oh, I think all we were basically trying to say is we have a strong network in those two cities that we're able to complement from LaGuardia and for Reagan. And that the main point was that we'll simply use our existing fleet, our existing capacity, and those new routes will be a part of the growth that you're already familiar with, so.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","But both of those are still developing markets for Southwest, and we continue to tinker with frequencies and destinations, so I think yeah, I wouldn't necessarily read anything into the word complement.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate it, Gary. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you for the time. Gary, do you still expect to be RASM positive this year? And if not, are you prepared to maybe adjust some schedules in off-peak flying in the back, call it, back third \u2013 back four months of the year in an effort to better match capacity with market demand?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well \u2013 and I know Tammy and Tom will have a view as to your question as well. I think that what is obvious is that we are off plan. Now, we've had an event, so I think in terms of my confidence level in telling you that I am X percent confident that we'll hit our goal, I think we all just have to admit that we're off our trend and we're going to have to regain our momentum here, which I'm very confident we will. I don't know exactly when, and I don't know exactly how much, and I don't know because of that what the end result will be.","Now I would say personally and again, don't read too much into this, but it's just too close to call. So said a different way, it is not obvious at all that we cannot make it. But likewise, it's not obvious that we can either. So, the goal will continue to be positive unit revenue performance, and don't count us out is all I would say. The only other thing I wanted to add onto that is the margins are important, and Hunter asked the question to Tammy earlier, and I was just going to add onto that. It's basically the same answer there that I think we're pretty confident of the goal of having net margin growth for the year, but it's just a little too close to call that for the same reasons on the RASM side. So, I think a lot will depend on what happens on that answer to fuel prices, number one, which are up since the year started. And then, secondly, obviously, what happens on revenue. Tom, so what do you...?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, Jack. This is Tom. Hey. First of all, I concur with what Gary just said. I also think, though, that we always look at how flights are performing. And we'll probably take a more stringent look at how the shoulder flying is performing in terms of profitability. And if it's not profitable, we will find a way to pull that back and redeploy the capacity elsewhere. But the flying that we are doing on our shoulder right now is in fact profitable; it's accretive. It may be RASM dilutive, but it's still very helpful to us. So, I don't think that you'd see us turning profit away just to improve a metric, right? Understanding your objective though, so that's kind of my take on it.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, I think what Tom is implying is that, clearly, we would prefer to move those shoulder flights back into the peak part of the day, and that's what we'll be able to do more and more as airplanes come online. And I agree with Tom; I think that is the best technique we've got to address your question here in the second half of the year.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. That's very helpful color. And then, for my follow-up, just a question on sort of new market development, could you remind us again sort of historically what's the timeframe to sort of get a new market once you start flying there to sort of system-level profitability or get it to where it's accretive from the time you enter it, I ask this in context to sort of kicking off the Hawaii flying, either late this year or early next year. Just how do you think that flying to Hawaii will ramp relative to sort of normal market development for you guys?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Those are two different questions. Let me take the first one. The first one is how long does it typically take us for markets to turn profitable. And when we connect markets where we serve and the customers know us, it's typically a three-month turn from initiation to profitability, or so. I'm sorry. I misspoke. Three years. I'm sorry?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Three years.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, yeah. Three years. So that's what we're seeing. In terms of Hawaii, I think that we're going to see a really nice ramp up very quickly, because the customers all know us in the West Coast. We have the largest customer base of airline on the West Coast. I think you're going to see it ramp up very, very quickly, and I think we're going to lead on pricing. I think that we're going to generate a lot of traffic very, very quickly.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, again.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Just to add onto what Tom said, agree with the three years. Normally, what we see for probably more of our international markets is three years, we'll see where Hawaii falls, but it really depends on the market. When you think about a market like Dallas Love Field, we saw that ramp up very quickly. That was probably about a year. And Hawaii, I think we're hoping that will ramp up very quickly here, given our significant presence in the West Coast.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, I agree. And then, Jack, you didn't ask this exactly, but our growth is very modest here in the first quarter year-over-year. And the percentage of markets that we call \"development\" is, I think, Tammy, 3%, or less. So, it's a very small component of the current system, number one. And so number two, that sort of sets us up well to undertake an expansion that we plan later on in the year, meaning that we don't have a lot of markets under development.","And the other little factoid I was going to offer up is that the growth in our newest segment, i.e., international, year-over-year, is very modest. I want to say that's also sort of low- to mid-single digits. So, the system is maturing. We've got some revenue-enhancing techniques that are queued up and especially for the second half, and I think we'll be in a very good position to undertake the Hawaii launch.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. Gary, Tom, Tammy, thank you very much for your answers.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Good afternoon.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Good afternoon.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Tom, a question or two for you as it relates to the benefits around the reservation system, can you just talk about the progression through the rest of the year and maybe specifically provide what those features that you're going to turn on are so that we can get some comfort there? And then as it relates to the impact around scheduling, what's the hit to 2Q RASM and apologies if you provided that already? And then where do you see the benefit in 3Q and 4Q being or any kind of color that you can provide to help us triangulate how to get there.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. Sure. Glad to do that. So the one res benefit, the primary one that we've been talking with you guys about is really this notion of O&D bid pricing capability or functionality. And I think you understand that, but what that does is it gives us the opportunity to maximize revenue by really optimizing the mix of non-stop and connecting passengers on the network. So, that's what we're trying to do there. And the old method, just by way of example, will focus more on optimizing the revenue at the flight level, so you'd optimize the flight but you're not optimizing at the itinerary level.","So, that's what we're trying to do and that's where the value comes from the primarily $200 million a year. And when we deployed this, oh, gosh, kind of late Q1 or mid Q1, and we are starting to see \u2013 so the team is kind of tuning it, they're getting it going and we're seeing really nice benefits. We feel really good about that and we have a lot of confidence in what we have already signed up for, for the first half and for the full year. So, we feel very good about that. And Rajeev, tell me again, I really couldn't hear your second question, it was where's the margin enhancement coming from in the second half? Is that what you're asking?","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, it's on the scheduling, the scheduling impact to 2Q RASM and then what will the benefits start to be in the back half of the year?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, it's \u2013 yeah, Jack, it's \u2013 Rajeev, it's 1 point of benefit that we're expecting for 2Q, in terms of our year-over-year RASM.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And in 3Q?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","I'm sorry, penalty.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And will that accelerate through the end of the year (44:36)?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","That's well...","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","There's a 1 point penalty in the second quarter.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","There's a 1 point penalty in the second quarter. I thought I'd said penalty, so apologize for that.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then what is the benefit in 3Q and 4Q or in the back half of the year versus that 1 point penalty in 2Q?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","In the second half of the year, and again, for the second half of the \u2013 for the reservation benefit, just want to make sure, on the shoulder flying part. So that's going to \u2013 yeah, we just expect that to recede. We will have overlapped our fleet by the time we get to, say, October and so we should see that continue to recede as we go through the year.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And if I can ask Mike a quick question. In terms of \u2013 associated with the accident, have all your maintenance procedures been reviewed, et cetera, and you're all in good shape there, if that's appropriate to ask?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","You're asking if are all of our maintenance procedures in line with the service bulletin?","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Exactly.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes. So we went back and we've been participating with GE and CFM since our first incident back in August of 2016. And so we have been lockstep with them on the service bulletins and the requirements through that. And at this point in time, it doesn't look like we have a compliance concern.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Sorry for the confusion, guys.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I would just add that the procedures that we're using are the same ones that were developed with CFM back in 2016, meaning that we do the ultrasonic inspection by removing the blade. And then our service provider, which is GE, when they do the overhaul, they do a more extensive eddy current inspection at that point.","So the procedures themselves are unchanged. What is different now with the most recent service bulletin and air readiness directive is the frequency of doing those inspections. And as I reported earlier and Mike confirmed with his report, with the inspections that we have stepped up since last week, we've had no findings at this point, which is obviously what we would expect and obviously a positive.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. If I might follow up on the California strategy here, it seemed to me \u2013 and correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 that part of this strategy of defending your position has been to kind of pull forward the opportunities maybe that you were kind of planning for California and kind of strengthening your offering to the passengers there.","So from an impact to unit revenue, should I think of that as more of a kind of a near-term thing? And is it fair to assume that as those markets develop that they should start to normalize? Or is this kind of a multiyear kind of fast-tracking growth?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I think it's the former. I think what you've got here is very typical. Whenever there is an expansion underway in a market, whether it's by us or by our competitors, there's going be some impact on unit revenue. And then it matures over time. And what you should expect is, all else being equal to be fair, that you would see improved unit revenue performance. And things are dynamic. So we'll tune, our competitors will tune, but absolutely this is \u2013 the way we're looking at it, these are opportunities that \u2013 there's an opportunity cost, if you will. So we know that we have opportunities to enhance our route system in the West for our customers, and at some point in time, we would attend to that.","So perhaps your interpretation that perhaps we're accelerating a bit, I don't quarrel with that. But I would also point out that while Tom was highlighting California, it's really as an example. The Southwest performance is not just California. We've got competitive situations all over the country. And considering how competitive it is, and I think Tom said this, it's performing very well. But we're not going to add this much capacity and have competitors adding this much capacity and not see some kind of a unit revenue impact. I think the only time in my memory that that has ever happened was the Love Field expansion. And I think everybody knows how unique that was. But it was almost instantly \u2013 well, it was instantly profitable and with nary an impact on unit revenues. That was remarkable. But that is clearly the exception.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. And if I may, just a clarification on the 2018 capacity growth. How much of that is \u2013 can get skewed around on the timing of kind of the launch of Hawaii? Was Hawaii always kind of expected to be at the very end of the year and therefore not a meaningful driver of the kind of 2018 capacity? Or depending on when Hawaii actually gets launched, could that capacity move around in the second half?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","No, I think that's right. I think that our best opportunity that we've been planning towards would be pretty deep into the year. So I think that you nailed it. Your thought is spot on.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So that it wouldn't have an impact.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, it's not going to be a massive impact. It just depends on when we get our \u2013 first of all, you have to understand, we're still going through our certification process with the FAA and ETOPS. We've been saying \u2013 we just announced to those cities today, but we've been saying we sure want to be able to sell this year. And now we're saying, we sure want to be able to fly this year. It just really depends upon the ETOPS certification. I think what you'll see is part of the ETOPS certification is you can't start with a full schedule. You have to kind of grow your way into it and demonstrate proficiency with the FAA and that kind of thing. So I think the back half of the year, late in the year, I would love for us to be flying Hawaii. But I don't think it's going to have a significant impact on our capacity.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So in other words, right now we've reserved airplanes for these flights. We haven't told you exactly what we're planning because we can't commit to an exact date yet. And then I think if we don't fly Hawaii later on this year, then the question becomes what do we do with those airplanes, and I think that answer will be dependent upon when we know that and what our options are at the time.","So I think Tom was trying to give you the most honest answer possible. It could have some impact on our capacity, but in theory it wouldn't. If we're not flying in Hawaii with those airplanes, we'll fly somewhere else where we have an opportunity. It just depends on when we know that and how productive we think that move off of Hawaii would be. But right now, we're obviously hoping that those airplanes are going to Hawaii.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. That's great color. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. I guess just two questions here. Gary, it looks like JetBlue is going to scale back Long Beach by about a third. And so, obviously, free up slots. I know you're now in that market. Is that a market that you feel like it's sufficiently served? Or would you be interested in growing your Long Beach presence?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure. Tom and I agree that we have been hobbled by not being able to have more access to Long Beach. We have a very modest operation there, so that's welcome news.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then just my second question, and this is Gary or Tom. Just the engines through this inspection process, as I recall, I believe and I could be wrong in this that you did have maybe power-by-the-hour agreements. And I'm just wondering does, if you do, does that cover some of the costs, mitigate some of the cost impact of these extensive blade checks?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Mike, you want to speak to that?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, sure. Yeah, we have our \u2013 engines are on two different types of agreements. We have some of them that are on this kind of power-by-the-hour, as you say, and then the others are on time and material. This particular airplane with our 700s are on time and material \u2013 excuse me, on power-by-the-hour. And so, yeah, that does help us mitigate the cost of those because the risk transfer is back to the GE, our service provider there.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Mike, do you have an early sense on what that potential cost could be in the quarter for Southwest, even the fact that you do have some protection there? I mean, are we talking, is it millions of dollars? Is it hundreds of thousands of dollars? Or is it just too early?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","It is a little early, but I would expect it to be in the millions of dollars, just to give you an idea directionally. And in terms of what would actually hit our CASM-ex line, there's some capital costs involved with that. But, again, we've given you our best guess as to what the cost implications would be within the guidance that we've provided.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","And those would be mostly outside of actually the engine repair costs. That would be over time those kinds of things. The labor costs associated with doing the inspections, some other delay remodeling (55:52) costs, those kinds of things.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Gary, on capital allocation, you've got capital to allocate in lots of different ways. I'm just wondering how you think about M&A versus other alternatives. You have some experience there. Are there cyclical considerations or other considerations? How do you think about that in the current environment?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, Duane, I think it's very fair to say that our primary focus is investing in Southwest Airlines. This year in particular we've got a lot of our major strategic initiatives behind us. There's always work to do. But, in particular, here in 2018 and my hope is 2019 and 2020, we're really focused on the quality and the cost-effectiveness of our operation, the hospitality of our customer service, those very basic things. We want to continue to grow the airline. We've got wonderful opportunities to grow. And the tax reform, obviously, is a nice little boost to our sources of financing.","So there's no imperative that we need to be hunting for an acquisition. I think that that's different than where we were in the late 2000s; 2009, 2010. And clearly this is our priority is just to grow organically. Having said that, we've always got to have our eyes open and be thinking about how we can improve shareholder value, and if there is a good opportunity in our view, it's something that we'll take a look at. We're always thinking about that, but admittedly that is not a focus and clearly not a focus right now.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. Of the $200 million from the new revenue management and reservation system that you said is going to come through this year, have you said how much of that is embedded in your second quarter guidance?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, Tom, we did. We said between $40 million and $50 million.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","$40 million and $50 million.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","...was attributed to the second quarter.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","And our target is to get to $200 million for the run rate in the year.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. And then if I could just follow up on Rajeev's question. If I think about your fleet this year on a seat basis, it looks like you're going to average about 115,000 seats in the fleet, which is 2.5% to 3% higher than last year. If I consider that within the context of your low 5% ASM growth guidance, it implies something like 200 basis points of incremental utilization this year versus last. And that number looks to me to be pretty steady in quarters one through three and then stepping up in the fourth quarter based on the acceleration of your capacity growth that's implied by your guidance in the fourth quarter.","And I guess when I try to think about the RASM headwind that you've called out from suboptimal time of day flying, I guess I think that that's something that should be more or less correlated with the year-over-year increase in your utilization rate. So can you just sort of reconcile the dynamic with the utilization versus what you're saying on the RASM hit from off-peak flying sort of fading as we make our way through the year?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I'll go first here. The answer is no. I'm not necessarily following all the puts and takes that you're describing. And my recollection, without having studied that this morning is that our utilization for this year is \"very normal.\" And we pushed the fleet pretty hard in the fourth quarter last year. So my recollection is that the absolute utilization of block hours and all those kind of basic things that we used to look at is very normal in the second half of the year and especially the fourth quarter. So why don't you let our IR folks take that one offline and we can be sure that we're following your question. The gauge is increasing because of the classic \u2013 all these things I know you know, but that's increasing. The stage length right now as I recall is down a bit.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","It's down.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So the trips are doing what the trips are doing. And so anyway, I just don't have of all that in front of me, and I think it would be easiest to take that offline if that is okay.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, sir.","Operator","We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Gary, it feels like the last couple of quarters have been pretty un-Southwest-like. The revenue side hasn't met expectations that there's a little bit of CASM creep this year. Can you just talk about \u2013 obviously, some of this is outside of your control, but a lot of it is in your control, I think. Can you just talk about why you think this has happened and what gives you confidence that you can get back on track in the near future?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Oh, I think it's a fair question. I don't know that I would agree that it is so un-Southwest-like. I think sometimes we do get spoiled by how good our performance is. It's just been \u2013 I think in retrospect, it's been a challenge to go through this fleet transition. And it's also been a challenge in the same year to roll out a brand new reservation system. So I think it's more timing than it is absolute execution.","I think the third thing that I would put in there, and these are things again that we're focused on. So the third thing that I would say that we're focused on is just the competitive fair environment. And we've already made some enhancements to our revenue management techniques in the first quarter I think to better manage in that kind of environment. So those are the three.","I think the route system itself is very strong. We're continuing to optimize it as time goes by, understanding that right now the length of the airplane day is too long. I just mean which cities are we in, flying to, which other destinations. That process has been really sound and especially over the last several years. So all of that looks really good to me. The international expansion looks really solid, and those markets are showing very dramatic improvement as they are \"developing and reaching maturity.\" So I think we just have some fairly significant things that we're managing through. It's not an apology. I'd kind of go back to my opening comments. When we know that it wasn't our best revenue performance, we still had a really good quarter and are very well positioned to finish this year very strong.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","But I understand your point. We get it here, and any time we have a plan and we miss it, we aren't happy with ourselves. So I can assure you that we're not saying that this is satisfactory. In that sense, we're never satisfied. But on the whole, I think it's still a very solid performance.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And some of my other questions got asked, so I'll go with this one. The disclosures that you guys provide around the Chase agreement continue to be kind of the worst in the industry. So I'm just wondering if you could address that. And then, secondly, can you appreciate that the market and the investment community may like to know more about a business where you essentially take a cut of every dollar spent on the Southwest Chase credit card?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure. I'll be happy to provide a little more information for you since you asked today. So just to kind of help you understand economics a little bit better, if you look at our passenger revenues and other revenues related to Rapid Rewards, approximately $490 million of our passenger revenues were attributable to Rapid Rewards redemptions. And most of our revenue, other revenue, which I believe we've pointed out before, relates to our partner revenue associated with Rapid Rewards. So overall, we're continuing to see a nice growth in our Rapid Rewards program, and for the first quarter that grew in excess of our capacity growth.","So that should give you little more insight on the revenues, and we'll be providing more robust disclosures for you once we get our 10-Q filed. And then just to help you on the balance sheet a little bit. $1.8 billion of our roughly $4 billion \u2013 I think it's $4.4 billion air-traffic liability, the current portion of that on the balance sheet relates to Rapid Rewards. So when you add that amount to the $1 billion of noncurrent ATL related to Rapid Rewards that you see on the balance sheet, you'll get a total air traffic liability balance related to Rapid Rewards of $2.8 billion. So roughly half of our total ATL when you add \u2013 when you look at both the current and noncurrent portions relates to Rapid Rewards. So I hope that helps you in your analysis.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Gary, can you understand why the market would maybe want to know more about that business? I'm just interested in your perspective on it. Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I'd be happy to share my perspective. And again, I'm certainly deferring to Tammy to guide us as to what our requirements are, and we'll meet whatever requirements we have for disclosure. And I don't mean this in a harsh way at all, but you ranking us last doesn't move me at all. I think what we have to balance is, first of all, our function here is called investor relations. And I'll bet, you give them high marks. I think they bend over backwards to meet our investors' needs. And that's kind of very much the spirit of Southwest Airlines.","At the same time, we're slugging it out with competitors every single day, and there are things I do not want them to know. I don't want them to know how we manage our revenues and that would include the Chase component, consider all of these things \u2013 well, many of these things to be proprietary. So that's the only reason. We're not trying to hide anything from our investors, per se. But I think you understand that investors also aren't loyal to Southwest. They own our competitors. So we have the duty of protecting Southwest, and we guard that very jealously. But that is the only reason that we wouldn't provide more information because we don't want our competitors to know, and so we'll continue to make judgments about what will meet your needs and also meet the companies' needs.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you, Gary. And I wasn't trying to insult Investor Relations by any means. I just think more color on that side of the business could help sentiment and the multiple on the stock. I think that's pretty clear. Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Oh, no, I don't think anybody feels insulted. You ask a fair question and I hopefully at least gave you a reason why we just don't open up the whole general ledger.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our final question today from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for getting me in at the end. So, Gary, I'll just ask one, and I think you even alluded to it. If you can't get the Hawaii flying off the ground, you'll find somewhere else to put the aircraft in the back half of the year. But the reality is fuel prices have come up quite a bit since we've had that plus 7% capacity growth outlook out there. And this is an issue for your competitors as well, but costs go up and revenue is not tracking, so everyone's being asked as an investor do believe it's different this time. We're going to offset fuel. But no one's taking that proactive step yet to really reflect that reality. So are we just looking at fuel prices that are too volatile and not thinking long term? Or how should investors expect fuel volatility to maybe come out of this? Or is that just something we have to live with?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, let me give it a try and you redirect if I'm not hitting your point. But first of all, these are phenomenal financial results. After being in the business for four decades, I'll take this year over the vast majority of the years that I've been working in the industry. So these are really, really good results. We are very well positioned from a couple of perspectives with our fuel hedging as well as the really prosperous margins that we have, the cost outlook we have in other areas and the revenue outlook that we have. I think we're very well positioned to manage our way through a real fuel price shock. What we have now is not an issue. If we get to $100-plus a barrel, then I think we have something else to talk about.","But I'll just repeat, which I hope will sum it up, what our goals are. Our goals are to have every year positive unit revenue performance. And in addition to that, perhaps more importantly, we want margin expansion. So when fuel prices go down, the industry doesn't seem to get much credit for margin expanding. And likewise, I think we all need to recognize that margins will be impacted somewhat when fuel prices go up. So if fuel escalates more rapidly, clearly that would put more pressure on us to also have our revenues cover that. That won't happen in a quarter.","And one of the tools that we would have to look to would be the schedule. But I think Tom made the point on an \u2013 I would just say as an analogy, we're still better off flying these shoulder flights because they are profitable and at the margin, they add profits as compared to simply not flying it. So fuel prices would have to be looked at in the same way. If we were not able to raise fares, would that immediately lead to a decision to stop flying some of our airplanes? Well, not if they're still profitable.","So I think a lot of this just depends. But again, the bottom line is we're very motivated. We're very motivated to generate shareholder returns, which means we'll need to continue to drive unit revenue growth, but the prize is to continue to generate very, very strong margins and aspire to margin growth. We've got net income margins, which we have a shot at this year to grow significantly. I'm happy. I think it's a very good environment, and at least we're well-positioned to have to manage our way through a somewhat higher fuel cost environment.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Appreciate it, Gary.","Operator","And that concludes the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call.","I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications Officer.","Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.","Tom, thank you very much. We can go ahead and get started with the media portion of our call today, if you'll give them some instructions to queue up for questions.","Operator","Yes, ma'am. . And, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our first question, our question comes from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. So my question is just regarding \u2013 and I understand this NTSB is still involved in looking at the accident from 2016 with the engine failure. I'm wondering if there's any color or comment you guys can provide about what the conversations were like with CFM International in the months following that, and what level of risk was expressed around those fan blades.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, Mike, maybe I can start and you can correct it. But, well, I think that there was, first of all, surprise that a fan blade would fail, and then also surprised that the inlet cowl would \u2013 it would fail in such a way that it would destroy the inlet cowl. So that immediately led to the realization that we needed to increase the inspections. So GE actually does the engine maintenance, not CFM, Mike, I believe. So GE increased their \u2013 they changed their inspection technique. They do our overhaul work, Conor, which has to happen before 20,000 cycles.","And they changed their inspection technique to the eddy current. And then, Southwest, working with CFM, also implemented the ultrasonic examination. And we were doing that initially on the \u2013 just in layperson's terms, we were identifying the older blades in our fleet and examining those first, and then, ultimately, by the end of 2017 decided that we would inspect every single blade in our fleet every time that we touched it for our maintenance step in between the overhaul, and that is every 3,000 cycles.","And by the way, that is what you now see the service bulletin by CFM and then the Airworthiness Directive by the FAA has evolved essentially to that. So, well, I beg your pardon. I think it's just the service bulletin by CFM. So I think the short answer is I thought their response was appropriate. It was aggressive and we'll continue to work with the manufacturer to improve the blades so that, in essence, the inspections aren't necessary. But again, you look at what Mike reported earlier and what I did, with all the blades that we've examined, you just don't find any cracks in these blades. I think we found one previous to 2017, and that blade, of course, was discarded. But just very, very few failures, but we'll continue to work with both Boeing and GE to improve those engines. In the meantime, we'll make sure there are no blades on engines that have fatigue in them.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, Conor, you also, just in that first event back in 2016, the engine, the worldwide fleet of those engines probably had north of 300 million flight hours on it, and that is the first time in the history of that engine that they had that kind of an event. And so I thought that GE and CFM, I thought they were very aggressive on trying to understand what happened there and whether or not it was just an anomaly or that it was some type of age or other type of issue. And so I agree with what Gary said. So they focused on inspection techniques, they were needing improvements to inspection techniques, there was an introduction of the ultrasonic inspection, there was a drive to look at older engines, then into certain part numbers, and then into this most recent service bulletin that I think is very comprehensive.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And we'd be happy to take you through that in more detail because there have been \u2013 there is confusion, there have been now three service bulletins by CFM and, Mike, I think that they probably supersede the previous one, in effect, but that's confusing. The FAA was working on a proposed rulemaking asking for comment during 2017 while we were already doing these inspections. So that has never been issued in that form. Instead, the FAA came out with an Emergency Airworthiness Directive last Friday, which we will do all the incremental inspections required by that very easily before their deadline. I think we'll want to work with them to agree that we are in compliance with all the other engines that we have inspected, things like that. But the stepped-up inspections are necessary. I think we're doing them at a very quick interval, and it's just to make darn sure that we don't have any blades on engines that have a crack in them.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alana Wise with Reuters.","Alana Wise - Reuters","Hi. Thanks so much, everyone, for taking my question. So this is something that I think has been a little bit unclear throughout the course of this whole thing, but prior to the blowout on Tuesday, had the engine involved been inspected as part of the 2016 look into this class of engines?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","No, that was made clear. That engine was not inspected. And the reason is because it did not meet the criteria that the manufacturer had established for inspection. It was due for the inspection this year. So it was on, again, it was on the schedule to be inspected, but just had not been inspected by April. So what, of course we have done since last Tuesday is we said we are going to inspect every engine in the fleet, meaning every blade in the fleet, either since 2016 or over the next month. And then we will have a baseline, and we will be inspecting those every 3,000 cycles from that point forward. So hopefully all those moving parts made sense to you.","Alana Wise - Reuters","Fantastic. Thanks so much.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Except for your question, the engine had been through all of its required inspections and overhauls, et cetera, so it was fully up to date in terms of its maintenance. It just had not been inspected for this current matter yet. So again, it would've been later this year.","Alana Wise - Reuters","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Hi. Thanks. Gary, I wanted to ask, because you said there'd been one previous cracked blade found before 2017. Can you say when that was? And then my second question is maybe for Mike. You said you haven't found any fatigue or cracks, but have you found anything else in the blade inspections that you guys thought was unusual or noteworthy or anything at all?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, Mary, I'll start, so yeah, we all do the blade inspections, and I wouldn't say we found anything noteworthy. You see normal coating, maybe the normal mix you would find on fan blades with foreign object debris, things like that. So as we found those in these inspections, we have replaced those blades.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","And then back on your question on \u2013 the comment that Gary had, it had a crack in it, that was part of some work that we were doing with GE, and it was back in May of 2017.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay. So it was after the 26th incident?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Right, it was part of the inspection processes that we were going through and found that blade.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And I think we have about 36,500 blades. And so out of all those blades, we found one. And so obviously, now we know that there will be blades with cracks in them. So there's nothing so extraordinary about that, but it is at least hopefully comforting to know that there was only one that was found with the inspections that were done. So now the point being, we'll just have to keep up with all the blades in the fleet with very frequent inspections with an abundance of caution to make sure that that doesn't slip through.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay. And if I can double check on the number, you said 36,500. I thought Mike earlier said 35,500. But maybe I just misheard. The total number of ...","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","It's 35,500.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","35,000. Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","As usual, Mike is right.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Thank you very much.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Leslie Josephs with CNBC.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You, Mike, had said earlier that a fan blade itself isn't capable of causing so much damage. Are there any tests you're doing, or CFM is recommending to test the cowling or how stable it is or something like that? And my second question, are you speaking or working on any training with the flight attendants? I know there was a lot of commentary about people using oxygen masks wrong, just about how to ensure the passengers are following along with the safety briefings? Thanks.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Just a couple of things. First of all, in terms of engines and engine design, the engines are frequently tested with respect to a fan blade failure and having those contained inside the engine and in the engine cowling. The cowling that we're talking about now is an inlet cowl, so it's a before \u2013 it conducts airflow into the engine, and so it's before the containment part of that. And that's what we're talking about is whether or not there are opportunities in the inlet cowl to improve its durability so that it can minimize the kind of energy that comes out with this fan blade release.","In terms of the flight attendants, actually one of the great things about social media is that you do get a good view of what is going on inside the cabin. And we absolutely will look and try to learn from things that we can do better, make our customers more safe, make sure that the training and the communication out into the cabin is adequate. And as a matter of fact, the NTSB has set up a group to kind of study the in-cabin services, so I know that they'll do a thorough investigation of that and may come out with some good recommendations.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Since that incident, since the 1380, they've done that?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Who's that? The NTSB?","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Yeah.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, that's part of the 1380, that's part of the investigation, they're looking at the onboard in-cabin activities.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Okay. But you're not working on anything specifically just yet?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","We're supporting them in that effort.","Leslie Josephs - CNBC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Good morning. I have two questions. One, can you give us, either Tammy or Gary or somebody, a dollar figure associated with the bookings hit from flight 1350?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I think what Tammy and Tom were talking about earlier was 1 to 2 points or percent of second quarter revenues, so do you have that off the top of your head?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","An absolute number? It's in the $35 million to $40 million range.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, (1:27:43).","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Perfect, thank you.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","It's just a rough ballpark. It's $50 million to \u2013 if you just do the math, and it's a wide range, so we were kind of going in the middle, it's going to be at least a $50 million impact and, if you just do the math, it's $50 million to $100 million.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Okay. And one more question unrelated to that, for Tom on the ETOPS certification in Hawaii. I'm no ETOPS expert, but when you were just mentioning, you were talking about, through this process you might be able to start small with Hawaii as you're going through the process. Can you give us any more color on that? I just wasn't aware that was an option as you go through. I thought that you had to get your certification and then the service began.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Oh no, once we get the certification, we will begin service. So I think the question is when will we get the certification. We're hoping to get it sometime later this year. But in terms of our scheduling, Gary announced the four cities via the four airports we intend to serve. Our network planning team certainly has laid out, here's what we would see the schedule being. It's not time for us to announce that, but when we do start service, it will be smaller, and it will begin to ramp up over time, I would think.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Okay. I must've misunderstood what you said then.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, but in other words, Dawn, it's always been our intention to start modestly, like with probably one city pair and focus that way, and then we would like ultimately to those four airports that we announced today. Obviously, that's our committed plan to serve all four. What we've not announced is what routes and when we'll start, and which one we'll start with. But we've always intended and the FAA has always understood that we'll start modestly.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","And when you say modestly, with that one city pair. Is that your goal for this year, if you are able to pull it off this year?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","I mean, on the first day, I think it would be probably one city pair. And part of that, I think in fairness to us, is to be determined in working with the FAA. But that's kind of the idea that you ought to be thinking about. Now I don't see us serving just one city pair for very long, and I'd rather not say how short just yet. But yeah, I think we're definitely planning to start very modestly.","Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to David Koenig with The Associated Press.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Hi. Thanks. I know it's getting late. I have two questions, but the first is kind of to clarify what Mike said earlier and then Gary followed up on. So if I heard Mike correctly, you've inspected, it sounds like, 25,500 or so of your 35,500 blades. So that would mean you've got, what about 10,000 left to inspect and you're going to do those in the 30-day window. Are those all newer second-generation blades?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, we've been focused mostly on our 700 fleet, David. So yeah, so the lion's share of what's remaining really is the 800 fleet, and those should be \u2013 we just started taking the 800s five or six years ago, so generally speaking, yeah, those would be the newer-generation blades.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","But I think, David, we started with going back to 2016, the oldest blades, then we worked out within Southwest and with CFM, the oldest engines. And so the focus has been on engines since then, knowing that blades move around between engines. So by accelerating all the inspections to within the next 30 days from last week, we will have covered every single engine regardless of the age of the blade.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Right. Okay. Great. Well, that leads into the other question I had, which was whether you ever considered grounding any planes, like maybe those with engine cycles, with the most engine cycles either new or since their last shop visit? Was that ever under thought?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Based on all the...","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","After, yeah.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","...evidence that we have, based on discussions with CFM, Boeing, the FAA, the NTSB, that wasn't a consideration because of the accelerated inspection cycle and just the history and the data that we have on these fan blades.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, at this time I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.","Linda B.

My name is Chad and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Martinez","Thanks, Chad. Thank you all for joining us today. Joining me on the call we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Van de Ven, our Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO.","A few quick notes. We will be making forward-looking statements based on our current expectations of future performance, which could differ from actual results and we will make reference to 2019 results to compare to prior year non-GAAP results, which exclude special items. We have more information regarding forward-looking statements and a reconciliation of non-GAAP results in our earnings release from this morning.","Also, given the ongoing MAX groundings, just a reminder, that the timelines and current estimations we are sharing today regarding the MAX are based on Boeing's targeted regulatory approval of MAX return to service in fourth quarter 2019. Any changes to current estimations could result in additional adjustments to our flight schedule beyond February 8th, as well as further aircraft delivery delays and additional financial damages.","With that, Gary, Mike, Tom and Tammy will provide updates before we open it up for Q&A. So I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Kelly","Thanks Ryan. And thank you all for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. All around, it was an outstanding performance and I am prouder than ever of our people. We told you last quarter, we were going to adjust to the MAX and operate a great airline and our people did just that. Our customer feedback reflects that. It was just a great performance in terms of reliability and hospitality. So I'm very, very proud and very thankful for our people.","We also told you, we would adjust for the MAX and produced satisfactory financial results and I think we under promised. These results are stellar, strong revenues, better cost performance, record earnings, EPS was up 13.9% and even without the $31 million tax benefit EPS would have been up over 9%. And of course, our EPS would have been up over 43% were it not for the MAX grounding.","Our operations frontline employees have delivered exceptionally well. I'm going to also give another special shout out to our planners or, as I've termed them last time, our replanners who continue to toil through ever changing scenarios and that is network planning, operations planning, financial planning, just to name a few. They continue to work very long hours and produce amazing results that's just truly heroic.","I talk a lot about the importance of being prepared for the unexpected as Herb taught me and really all of us to do. And we talk about the importance of low cost, ample cash, low debt levels, sensible growth, sensible capital commitments, but we can never talk too much about the importance of having great and talented employees and a very strong culture. And of course, an element of that culture, we call the warrior spirit and their resilience. So we are truly blessed to have such great people.","I want to talk about what's next. In addition to continuing to run a superb airline operation and deliver solid financial results, we want to do a couple of things. We want to conclude our discussions with the Boeing Company regarding compensation for the MAX related damages.","And secondly, we want to safely and methodically return the MAX to service. And regarding the timeline of that, the FAA has revealed this week that they received the final software and related system documentation for the MAX from Boeing and they are in the process of certifying the changes with the certification flight weeks away.","While the FAA has been very clear and very careful not to commit to a date, working with Boeing we've assumed an ungrounding date of around mid-December and that translates to a MAX in-service date for us of February the 8th in terms of our flight schedule.","So, along the way, between now and mid-December if we judge that that date won't be met, we'll roll our schedule yet again. So recall that our second quarter assumption was that Boeing delivered by the end of September, so we're about three to four weeks behind that, which is why we've moved from what was the January 6th date to February the 8th.","So the closer we get the more confident I am. However, I'm still not highly confident about mid-December. I think Ryan's already made that clear. But what's important of course is that we give the FAA the time that they need to do their job, which I know they will. And, of course, we're here to support them every way that we can.","Our plans and our outlook for the fourth quarter are very solid. We've got a schedule that's stable, if not optimal. Travel demand continues to be strong. Fuel prices are remarkably stable and moderate and our cost outlook for everything else is below our original plan.","So we've given you the guidepost for fourth quarter in the press release and the key to understand here is that, we had to redo what turns out to be nine complex schedules that make up the fourth quarter and they're complex because of the way variability caused by the holidays.","And we simply didn't have time to redo nine schedules. So we did one, or in essence one, and that results and less peak flying than we would otherwise like, because we didn't have enough airplanes and it translates into more non-peak flying than we would like.","So time has gone by since we've done that. Bookings look pretty darn good for the fourth quarter and we're more bullish that RASM will be up during the quarter and we've provided that guidance and maybe as much as 2%. And that's on capacity that is down just slightly versus a year ago.","Regarding next year, we are redoing our plan yet again, as we speak. I don't have a capacity forecast for you for the obvious reason, other than to say I can't imagine that it will be double-digit growth compared to 2019. And I would also say that more than likely whatever you guessed it would be based on our July discussions. It's going to be less than that, because the return to service schedule has pushed out.","So our 2020 market priorities will continue to be Hawaii, which is going extremely well and based on what we published so far, we'll have an emphasis on Denver, Baltimore and Houston. And obviously, looking forward to having the MAX back so we can restore a lot of depth that is currently missing in a lot of our markets. So Mike, Tom and Tammy as always are going to elaborate further those are the highlights.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Mike Van de Ven to kick this off. Mike?","Mike Van de Ven","Well, thanks Gary, and good morning, everyone. I spend a lot of time talking about the importance of teamwork and especially in our industry where our customers are completely dependent on our people to take good care of them and our people do take a lot of pride in that. They jump through all kinds of routes taking care of our customers in light of the MAX groundings throughout the second quarter.","And it wasn't until June which finally had the MAX out of the schedule and a sufficient number of spare aircraft incorporated into the network. So the third quarter was really the first clean quarter without having to scramble operationally due to the MAX impacts.","As I mentioned in our second quarter call, it was important for us going into the third quarter to deliver the operational reliability, hospitality and efficiency that our customers have come to expect from Southwest. And you know our people were just magnificent. They delivered the best overall operation that Southwest has produced in at least a decade.","Our on-time performance for the quarter was 83.4% that's the best since 2011. We carried 30.5 million bags in the quarter and 99.6% of those were handled just as they were checked and that's the best performance in our history. Our customers certainly noticed all of that.","Two out of three of them were net promoters of Southwest based on our survey results. That's the highest it's been in five years. And again, we believe the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio as measured by complaints of the BOT and we're also leading year-to-date in that measure.","So overall an exceptional operational performance and we accomplish those results with the lowest amount of aircraft time invested in blocks and turns in the industry.","With respect to our turns, we had a heavy focus in the third quarter on rolling out bag scanning technology. We introduced the scanners and we trained 10,000 plus ramp agents in all of our domestic locations over a five-month period and that effort ended September 30th. So that's a foundational investment that's going to help us track our bags with more accuracy provide more customer service, automated aspects of the weight balance process and move toward a paperless turn.","So we expect this kind of operation reliability to continue. And at this point in October our on-time performance and a bag handling is shaping up again to be the best in years. The operation is solid and our biggest unknown at this point is the MAX return to service timing.","As Gary mentioned as you all know we've pulled MAX related flying from our schedules through February 8th. We had previously planned for an early November return to fly and our expectation to split at least a month. And as Gary mentioned Boeing did confirmed -- reaffirmed yesterday that their target was to return the MAX to service in the fourth quarter. And we are in continued conversations with Boeing and the FAA as they complete their various milestones in the process and we'll get a clear picture of when the aircraft may be cleared to fly.","If we don't have certainty of the mid December return to service, we will likely need to push our cancellations out further. So once the aircraft are cleared to fly our process to get them back in the service the same as I reported last quarter. It will take 30 to 40 days from the issuance of the airworthiness directive to get our manuals updated, FAA approval and our pilots trained. ","Our assumptions at this point is that the pilot training will be computer-based training and we will not require simulator time. We will be coordinating work necessary to bring the aircraft back into the operational fleet to correspond to the end of that pilot training period. So Boeing owes us 41 aircraft that we contracted for 2019 that have yet to be delivered. And we add that to the 34 own MAXs and that gives us 75 aircraft of backlog to ingest into the fleet when the grounding is lifted.","We believe that we can manage that at a rate of about 5 to 10 airplanes per week which if you do the math implied to two to four months before all of our 2019 and prior MAX aircraft are back into operational service.","As Gary mentioned our main objective in relaunching the MAX is to do it with a high degree of certainty and confidence. It's critical that the schedule and the aircraft availability come together so we avoid the unexpected customer disruptions that we had early in the year. ","So in closing, I am so grateful to all of our employees. They are the heartbeat of Southwest Airlines. They are the best. The operational results for the third quarter were superb our plans to return the MAX to service are well thought out. They are embedded and are coordinated across all of our operating teams. And our focus remains on running a safe, reliable, hospitable and efficient operation.","And I think we've got the best team in the industry to do it. So with that Tom, over to you.","Tom Nealon","Okay. Well thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start -- I'm going to pick up right where Mike left off. I also want to echo what Gary and Mike said we just had tremendous third quarter operationally absolutely rock solid. The service and hospitality was incredible.","We're the very top of the industry in terms of our service and we deliver great financial results. And I really do believe as Mike and Gary said this is absolutely because we have incredible people. They are just so committed toward Southwest Airlines stands for. So I want to thank each of you for the great performance. So with that let me just jump right into the third quarter.","Our RASM growth of 4.2% year-over-year was in line with the guidance we gave on our July earnings call and reaffirmed back in September. Throughout the quarter we saw continued strength in passenger demand trends both leisure and business travel were strong and we continue to see strong year-over-year passenger yields.","We are obviously significantly impacted by the removal of the MAX from our schedules and the result was our capacity declined 2.9% in the quarter. We had an awful lot of moving parts. We made a lot of schedule changes But we did have to make some choices around the timing of network investments on a market by market basis.","But even with the MAX challenge, we generated record third quarter passenger revenues and record operating revenues as well as record RASM performance. Our commercial team did an absolutely incredible job of minimizing a good portion of the MAX impact. And as expected we experienced roughly two points of temporary year-over-year RASM benefit for Q3 comparing us our original plan before the MAX grounding.","We also had a 0.5 point year-over-year RASM benefit from our new res system and revenue management tools as expected. And we also had a 0.5 point year-over-year RASM tailwind from 2018 sub-optimal schedule as well as 0.5 point tailwind from Flight 1380.","Our other revenues increased 8.6% year-over-year for the quarter. This is primarily due to the continued strong performance of our Rapid Rewards program. And on a year-to-date basis our other revenue is growing at 11.4%. So we're continuing to see strong growth in spending on our co-brand credit cards. I think this is really being driven by two things.","First our customers tend to keep our credit card top of mind and top of wallet. And I really see this as a function of the real value that our customers get from the program. So they tend to use our card as a primary credit card which is very important.","Second we're seeing new credit card acquisition growth rates in the double-digits on a year-over-year basis. And the acquisition growth rates on our business co-brand cards are even higher. So we're seeing tremendous growth in the size of our credit card portfolio.","Our Rapid Rewards program continues to perform very well and we are very pleased with the structure and the economics of our program as well as with our Chase relationship. The beauty of the program is simplicity and the value that it brings to our customers.","No seat restrictions. No blackout dates. It's easy to earn, its easy to redeem points. So there is really value to our customers and they love it which is why it\u2019s an award winning program year after year after year. So our loyalty program is kicking all cylinders and we couldn't be -- we're happy with where we are.","My last point on Q3 as I'm sure most of you have seen by now, we did announce in early August our plan to expand into the global distribution systems or GDSs with new agreements with Travelport and Amadeus. And we will have the highest level of GDS participation with industry standard capabilities which will make it easier for travel management companies and corporate travel managers to do business with Southwest.","And this opens up a whole new pool of corporate customers that we haven't had access to our current distribution platforms. And I also think it's important to note that the vast majority of domestic business travel is booked as coach travel which we happened to be pretty good at.","Our product has a lot of distinct advantages the business travelers, corporate travel managers truly value such as low fares, a strong network with high frequencies, roughly 75% of our customers fly non-stop, no fees for changes to itineraries which by the way that's a big deal for business travelers, its been a lot of money and no bank fees a great loyalty program and so on and so on.","So we have a great product for the business traveler. But the GDS channel is a channel where we've never truly competed. But as you'd expect, once we did go live in this channel we intend to compete very hard to win the business traveler.","We are targeting to have our GDS capabilities up and running by mid 2020 and we expect initial ramp-up will contribute $10 million to $20 million of EBIT contribution for the second half of 2020. The initial revenue impact is very modest. We also know there's a big opportunity to grow this piece of our business substantially over the next several years.","So we're building out our technology literally as I speak. And we're also well into the build out of our Southwest business sales team and our business to business service capabilities.","So at the end of the day, Southwest will have strength in three business to business distribution channels; first, self service through our new SWABIZ platform, which is largely targeted at small and medium companies. Second, direct connect distribution through the ATP co-exchange platform. And third, our full function GDS capabilities which go will live as I said in mid 2020. So a lot to come out on this, we will talk about this more going forward. So that's it for Q3.","Let's jump in to Q4. So for me flight schedule perspective, we've been very focused on maintaining the integrity and the strength of our network and spite of the fact that we have significantly fewer aircraft than originally planned.","And that phrase is not just a throwaway phrase. When I say we want to maintain the integrity and strength of our network what it means is, we want to maintain the depth and frequency of service in key markets. It means we want to maintain our high degree of point to point direct flying. It also means we want to maintain our high quality connecting itineraries.","And I think our network planning team as Gary alluded to has just done an incredible job of adjusting and republishing -- and republishing our schedules multiple times. And to a very large extent, they've done just that. They maintain the integrity and strength of our network throughout the process.","Same can be said for our revenue management team, they've done an equally incredible job managing the revenue environment. In the second and third quarters they were successful in offsetting the yield dilution of the MAX related rebooking of customers.","Now in terms of the removal of MAX flights in the fourth quarter we've had our work cut out for us. We'll have a 68 aircraft deficit by year-end which is double the number of MAX aircraft were grounded in mid-March. And as you know Q4 always has most complex set of schedule simply because of the seasonality and the peak versus off-peak nature of the quarter.","Our working assumption as we are building these schedules months ago was that -- the MAXs have been back in service for all the fourth quarter. So that was our base assumption and based on that we published 9 separate flight schedules covering the November and December timeframes. And these are very well optimized for the holiday and non-holiday time periods.","The reality of today versus our base schedule assumptions are quite different and the result is that our flight schedule adjustments in Q4 are very unique set of challenges in comparison to what we were solving to in Q2 and Q3. So we're now solving to a deficit of 68 aircraft in a highly seasonal period.","Most practical approach for us was to revise our public schedules in such a way as to smooth our flying during the fourth quarter versus our original plan of optimizing around quick peaks and troughs.","The net effect is, you will have less flying and what's optimal during peak and has to do lack of aircraft and more flying what's optimal during the non-peak periods, simply to ensure the connectivity between the flight schedules. This isn't ideal and it's certainly not an optimized schedule, but it does satisfy the three important criteria that we centralized a team; and those are, first we wanted to minimize any disruption to our customers during the holiday travel.","Second we can assure that we had a schedule that was operationally feasible as efficient as possible. And third we wanted to meet or to contain and minimize the impact on operating income. So again this isn't optimal. We have been able to achieve these objectives, maintain the quality of our product and our operation, while producing strong financial results.","The estimated fourth quarter revenue penalty from the MAX grounding is expected to be greater than the third quarter. That's simply because we had more MAX aircraft built in the original plan.","And unlike Q3 we had 2 point temporary RASM benefit during -- or due to the MAX we expect any fourth quarter RASM benefit to be immaterial. The 2 points or 2 points of estimated RASM benefit removal of the MAX Whites will be offset by the RASM drag from the unoptimized schedule regions in the slightly higher off peak flying.","But that being said, our fourth quarter base business trends continue to be very solid. We are continuing to see healthy leisure and business travel demand. That's across the booking curve and we're expecting a solid fourth quarter RASM performance year-over-year in the range of flat to up 2%.","All-in with our fourth quarter RASM outlook, this puts us well above our 2019 RASM growth goal in excess of 3%. And all things considered, that's a result that we are very proud of.","Just a few of the things, I'm sure that you saw we recently implemented systemwide $5 one-way fare increase. And based on where we are in the booking curve for the fourth quarter I think this likely helps 2020 more that will through the remainder of this year. But we do continue to see solid demand across the booking curve and we do believe the revenue environment continues to support yield momentum and yield strength.","And just a few quick comments on Hawaii, with the recent announcement of more Hawaii flights we will now be up to 12 daily California to Hawaii flights and we also have 34 daily inter-island flights. The demand for our service to Hawaii continues to be very very strong and our load factors continue to exceed our system average. The demand for our inter-island service is also very strong. And this also includes a very strong mix of local customers which we're thrilled about.","Our brand and customer experience scores continue to perform above our total system Net Promoter Score. And that's true for both our long-haul flights to and from Hawaii as well as for our inter-island flights.","As far as our stance on beginning service from originally announced California cities, we still have San Diego left to connect, and we'll do that in the near future. And we're planning for additional flights in 2020 to continue building off our initial success.","So looking forward to 2020, we obviously still have some uncertainty related to the MAX return to service date, and Mike and I are very close on this. And as he said, once we can return the aircraft to service, we will be focused on a measured ramp-up of the MAX aircraft. And we're anxious to get the ASMs back in the schedule in a smart way as we begin to restore and grow our network.","We will not restore every flight that we've removed due to the MAX grounding, but will certainly want to restore the vast majority of our network, which we'd expect to produce favorable results almost immediately. You can see from our flight schedules published through mid-April that we are very focused on continued investment in Baltimore, Denver, Houston, California and Hawaii.","And beyond these cities, we have a very long list of attractive growth opportunities and we will be focused on strengthening our depth and frequencies between strong non-stop city pairs. Next week, we'll be publishing our next set of schedules that take us out through June 6. So stay tuned for that.","So with that, I'm going to pass over to Tammy.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Tom, and my thanks to everyone for joining us today. We had another solid quarter of earnings and EPS growth along with margin expansion, which is notable considering the extraordinary challenges resulting from the grounding of the MAX. I'm very grateful for the incredible resiliency and hard work of our employees, and extremely proud of how our Southwest family rally together to produce strong results despite an unanticipated six point to 6.5 point reduction in our capacity this year due to the MAX.","Gary, Mike and Tom outlined most of the challenging -- the challenges we're managing through. So I will round out our remarks with commentary on our cost performance, fleet and capacity plans and balance sheet and cash flow, including the related MAX impact.","Turning first to our non-fuel cost performance. The largest driver of the 7.6% year-over-year increase and our third quarter CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing or CASM-Ex was an estimated six point to seven point impact from the MAX groundings and resulting flight cancellations.","Our third quarter year-over-year capacity growth was approximately eight points lower versus our plan, which will also be the case in fourth quarter. Excluding the MAX related unit cost pressure, the remaining modest year-over-year increase was driven largely by increases in salary wages and benefits as well as maintenance expense. While these cost pressures were anticipated, we did come in favorable to our latest guidance of 8% to 10%.","In addition to good cost control across the Board, we saw cost efficiencies and labor cost related to the strong operational and on-time performance that Mike covered earlier. We also received some favorable airport settlements during third quarter as well as lower than expected airport rate increases.","Overall, I'd like to commend our employees for executing our cost plan to keep us on target this year excluding the significant year-over-year unit cost pressure from MAX related flight cancellations.","We started the year expecting fourth quarter 2019 CASM-Ex to decrease around 2% year-over-year. We've had about one point of year-over-year CASM-Ex shifting from earlier periods into fourth quarter, and we are expecting a fourth quarter unit cost penalty from the MAX groundings to be approximately six point. Therefore, we now expect our fourth quarter 2019 CASM-Ex to increase in the 4% to 6% range year-over-year.","The key drivers year-over-year are increases in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport cost. It is worth noting that we have taken actions this year to mitigate what impact we could, including on the cost side. As I said previously, our fourth quarter capacity is about eight points lower than it would have been absent the MAX groundings.","However, we expect that we will be able to offset about two points to three points of unit cost inflation due to the benefits from higher off-peak flying in fourth quarter, which nets us to our six point penalty.","We will continue to focus on these areas to less than the unit cost penalties, but despite our best efforts, the impact to our overall unit cost inflation in fourth quarter continues to be significant.","Looking at our full-year non-fuel costs, we currently expect CASM-Ex to increase approximately 8% year-over-year. With some unit cost mitigation in fourth quarter, the MAX groundings are now expected to drive five points of year-over-year inflation to full year 2019, slightly better than we previously estimated. And again, our employees have done an incredible job executing on our plan to control cost pressures.","Excluding the impact of the MAX groundings to our 2019 costs, our core year-over-year unit cost performance is in line with our original plan to keep CASM-Ex inflation to 3% to 3.5% for 2019. And that includes factoring and the incremental $10 million of maintenance expense to keep seven of the 737-700 aircraft that we were going to retire as well as the $42 million bonus for our mechanics. Both of which occurred after our initial three point to 3.5 point unit cost guide back in January.","A quick note on first quarter 2020, we expect continued year-over-year unit cost inflation due to the level of fixed cost we carry regardless of the depressed capacity from the MAX grounding currently out to February 8, 2020. And as we gradually ramp back up in addition, we estimate incremental return to service cost in the tens of millions next year.","Moving on to fuel, our third quarter fuel price was $2.07 per gallon, near the lower end of our guidance range. Market energy prices spiked following the Saudi Arabia oil attacks around the time of our mid-September 8-K update, and then moderated in the second half of September.","The recent volatility in the energy markets served as a reminder of the importance of having meaningful insurance with our fuel hedge program. We are approximately 65% hedged for fourth quarter 2019; for 2020 we are nearly 60% hedged; for 2021 we are around 50%; and we have been adding to our 2022 hedging positions, putting us at around 25% protection.","For fourth quarter 2019, based on market prices as of October 18, we expect our fuel price to again being in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 per gallon.","The fourth quarter crude oil forward curve is slightly lower than third quarter, but fourth quarter heating oil cracks are currently estimated to increase around 20% sequentially. Our fuel efficiency continues to be significantly impacted by the MAX grounding. We came into 2019 expecting a solid year-over-year improvement and fuel efficiency, largely driven by the operating performance of the MAX aircraft, which is expected to produce 20% fuel burn improvement over our retired classic fleet and a 14% improvement over our next generation our NG fleet.","Third quarter ASMs per gallon declined 0.9% year-over-year and fourth quarter ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year-over-year in the range of down 1% to 2%. Once the MAX returns to service, we expect to reverse this trend and get back on track with our fuel efficiency improvement goal.","Wrapping up the income statement, as you read in the highlights of our press release, we did record a $31 million reduction to income tax expense late in the quarter, which related to a clarification of regulations that allowed an increase to the amount of tax bonus depreciation relating to our 27% tax return when the rate was 35%.This represented $0.05 per share that was not factored into our previous guidance. Even excluding the tax adjustment, the quarter was a solid feet to expectations.","Now turning to fleet and capacity. We have not taken delivery of any aircraft since the MAX groundings in mid-March. We retired one 737 aircraft during the third quarter to end the quarter with 752 total aircraft.","We haven't officially updated our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing at this point, which continues to have 44 total MAX deliveries this year with 41 remaining as of the mid-March grounding.","Based on Boeing, targeted regulatory approval of MAX return to service in fourth quarter 2019 Boeing has proposed to revise MAX delivery schedule that has us receiving seven MAX aircraft during fourth quarter 2019. That would result in the remaining 34 MAX deliveries shifting out of 2019 and into 2020.","We continue to expect to retire 10 more 737-700s this year for a total of 11 versus our original retirement plan of 2018. We postpone the retirement of seven of our owned -700s to help with our 2019 aircraft deficit.","Assuming seven aircraft deliveries in fourth quarter 2019 and netting out our 11 retirements this year, we expect to end 2019 with the total fleet of 749 aircraft. For 2020 based on Boeing's targeted return to service timeline, we expect to be back on our aircraft delivery schedule around mid-2020. This would result in 72 MAX deliveries in 2020 and we currently expect to retire 20 to 25 of our 737-700 aircraft next year, resulting in a total fleet of approximately 800 aircraft by year-end 2020.","Our third quarter available seat miles declined 2.9% year-over-year. For fourth quarter 2019, we expect our capacity to decline in the range of 0.5% to 1%, which would put our full year 2019 capacity down approximately 1.5% year-over-year.","With ongoing uncertainty of the MAX return to service date, we are not ready to provide annual 2020 capacity guidance at this point. We have published flight schedules through April 13th of 2020, which includes the removal of the MAX through February the 8th. And based on those published schedules, we currently expect first quarter 2020 capacity to increase in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year.","Now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with very healthy cash and short-term investments of approximately $4 billion. Our cash balance is higher than usual as we haven't been making aircraft delivery payments since a mid-March.","Due to a lower number of expected aircraft deliveries in fourth quarter 2019, we now expect our 2019 CapEx to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion with aircraft related CapEx of approximately $300 million. Our 2019 aircraft CapEx is down approximately $700 million from our original CapEx plan, which will shift to 2020 assuming our aircraft delivery delays are caught up next year.","As a result of the MAX groundings, we've incurred $435 million operating income penalty year-to-date. Still, our cash flow generation has been very strong. For the first nine months of 2019, we generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and $2.4 billion in free cash flow with $1.45 billion of share repurchases and $372 million in dividends. Our current $500 million accelerated share repurchase program wraps up next week and we have $1.9 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","In closing, I'd like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees. Despite the significant impact from the MAX groundings on our operations and financial results, we generated record operating revenues, record RASM and record net income and earnings per share in third quarter.","Our margins and returns on capital were solid considering a two, three point impact to each from the MAX groundings. Absent the impact, we would have expanded margins even further and grown returns in third quarter year-over-year. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained very strong and we continue to provide meaningful returns to shareholders.","Overall, I am pleased with our strong financial results this quarter and I am very happy with the execution this year especially considering the $435 million year-to-date operating income penalty for the MAX grounding and resulting flight cancellations.","Excluding the MAX impacts thus far on a unit basis, we remain on track to achieve our unit revenue and unit cost goal for this year. This is simply outstanding and a true testament to the unwavering fortitude and secret of our Southwest family.","All-in-all we have a lot to be proud of and we are eager to get the MAX back in service and resume our growth once the FAA deems to do so.","With that, Chad, I'll turn it back to you now to take analyst questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes today from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you. Appreciate all the uncertainty around next year. But based on what you just outlined if we assume you hit your stride by the third quarter is low-teens growth in the ballpark of what your plan would be?","Gary Kelly","Low \u2013 yeah, give me a number. You mean like 12%...","Duane Pfennigwerth","13% 14%.","Gary Kelly","No. We'd be below 10% easily. You agree Tammy.","Tammy Romo","Yeah. For the full -- yeah, for the full year.","Gary Kelly","You're talking about for the year or for the quarter, Duane?","Duane Pfennigwerth","For the third quarter, for the back half essentially. Yeah.","Gary Kelly","I don't have a number in my mind. What do you think?","Tammy Romo","And it is premature. Yeah, it is premature. And yeah, we're not prepared Duane to give you capacity guidance at this point for all the obvious reasons. I'd be happy to kind of walk you through kind of how we're thinking about the full year 2020? But\u2026","Gary Kelly","Well, I would just say, we -- I think Tammy and Mike have both said that, Mike is assuming five to 10 airplanes a week. I don't know whether we can do that or not. I mean, this has never been done before. It's just not a routine thing and we don't have -- we are in the midst of updating our plan for next year to take the MAX off of January 6 return to service. And don't have a plan yet for February 8th.","And to be honest with you, we're just going to wait a little while here and see if that's realistic before we go to yet more work to do that only to throw that away and do get another plan. So I think all I was trying to help you with earlier is to say that, we will be something less than 10% for the year, and we'll judge the rate of return based on several factors.","I don't want us to pay for airplanes and then have them sit. So some of this we'll have to just work out with Boeing. But we've said, we can restore the fleet between two and four months, but I think there is a lot of assumptions in that. And especially, if you look at the way things have gone, so we're dependent upon our people Boeing and the FAA to return each airplane to service. And there is just -- I'm just meeting to everyone that there is uncertainty with regard to exactly how that's going to get done.","Duane Pfennigwerth","All very fair. I agree with your comments and your praise for your planning and you're replanning teams. Can you talk a little bit about how the network response evolved from the initial shock to the system of the grounding and maybe here to the fourth quarter? It feels like initially you were giving up all sorts of traffic, and over time it feels like you figured out how to retain your highest quality traffic. And maybe the share that you're giving up is pretty low quality in nature would appreciate your thoughts. Thank you.","Gary Kelly","Well, Tom, do you want to -- you want to comment on that first?","Tom Nealon","Yeah. I think we've been looking for a -- I know we're actually to come from myself, but we've been pretty, pretty diligent about trying to trim out some of the longer-haul flying where we can. We've put -- we haven't taken it all out by the way, we've seen some out and what that allows us to do is connecting traffic hence we're maintaining the presence in the markets, we're trying to seasonalize a little bit. We pulled some out of the international, just as an example.","And what you're seeing us do is invest in more short and medium-haul flying, in fact, you look at what we just published you're seeing Denver and Baltimore, a little bit in Houston you're seeing more short and medium-haul flying we're getting lot of aircraft utilization. And that's pretty high quality flying and it's really being directed toward city pairs that are very strong for us.","So I think we're doing a pretty good job of optimizing the network given what we have to worked with right now.","Gary Kelly","Yeah. I think \u2013 Duane, I think your idea there is a decent one. In other words, I don't think it would be correct to assume that we have lost share on 100% of our system. I agree with your logic there.","Without studying a little bit more sort of market-by-market. I'm reluctant to just readily agree that there is a large percentage where we haven't lost, because I do have a sense that even where we've been able to sustain frequencies and markets that there may be a shift between locals and connects, and because I agree with Tom, we've taken long-haul segments out and have tried to serve those city pairs on a one-stop basis.","And so I just -- it's just more complicated than that, but we've at least been able to sustain for the most part as an entity our short-haul routes or medium-haul routes. We've shaved some long-haul in international, which Tom mentioned.","So it's not across the Board, but still we're not happy with the fact that we're eight points below where our capacity would have been. And clearly, we're temporarily losing some share, which we don't like and we've heard our competitors, which they're right to do share that they have picked up some traffic as a consequence.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks for the thoughts.","Operator","The next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hi everybody. Thanks.","Gary Kelly","Hi.","Hunter Keay","Two questions on the same topic what are the gating term -- gating items if we're getting your fares on Sabre and how much of an incremental pre-tax income should we expect if you're able to come to terms with them?","Gary Kelly","Well, the gating issues with Sabre. Well, we've worked with Sabre for a long time. We know Sabre pretty well. They know us pretty well. And obviously, they are the largest US GDS players. So their importance and we certainly you're right it would be crazy not to talk to them as we're going through this, but very simply we just weren't able to get to commercial terms of Sabre, which is unfortunate.","I'm thrilled we have two very good partners in Travelport and Amadeus. And there are lot of corporate customers out there. I guarantee who want access to Southwest's content and they will be able to get through those two. So where things go with Sabre I do not know. So we've got a good plan and good set of partners in place right now. So--","Hunter Keay","Okay. Tom and to that, you said there's a lot of corporates that want your products and TMCs that books through Sabre, but what about the TMCs themselves and how willing are you to play in the commission game if the TMCs are not going to be swayed simply by your product alone? Thanks.","Tom Nealon","Well, TMC -- thank you for the question, Hunter. I think the -- first of all, we'll be paying our segment fees as we -- as you'd expect the GDS and we're competitive they are pricing. I think it's competitive I don't think its best in industry, but I think that's what we need to do. And I think that part of the play with the TMCs is on the customer side, the customers are going to be asking for that content. So, I think the strength is not just what we think of our product, but I think the strength is what the travel managers think of our product and what the travelers think of that product. And I think that's going to be pull to get the TMCs showing the Southwest content.","And by the way to be honest with you, historically, we have not spent a lot of time with TMCs. We just haven't had to -- we didn't. So, we are out there right now with our sales team. And we just -- in fact we had a pretty big group in this past week or two weeks ago. And so we're starting to work with the TMCs and with the travel managers. And there is a real pull for the Southwest content. I guess that's what I can tell you.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you, Tom.","Tom Nealon","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Hey good afternoon everybody. So, Tammy given the current return to service assumption, the five to 10 aircraft, are we getting back to sort of hitting your fleet stride by midyear? It sounds like ex-fuel CASM challenges are going to persist fairly materially in the first half of next year. How confident should we be that those pressures don't subsequently bleed into the second half as well?","It just feels like RASM takes a hit as soon as the additional capacity picks up but cost relief is stickier and the markets assumption is that you're going to experience material ex-fuel cost release next year. But given what you've said about the first quarter, the return to service guidance, I'm not convinced that ex-fuel CASM only improves that much. Thoughts?","Tammy Romo","Yeah sure. Well, we're obviously going to work really hard to mitigate any costs as we return the MAX to service here. And we'll just have to remain nimble and adjust as we need to.","What -- as you -- as you said and what we do know at this point is that we do expect to have a ramp-up unit cost penalty in the first half of 2020. And while we do -- while we'll do what we can to mitigate the financial impact, the penalties are significant and certainly grow as the fleet deficit grows.","Of course our discussions with Boeing are ongoing in that regard. But our long-term unit cost target remains unchanged and that's to keep our annual unit cost growth excluding fuel and oil expense and profit sharing to below 2%. So, we haven't lost sight of that goal. And while they are likely to be some inefficiencies as we focus on the safe return of the MAX to service in the short-term, we'll be laser-focused on achieving our long-term cost goal.","Jamie Baker","Can you put any numbers on first half or second half ex-fuel CASM?","Tammy Romo","It is honestly -- it's just too early to do that.","Jamie Baker","Okay.","Tammy Romo","We don't even have a return to service plan. So, I just think it's just premature to do that. Obviously, once we have more certainty around return to service, we'll come back and walk you through and give you as much guidance we can. But as we've always said we want to have a measured approach to bring the MAX into service. And we've got a lot of objectives that we're balancing here and certainly hitting our financial targets is one of those objectives.","Gary Kelly","Jamie I think the issue is the timing of achieving the spirit of what you're asking. So, I think we're all reluctant to say; yeah, third quarter is going to be really clean. We just don't know. But I think once we get to the point where we are clean, yes, I think that the parameters that you're thinking about without getting specific yet. It makes sense to us. Here is what that's going to be.","Jamie Baker","Got it. And Gary for my second question. I saw the headlines -- saw you on CNBC before, the Board looking at a second fleet type. You can obviously achieve that in one of two ways; you can go get in line for deliveries and start from scratch or you can buy an existing fleet and immediately get scale with the aircraft, albeit with some other baggage that inherently company's consolidation.","So, is it safe to assume that if the Board is debating a second fleet type as you said today, it's also debating consolidation or is it somehow possible to divorce those two topics because in my mind they're highly intertwined.","Gary Kelly","Well, you are a brilliant mind. So, I do think that they are -- they are potentially intertwined, but they could also be disaggregated. I think it just depends on how one wants to think about it. But I'll just give you a straight answer. We are -- as I did say earlier we are focused on two fundamental things. We're focused on settling up with Boeing and we're focused on getting the MAX back into service.","The comment that I made about evaluating the question in a single fleet type is -- that's not new news. I've shared that before and we've done it. And they also ask me well what would Herb do and I know what Herb did do because we did this. We looked at it very carefully on several occasions.","Mike led that effort as late as 2011 when we agreed to launch the MAX. We gave a very serious look to an alternative. So, I was simply sharing that if -- and the people do. There are people do have this question. Is it time for us to look at the question. Yeah not now, but next year, maybe the following year. It is time to look at that question yet again.","I wouldn't prejudge the answer at all. We've been extremely successful for 48 years with a single fleet type. I know that our Vice President of Flight Operations would agree. It certainly makes for a more reliable and arguably safer operation when we have the expertise that we do in this year one.","So, there are plenty of good arguments for just I really feel like it's just acknowledging the obvious and I feel like we have a duty to look at the question and especially in light of what's going on right now. So, hopefully that answers part of the question.","As you know to say today understanding that we're not entertaining this question today. So to say today does that make us enthused about consolidation. For that reason absolutely not. It's irrelevant. It's because that is -- in that sense they are two different questions.","If we got to the point where we said, we want a second fleet type then I would admit you would -- you might want to think that through in terms of that as a means to get to a second fleet type, but I would quickly add. And all I'm doing is repeating our AirTran experience just because we buy another airplane doesn't mean that Southwest instantly have the capability to operate it.","So regardless of the path that we do -- that we go through with that hypothetical, we would still in Mike's shop and with technology support have to construct the capability to operate a second fleet type. And that would all have to be factored into whether we think that's the right priority. So those are all really complex questions and not anything that we are thinking about or talking about at this point in time.","Jamie Baker","Okay. That's very, very helpful. And thank you for the kind words by the way I hope that some made off the hook for having this build Southwest a couple of quarters ago. Thank you very much.","Gary Kelly","No, Herb always said here I wish all timers, which means he always carried the grudge. Thank you.","Jamie Baker","Okay.","Gary Kelly","There's lot of truth.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Yes. Hey good afternoon guys -- just guys and Tammy. Question here on I think Tom you mentioned about some of the growth you would be focused on Denver, Baltimore and Houston and it does seem like on one hand you may be targeting the markets that are particular competitor, but I suspect that those markets are focused because you can get gates there. And I'm just curious if that is what's driving that decision on one hand and then as we look out are there other airports that are key to Southwest where you do see additional gates coming on maybe over the next 12 to 18 months?","Tom Nealon","You know I think that your comment about we're going after the airports where the competition like I say, I think we're looking at this strictly from -- look at the proximity of where Denver is, where Baltimore is, where Houston is and how they fit with our networks. Our intent is to do really begin to use these as cornerstones if you will and drive more connectivity and tightened up the spider web over a point to point network. And that's what's driving it. Now there is a competitive response in all of those by the way. So that's part of it as well. But this is really primarily about strengthening the core of the network.","And I do think that there is value to us in adding in more medium and short-haul flying in conjunction with. We're not moving away from long haul at all back the MAX eight great long haul aircraft. But with more medium flying in and out of Denver, Houston, Baltimore it really does give you much greater number of itineraries, it gives you greater operational reliability and recovery. And just a really efficient network structure for us. So I think we're just building on our core point to point network is what you're seeing. Nashville is another one that you see us growing in quite a bit. So that's kind of I'm thinking about it.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. And then anything on as it relates to infrastructure, as we look out maybe over the next 12 to 18 months airports that you do -- that are key to you where you do see gates coming on where you're currently constrained?","Tom Nealon","No that seems to be where -- we see things great in many places. California we have made constraints obviously. Denver we have capacity coming on it's a ways out. Mike or Gary you guys want to step on it.","Gary Kelly","Well Mike, yeah I think you probably know what the corporates are. So I don't -- I don't know that we have anything new to share on that point today. But except to agree with you that they are constraints. Fortunately, we have a vast enough array of opportunities to grow that we can work around them and then in the cases where at least the constraint can be remediated. We're working on those, but LAX is a prime topic and we're very desirous of adding nine more gates through what is envisioned as terminal 1E and we just don't have a timeline with LAWA yet. So that's one that's well under way, but still could be out there before there is a solution. I hope not, obviously we'd love to have that capacity. But yeah I know only thing I was going to quickly just underscore with Tom's answer is we're seeing a return of demand and short haul markets which obviously we have a real strength and we have limited aircraft resources and right now we have more of a focus both in 2019 and in 2020 in addressing that.","So it's and you see -- you see evidence of that with the fact that we trimmed a lot of long-haul flights because of the MAX here. So it's not to say that we don't like long-haul flights. It's more to say that we're short of capacity and will be for quite some time and we've -- we can at least address those OND city pairs on a one-stop basis. But if we don't put the flights into the short-haul markets, it's the obvious you're not serving that market. So the good news is we got a lot of opportunities and not as good news is we don't have enough airplanes, but hope to remedy that here soon.","Michael Linenberg","Great. Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Tom.","Gary Kelly","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from with Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Savi Syth","Hey, good afternoon. And just Tammy, I was wondering if you could help us understand I can -- I appreciate just how difficult next year's planning is right now. But I was wondering if you could help us understand just some of the bigger cost items that were pressures this year ex-MAX, how does those trend into next year, should we be thinking about like the airport cost, the maintenance cost, just generally how do you think they should be trending into next year?","Tammy Romo","Yeah, sure, Savi, I'll give you a little bit of color here. Just really going into next year the biggest penalty here starting at least in January and that will continue until we get the MAX return to service is related to the grounding of the MAX. Outside of that, I feel pretty good about our cost structure. We do have ongoing maintenance cost pressures and just our normal inflationary cost pressures with salary wages and benefits. And outside of that, we are always looking to balance our technology spend and make sure that any spend or investments that we make obviously have benefits to come along with that.","So as we kind of think past the MAX, we've got a lot of initiatives under way. And I feel really good about the efforts that we have. One obviously is our fleet modernization plans and that's been halted here obviously with the MAX grounding, but certainly once we get the MAX back on track, we'll be able to see the benefits there. And certainly on the fuel efficiency side, as I noted earlier. So, just looking past the MAX I really feel good about, where we are. But as always that always takes hard work, and but our people are up to that. So I'm confident, we'll deliver there. So, and again, I'll just kind of point you back to our long-term goals is to maintain inflation CASM-Ex sub 2%.","Savi Syth","That's helpful, Tammy. Is that kind of sub 2% does that include kind of \u2013 any kind of upcoming labor deals as well where you kind of target that again excluding that?","Tammy Romo","Yes. Thanks for asking that, Savi. Yes, we incorporate labor cost into that in all of our cost pressures. And what cost pressure as it mentioned simply because we \u2013 I think we alluded to that earlier is airport cost pressures. So, that's one cost pressure that we'll continue have to work hard over the longer term to control.","Savi Syth","All right. Great. And if I might just ask is it a quick clarification question on the growth. If I think about next year is Hawaii is still kind of a large part of kind of next year's growth assuming you can grow as you want to grow or how should we think about kind of the composition, if you can do what you want to do?","Gary Kelly","You know just keep in perspective Hawaii. There's a lot of people around Hawaii. We're pretty excited about Hawaii it's a very, very modest portion of our network. It's like less \u2013 point of our network. So you got to continue invest and we're off to a great start. We want to continue to build on the momentum, but even if we were to \u2013 I'm not sure exactly given what our status of our plan for next year is, but it's not going to be a massive portion of our capacity, it's just \u2013 which is not you will see focus on California as I've said California, Denver, Baltimore, Houston. Hawaii we're going to stay committed to we're absolutely committed to Hawaii by the way, if anyone wants to know we're going to back off Hawaii absolutely not. We've opened five stations in Hawaii. That's performing really well. So, we're not backing off. It may have to pace a little bit depending upon the MAX, but Hawaii is going to be a focus \u2013 was going to be a relatively modest piece of our capacity I think.","Savi Syth","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Katie O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Katie O'Brien","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you so much for the time. So not to keep harping on the cost outlook here, but I guess just, if I think about you're 2% to 3% capacity forecast for the first quarter. And then just think about it. Can I assume that CASM growth is just linear with cost growth that would get me to based on what you're planning to do in the fourth quarter here. That would get me to a first quarter CASM-ex of around 3%. All else equal, I guess just starting there what are the puts and takes that would \u2013 that I should be thinking about to get me away from that number. Thank you.","Tammy Romo","Yes, just looking ahead to the first kind of going into the first quarter.","Katie O'Brien","That's correct.","Tammy Romo","Yeah. So just to just to make a few points in the first quarter, and I think this will help address your question. So excuse me, if I'm a little bit redundant. But keep in mind we've got the schedules out through first quarter 2020. And at this point, the MAX canceled through February 8. So, I just want to point out that we do have some conservatism built into our February schedule. We \u2013 and again all this is contingent upon the deliveries how those resume from Boeing but based on what they've indicated, they are targeting here in the fourth quarter, we would expect to have around 50 MAX aircraft in our fleet at the beginning of February. And that of course, includes the 34 MAX 8s that are currently grounded.","Yet, we'll only have 30 MAX aircraft worth the flying for sale in our February 2020 schedule and that ramps to 65 aircraft in our March schedule. And as you all know, there is strong demand, and we have pent-up demand here at Southwest. So, we'll want to ramp-up prudently but we certainly want to ramp-up as quickly as we can and to utilize our assets and to absorb some of the cost pressure that we're obviously experiencing here in the fourth quarter.","So, currently the largest step up of aircraft coming back in the service is from the seasonally off-peak February time period into March. And that's how we met to the current first quarter capacity number that you mentioned, which is up to 2% to 3% year-over-year. And but most importantly, we will want to be measured and deliberate in the way we introduce that MAX aircraft safely back into service. But all of these planning assumptions change, if we have to extend our flights cancellations further. So, hopefully you can appreciate how difficult it is to announce now down a solid plan and cost guidance for even this environment. But all that said, we're focused on delivering solid results and focused on mitigating those cost pressures as much as we can. And of course, as always our goal would be to have positive RASM in the first quarter.","So we're looking to balance all of that. So, we'll have to manage our flight cancellation impact of the schedule very carefully, as each time period has its own set of unique challenges, but again based on the current environment, I feel pretty good that we can do that. So we expect the year-over-year unit cost penalties to continue and will face those headwinds as we ramp back up, but will you know as we get past the MAX the penalties that we've shared as to you throughout the year, we would expect those to reverse and turn into tailwinds next year once we get past the return to service and we're back up to our normal capacity plans. So that was a long-winded answer, but that's just wanted to give you a little bit of color so that you can appreciate how difficult it is for us to nail down cost guidance.","Katie O'Brien","Yes. No definitely a lot of moving pieces here. It seems like an ever moving target on this return date. So, really appreciate all the work you guys and the employees that I've had to do. I guess, just maybe one quick follow-up to that question and then one more, so I guess is there. And again, I \u2013 as I just said, I really appreciate all moving pieces here, but I guess is there anything that we should think about as we go into the first quarter that would either prevent costs from improving on a linear basis or help costs improve even more than that. Just in terms of I know the return on service costs or some \u2013 or some good guides maybe we're forgetting about from earlier this year that will create a tailwind. And then just on non-aircraft CapEx, how should we think about that next year and going forward I know you got a lot of irons in the fire on the technology front. Thank you very much for the time.","Gary Kelly","Tammy, let me jump in here. I think there is way too much focus on the first quarter with your question. You know the cost performance here in the third and the fourth quarter looks really good to me. And so I feel like we'll be able to continue managing as best we can. The issue is a numerator and a denominator there is unabsorbed overhead.","And until we get the airplanes flying you're going to have that cost penalty rolling forward. And especially compared to a year ago. That's number one. Number two, as it is not linear. So what Mike has to do, if we're going to ramp up our flying he has to hire he has to hire in advance. So it is actually front loaded.","And now the question becomes a judgment on our part about how much we front-load. And to be honest with you, we don't know yet. We don't know how many people we're going to hire, at what point. In the first quarter, what Mike is trying to do is he has got two chances here, he can hit the peak for spring break or we'll miss that and then we'll try to hit the peak and I'm talking about flying.","And then we'll try to hit the peak flying for say June. And so we just don't know how it will ramp up yet. I think we will get much more visibility over the next 30 days. But we'll still have to continue to make a judgment about whether we're even going to hit this February the 8th date.","So I think, I know you want a number. I think basically what we're trying to do is make sure that we don't waste money here until we get back to something that is more manageable. But until we get there, and this is just our honest truth, it will be messy and we don't -- and we are not in total control. We're not in control of what Boeing can do. We're not in control of what the FAA can do to support our return to service. That's all assuming that we do we're on a path returning to service at that point.","Katie O'Brien","Just to apologize for the short-term nature of that question. And then just maybe Tammy on the non-aircraft CapEx, any comments there. And thank you again for all the time.","Tammy Romo","Yes, sure. And just to add one more comment on the call because I can't help myself is we are telling up all those damages and obviously have ongoing discussions with Boeing. And yes and on the -- on the non-CapEx aircraft CapEx 2019 is roughly in the $800 million range and so that not I'm expecting a significant departure from that for next year but as we've said many times we just have it wrapped up our plan for all the obvious reasons and once we do we'll come back and give you more precision around what we're doing next year.","Katie O'Brien","Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Joe Caiado","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time. Gary and Tom, you've teased us with some new revenue initiatives that you have in the pipe for 2020. It sounds like summer are getting ready for primetime like the corporate travel initiative that Tom walked through in great detail. Appreciate that. Are there any other of these revenue initiatives for 2020 that are getting ready for primetime that you might care to share with us today?","Gary Kelly","Well, no, not today. I think the GDS is the big ones in the pipe for 2020. There is lots of work going on right now for -- there is a pretty rich -- there is a pretty rich revenue initiative pipeline and we always \u2013 take you through it. So I wish I could I'm pretty excited about it but we're going to pace it out. These are all -- they are kind of sequence in such a way one builds upon the other in terms of the technology foundation.","So it's not you just throw these all there one time they are very -- it's a very adds and kind of process but GDS is a big foundational piece for us. And we're going to put that in. And then we have words that follows that subsequent to that but I think we have really great pipeline I'm just not going to talk about today.","Joe Caiado","Okay. ","Gary Kelly","The other thing is what is -- what's interesting for us next year is there is a lot of capacity that's on the sideline that's going to return at some point. And so I think we've made clear that we're not just going to put back in what we took out. So there is an opportunity there to up to optimize and Tom answer the question earlier about Hawaii.","Tom, I don't think with what we're going to add back next year there is that much development flying. I think it's and that's sort of the to reemphasize ,it sounds boring perhaps to you all but adding to Denver, adding to BWI, adding to Houston should generate strong returns quickly and that's part of our strategy for next year is a great revenue idea. It's not new but it is what it is -- what I wouldn't discount too much is the fact that we've taken the network. We've taken some capacity out. Now we're going to reoptimize that network we're forced to but we're trying to do it in a way that it produces a superior product and I'm really excited about that.","So whether we'll just have to get out and play the game and see how good that turns out but I'm -- the emphasis on the short-haul markets which are very quarter for Southwest emphasis on still retaining a presence and longer haul O&D markets and maybe on a one-stop basis. I'm pretty excited about all of that.","Joe Caiado","Okay, great thank you both. And maybe just a very quick follow-up for Tammy, clarification question really. The incremental cost sort of associated with the return to service -- explicitly associated with the return to service, are you going to include those in your 2020 CASM-Ex guidance when you do provide that or are you going to exclude them and adjust them out? ","Tammy Romo","We would include that.","Joe Caiado","Okay, got it. Thanks, everyone.","Gary Kelly","Okay great. Well that wraps up the analyst portion of our call. And as always if you have any follow-up questions feel free to give me a ring. So thank you all for joining.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.","Linda Rutherford","Thank you, Chad. I would like to welcome members of the media to our call today and we can go ahead and get started with our Q&A session. Chad if you'll just give them instructions on how to queue up.","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Thank you very much. Our first question will come from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Alison Sider","Hi. Thanks so much. Just to ask quickly about the fleet diversification review and this sounds a little bit like more of a formal process in the ongoing kind of kicking the tires that you've described in the past. Is that right and what kind of factors and metrics you will be looking at as part of this review?","Gary Kelly","Alison, I'd say yes and no. In terms of the literal looking at different airplane, it's no different than what we've ever done. The only thing that we will -- I feel we are obligated to do is, just debate the wisdom strategically of having a sole source vendor and one fleet type. That is different. I don't know that we've ever focused on it with that kind of intensity. And I don't want to prejudge the answer to that.","They are -- but they are two different questions. You can say, we'd love to have a separate fleet type, but when we look at it, it just may be economically and operationally and feasible. And vice versa, we may find that even without the strategic necessity of having two we may discover, I doubt it, but we may discover that it's better to have two airplanes economically and operationally. So all of that will need to be thought through.","But again, it just addresses a question of -- the obvious question and we posted and our Board agrees with it and we'll study it at the right time. I've said next year, and I don't feel that is a deadline by the way, but it's mainly to make clear that with the questions that we've had so far on that topic. We've made clear, we are not thinking about that right now. We're not working on it. It is not an issue.","We have two things we're focused on and that's settling up with Boeing and getting the MAX return to service. That is our focus. And as you can tell from listening, there's a tremendous amount of work involved running the airline in the meantime with the uncertainty of when it comes back.","So at the right point in time we'll take a look at that. And as I tried to make clear this morning. That's not new news. What we've said that months ago that we would maintain these things as our priority and that we would look at that question later.","Alison Sider","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And if I can ask one more, one of your employees, Mark Forkner is the focus of the DOJ and correctional investigations for his role in developing the MAX and some messages from when he was at Boeing suggesting he may have detected some issues with MCAS or unintentionally misled regulators. Do you have any concerns about those messages or concerns with him working at FAA or MAX issues now that he is at Southwest?","Gary Kelly","Well, those are clearly issues unrelated to his Southwest employment. And so, that -- all of that investigation will have to run its course. And so it has nothing to do, as far as I am aware, with his employment at Southwest. So by all accounts he is a very fine man and does a fine job for us.","Alison Sider","Okay, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Tracy Rucinski","Hi. I was wondering, what your internal research and bookings at February 8 are telling you about customers' willingness to fly the MAX. And to what extent that sentiment is playing into your planning for putting the aircraft back into your network?","Gary Kelly","Okay. This is challenge [ph], so I'll be glad to take that question. It's a good question. Obviously this is something that's getting media nearly every day, so the consumers are very, very aware obviously.","I think what it say is we do expect there to be some uneasiness, the early days in the aircraft return to service is very natural. You expect that it's natural given the nature of the situation. Just how much intention has been focused on by the media.","Having said that though we've been doing research every -- very frequently, so this thing has come -- has happened in March, rolling bands of research if you will and what we're finding is that there is very little difference originally versus what we're hearing today.","So what we are hearing is this. Southwest has a very, very strong reputation of being safe line to safer line of flight. They have confidence in Southwest and they trust us, number one.","We're also very consistent hearing that a majority of customers, not just our customers but travelers do not expect to change their flying behavior based on aircraft type. That's an interesting learning, which has also been very consistent. There are some travelers though who are saying and it is a minority, who are saying they will have -- they'll be looking for different aircraft when they fly. And they may try to avoid the MAX for a month to three months or six months but that is a minority.","But based on what we\u2019re listening to and hearing from our customers, we feel like we have a pretty good understanding, you may have to figure out how do you begin to insert that into what do you plan financially from a business standpoint in terms of book away phenomena. So we're still working through that but we are sensing as that the customers really are -- they will come back, our core customers are very confident and loyal to Southwest and we feel pretty good about that.","Tracy Rucinski","Can you give us a little sense of when you said that there isn't much difference from originally versus today? Can you -- and you talk about the minority, can you give us a little bit more color on what that looks like in percentage terms?","Gary Kelly","Well, I'm not sure I have all the specific facts in my head, but I think the majority, I think it's kind of a super majority actually. And so I'm not going to give you a precise number, but it is a super majority or saying. This is not that bigger an issue for me. I'm not going to change my flying behaviors. I think, it's in the high '60s, and '70s very significant.","So, I'm not going to do justice by trying to give you all the little fact to it's. But it is a minority. Its real minorities opposed to a -- almost 50-50. And we feel good. Our customers feel very -- they aren't easy just like everyone else.","They want to see the aircraft fly. They want to be sure to say, but they really do have confidence in the way we're going to bring this back into service. And Tom may have mentioned this but the other thing to note or maybe repeat is that, when we survey our customers' do you trust southwest?","The trust factor is extremely high and higher than our competitors, quite frankly. So, I think, that all of this they -- all the research we've done suggests that time will address this. So the airplane comes back into service. It performs well. ","And I think most people answer the questions by saying, well, I won't fly it for six months, for those who deselect flying it or I might not fly it for 12 months. And so, I think, we feel that the research supports, and our history supports, and our judgment would say that, that will be short-lived.","Tom Nealon","One just or little fact what kind of helps validate, what Gary's last comment was our customers do have the ability to see what aircraft they are flying. And you might think that given all the news in the MAX and all this stuff going on, that there will be a higher propensity to be checking those aircraft and that -- it's like less than a single-digits.","So it's actually less than 1%. So, I just don't think people are really as focused on it as we are being in the industry. I think, this is going to -- this will take care of itself I think right.","Gary Kelly","In other words we're taking bookings for the MAX now. It's in our schedule -- that's in our schedule, as of February the 8th. And there is nothing abnormal -- we're seeing no competitors, we see no book away.","Operator","At this time, we will take the last question that we have. And that is from Dawn Gilbertson with The USA Today. Please go ahead.","Dawn Gilbertson","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon. Two questions unrelated. The first on the MAX, I don't know Gary or Tammy or somebody, can you give us an update on where you are in the negotiations with Boeing, for is there any timetable there for recovering damages.","And my second question has to do with fees? I'm wondering if you can give us an update on year-to-date EarlyBird revenue and upgraded boarding, and whether you might be considering any changes there to the fees. Thank you.","Gary Kelly","Well, Tammy is leading the -- she's going to work on your second question. She is leading a couple of negotiations for us but she is working -- she and Mike are working together with Boeing. The Tammy has got to lead on it.","And yeah, I'm impatient on that, I'm anxious for that to get wrapped up. So no, I can't give you a timeline other than to say, it's a major objective of ours -- of mine. And I want that ramped up quickly.","Tammy Romo","And on EarlyBird, I have the fourth quarter, our numbers which would be helpful kind of as you think about annualizing that maybe going forward. We had very strong EarlyBird performance in the fourth quarter.","And in the fourth quarter alone that was probably $112 million $113 million. And our upgraded boarding was about $20 million, both up significantly from the prior year. And our third quarter was -- our third quarter was up about 19%.","So, we're running on well over $100 million with respect to EarlyBird. So, it's been -- it's been a tremendous success and obviously a very popular product for our customers.","Dawn Gilbertson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.","Tammy Romo","I have a year-to-date number for you, just took us a minute to pull it, It was $342 million year-to-date.","Dawn Gilbertson","For EarlyBird or both of those?","Tammy Romo","It's for EarlyBird.","Dawn Gilbertson","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","All right, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford, for any closing remarks.","Linda Rutherford","Thank you very much. If you all have any other question or inquiries, you can contact our communications group 214-792-4847 or you can send in inquires through our online newsroom at www.swamedia.com.

Tammy is going to take us through the quarter, but I want to offer up, not a comprehensive overview, but at least a few highlights.","Of course this was by far our best year of earnings in our entire history, and that includes a record return on invested capital of 32.7%. We no doubt benefited from 29% lower economic jet fuel prices. Obviously that was a major component of our earnings. But so were record load factors, and revenues were up also very solid 5.6%. It was a strategic year for us in that we had secular growth opportunities at Dallas arising from the refuel of Wright Amendment and of course that has been a phenomenal success.","We\u2019ve also had secular growth opportunities out of Washington Reagan and LaGuardia that is arising from the acquisition of slots. It was also a year that follow at the end of 2014, the completion of the AirTran, our acquisition and integration. a lot of new markets resulted from that. And then of course it was also a year where we had a unique opportunity in which to build in international terminal and launch international flights out of Houston Hobby. That was for the first time since 1969 by the way.","All of that added up to capacity growth of 7.2%, and then of course we were delighted that traffic was stronger than that. It grew 8.8%. And as a backdrop the economy for last year was solid travel demand was solid and of course energy prices moved even lower. So the convergence of all of these things made 2015 very successful year, but again one that was also very strategic for us.","And we accomplished virtually everything that we set out to do, and in some cases where we didn\u2019t, we at least laid significant progress. I'm very happy about that, but certainly that includes generating record operating cash flow, strong free cash flow, and we also returned a record $1.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. So I want to make sure that I highlight two announcements from this morning's release. First of all, we announced that we will soon launch a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. I'm sure you all saw that. And then second we recently ordered 33 new 737-800s from Boeing, and that is spread out for delivery in '16, '17 and '18; and the sole purpose for that is to accelerate further the retirement of our Classic fleet.","So mechanically we did that by exercising six options, and then on top of that we placed new orders for 27 more. So you get to 33 more new airplanes. And then in addition to that on our fleet chart, you'll also see that we have committed to two more used aircraft. But I just want to reiterate that our capacity plans for the next five years are essentially unchanged by this announcement. We're replacing the Classics with next generation airplanes. And then in particular our capacity plans for 2016 are unchanged and we still plan to grow this year between 5% and 6%.","So the financial, operations and customer service effects of these fleet announcement are all very favorable and Tammy will take us through all that. Work continues along three basic themes this year, as far as investment goes for the future. One as we have significant airport renovation and infrastructure projects underway across the country, some we're managing, some we're not. But big project at LAX, Fort Lauderdale, Chicago Midway and New Orleans. In that Fort Lauderdale in particular will bring on new capacity for us in 2017. Number two, we've got significant commercial technology program underway, and the headline on that of course is the replacement of a reservation system that's also targeted for 2017. And then finally we have a major program underway with our operations technology, and the headline on that is the new 737 MAX, along with other very significant technology improvements that [Indiscernible] has planned, and that is also a 2017 deliverable, at least with respect to the MAX.","So for this year, in addition to focus on these investment programs, we want to do a handful of things. We want to continue to manage our network growth and mature our developing markets. Number two we want to compete vigorously in an increasingly competitive environment. Number three, we want to continue to work on and improve our reliability of our operations. Next, we want to continue our focused on the hospitality of our customer service, and through all of this, we want to continue to grow our unit revenues, our margins and our earnings. So there is nothing really fancy about or 2016; pretty basic blocking and tackling things. But clearly 2017 is shaping up to be a pretty big year for Southwest Airlines.","I just want to highlight for our Southwest people finally that our profit sharing for 2015 will eclipse last year's record and increase by 74% to an all-time record of $620 million, and I am very pleased about that. I'm very proud of them and their hard work and I am very pleased that they're being justly rewarded with that.","So Tammy, with that quick overview I'd love to turn it over to you and have you take us through the quarter.","Tammy Romo","All right, thank you Gary and welcome everyone. We're very pleased to report a standard year of record performance in 2015, representing our 43 consecutive year of profit. Our annual earnings, excluding special items were a record $2.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted share, which was an increase of 75% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter performance was also record setting, and represented 11 consecutive quarter of profit. Fourth quarter net income excluding special items increased 46% year-over-year to $591 million or $0.90 per share, which was in line with consensus. ","Operating income excluding special items was a record $992 million, which produced a 5-point improvement in operating margin of 19.9%, which is the best fourth quarter margin we've seen since 1978, and it's also worth nothing like last quarter with and without the benefit substantially large rail prices, our earnings and margins improved year-over-year. And the record that really stands out is free cash return on invested capital, excluding special items of 32.7%. I would like congratulate all of our outstanding employees on these fantastically built and like Gary thrilled we can reward our employees with a record breaking profit sharing $620 million for 2015.","Our total operating revenues in the fourth quarter were a record $5 billion, up 7.5% year-over-year on a capacity increase of 8.4%. Passenger revenues were also a record $4.6 billion. Demand for our low fares remained very strong throughout the quarter, resulting in more than 11% growth in traffic, and an all-time fourth quarter record high load factor. A softer yield environment resulted in a 7% decline in passenger revenue yields and an $8 decrease in our average fares. Our fourth quarter operating revenues included a $125 million net benefit from the amended Chase contract and the required accounting treatment, and this $125 million benefit was about 2 to 3-point improvement to RASM.","For 2016, we expect to realize a year-over-year incremental benefit from the amended Chase agreement and accounting change, but once we reach third quarter, we will of course lapse the year-over-year benefit. For our first quarter 2016, our estimated incremental benefit is approximately $110 million and that is included in the RASM guidance that we provided. Our developmental markets continue to perform in line with our expectations, and Dallas continued to outperform the system on margins and return.","International is also developing as planned, including our inaugural service from Houston, which was launched during the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter RASM declined 0.7%, which was in line with our guidance. Considering a point impact from development markets and roughly 2-point impact from increased [indiscernible] in space, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter record and likely industry leading revenue performance.","Thus far in January, demand for our low fares remained strong, soft yet stable yields have continued thus far into first quarter and based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we are estimating first quarter 2016 RASM will be flat year-over-year. In light of the current yield environment, we're very pleased with our first quarter revenue outlook at this juncture.","Our freight and other revenue production was also favorable. In addition to the incremental benefit from the amended Chase card that I mentioned earlier, our ancillary revenue production was strong led by growth in EarlyBird and our upgraded boarding revenues. And we currently expect first quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to be comparable with fourth quarter 2015.","I'll turn to our cost performance now, and our fourth quarter unit cost, excluding special items decreased just under 7%, year-over-year due to substantially lower fuel prices and cost control, particularly our fleet modernization efforts. Our economic fuel cost decreased almost $200 million year-over-year and that was driven by a 23% decline in fuel prices. With the current state of the oil market and oversupply situation, we currently expect another year-over-year decline in first quarter and full year 2016 economic fuel cost.","Based on our current hedge portfolio for this year, and market prices as of last Friday, we expect our first quarter fuel price to be approximately $1.70 per gallon, and I'll also provide you our estimates by quarter here. Second quarter is expected to be approximately $1.60 per gallon, and second half we expect that to be in the $1.80 to $1.95 per gallon range, again based on last Friday.","And that brings us to a full year 2016 fuel price per gallon in the $1.70 to $1.75 range. So our market prices, we're still benefiting from lower fuel prices and currently estimate over $500 million in economic fuel savings this year. Our first quarter 2016 estimated fuel price per gallon is below last year's $2 per gallon and represents the lowest economic fuel price we've realized since third quarter of 2006.","With respect to our hedge book, our strong profit margins today call for a more conservative approach to hedging in this low fuel environment. We will continue to manage our existing portfolio to minimize cost as we burn off our 2016 and 2017 position. Prospectively, we'll focus on catastrophic protection with no downside risk, particularly in this environment for 2018. As we reported or 35% hedged, and that\u2019s with all calls and call spread. So while our hedging philosophy has not changed, our tactics have in this environment. And we will manage through our portfolio and just fourth quarter of 2015, we participated in 85% of the market decline.","So I\u2019ll take you through our non-fuel cost quickly. Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were flat, including a 30% year-over-year increase in profit sharing that our employees earned for fourth quarter 2015. Our profit showing expense accrued in the fourth quarter was $136 million and that brings again the total for the year to understanding $620 million, which again was a 75% year-over-year.","Excluding profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit costs decrease 1.1% year-over-year, which was towards the more favorable end of our cost guidance, due primarily to a reduction in advertise and lower airport costs than we had expected. Our fleet modernization produced the expected $700 million an EBIT this year and that\u2019s even with the drop in fuel prices. Based on our current cost trends we expect first quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to increase approximately 2% year-over-year. And keep in mind that roughly one point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation, which of course is a non-cash charge from our recent decision to accelerate the retirement of the Classic fleet that Gary took you through.","For our full year 2016, we are currently estimating a 1% year-over-year increase in our unit cost, excluding fuel our special items and profit sharing. And again, this modest cost inflation is almost entirely driven by the accelerated depreciation. And as a quick reminder, as we noted in our press release this morning, this cost guidance only reflects our current labor contracts. Therefore, it does not include the impact from the tentative agreement currently out for vote with our ramp operations provisioning and cargo both.","I\u2019ll move to our balance sheet and cash flows. And of course our balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and that's as opposed to being $835 million in cash collateral to third-parties. We generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow in 2015 and incurred $2 billion in capital expenditures.","For 2016, we continue to estimate CapEx of approximately $2 billion, and I\u2019ll cover our aircraft CapEx when I\u2019ll review our fleet plans so shortly. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in 2015, which exceeded our free cash flow of $1.1 billion. And we will have $200 million remaining on the $1.5 billion purchase program after we launch our 500 million accelerated share repurchase, which we will be doing soon.","We repaid $213 million in debt and capital lease obligations during 2015, and issued a $500 million senior unsecured note at an all-time low 2.65%. And this was in light of our debt maturities of approximately $600 million here in 2016. Our leverage including off balance sheet aircraft leases remains in the low to mid 30% range, and of course we are very proud of our strong balance sheet, with an aggressive investment grade rating that was further strengthened during fourth quarter with an upgrade to BBB+ and that followed an upgrade in July by Moody\u2019s to BAA1. We\u2019re focused on preserving the strength in our balance sheet and cash flows, while continuing our long standing track record of returning significant value to our shareholders.","I\u2019ll move now to our fleet and capacity plans. We ended 2015 with 704 aircraft, in our fleet as planned and outlined in this morning's release. Our press release also included our future delivery schedule that I pointed to, that we restructured at the end of December in conjunction with our decision to further accelerate the retirement of our Classic fleet. I\u2019ll quickly take you through the revisions that they included, the conversion of our remaining 25 NextGen-700 from orders to NextGen-800 from orders. And it included the addition as Gary mentioned of 33-800 firm deliveries and as he noted, some of those were options that we had exercised.","And we had two additional -700s. We now intend to retire our Classic fleet no later than mid-2018, and that's compared to our previous plan that have retirement skewing into 2021. And we had a 129 Classic aircraft in our fleet at yearend. Roughly two thirds of our Classic aircraft were impacted by our decision to further accelerate the retirement; and the incremental in seakage [ph] aircraft in our restructured order book is intended to back flow these aircrafts while maintaining our current plans to keep our year-over-year fleet growth over the next three years to no more than 2% on average.","The accelerated retirement plan is estimated to produce cumulative EBIT improvement of approximately $200 million over the acceleration period, and that's primarily through maintenance and fuel cost savings. And I'd also note that this incorporates the approximate $100 million in accelerated depreciation that I referred to earlier.","And the overall customer experience will improve as well with a fully Wi-Fi equipped more modernized fleet. Our future from capital commitments increased approximately 400 million as a result of the order book revisions and our 2015 capital expenditures increased $200 million to $300 million and that was primarily related or that was related to restructuring of our order book. ","Our aircraft CapEx for 2016 is still estimated to fall in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range, and our average aircraft CapEx for 2017 and 2018 combined is currently estimated to be in a similar range as 2016 which was very manageable. While the details of our Boeing agreement are confidential, the economics of our NZ order book are very supportive of our continued fleet modernization efforts.","Overall the internal rate of return on accelerating retirement of our Classic fleet is estimated to exceed our -- the return of investment, and this is after tax, which we reported to you in 2015 of almost 21%. So it was a very easy decision for us. We are still optimizing our retirement schedule over the next few years, but we expect in 2016 with roughly 720 aircraft. With regards to capacity, we ended 2015 as planned and we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. And as we previously noted, the majority of 2016 capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of our 2015 expansion.","So in conclusion, we ended an exceptionally strong 2015 with a record fourth quarter, and our outlook for first quarter calls for another quarter of strong operating margins approaching 20%. Despite a soft yield environment, demand held strong producing record revenues. We currently estimate our first quarter RASM will be flat year-over-year based on revenue and booking trends. That's for 2016, which suggest the continuation of the strong demand and a soft yield environment.","Substantially lower fuel prices and other cost controls contributed to our favorable cost performance in 2015, and our outlook for 2016 calls for modest cost inflation excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing. And again, that was driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of our Classic fleet, which is expected to produce a significant cost savings, and an EBIT improvement and the $200 million range. We continue to benefit from lower fuel prices and currently estimate this year's fuel cost to be more than $500 million lower year-over-year, based on Friday's prices and including our current fuel hedge.","Our balance sheet is industry leading and our cash flows remain strong, and as ever we are committed to creating value, and we are very pleased that we were able to restore over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015. And as we announced this morning, we will be launching our $500 million accelerated share repurchasing, which will leave $200 million remaining on our outstanding 1.5 billion buyback authorization. And again our pretax return on invested capital was an astounding 32.7%.","I would like to close by thanking all of our employees for their outstanding contribution to these very strong results.","So with that Tom, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And will now open our analyst portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you for waiting. We'll begin our first question from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.","Jamie Baker","I'm hoping to ask 2.5 questions here. The half-question Tammy, you noted also as a TA -- two TAs out right now, they guided this morning and the impact assuming ratification. Are you willing do the same in terms of what that would mean for the XL [ph] cabin guide you just gave?","Tammy Romo","No Jamie, just out of respect, the process of -- we'll update that as we progress here.","Jamie Baker","Sure understood. So why don't we move on to Gary here, and another question on labor. Given your history of profitability, it's no surprise that your 737 wage rates came to represent the peak for U.S. Airlines easily over the last decade. But as the competitor wage bar begin to rise above yours currently, is it inevitable the Southwest pass to establish a peak with every successful contract; or put differently, is your business model predicated on maintaining above market pay scales, or was that just a byproduct of how poorly the competition was at one point?","Gary Kelly","Well, I am going to try to give you -- I am going to try to answer your question and I want to try to be diplomatic and respectful of the negotiations process here. But I would just say our business model Jamie, is great service and low cost. And we -- every single employee at Southwest Airlines signs up for that, and of course we all need to continue to work hard every day to deliver on those two things. So that is our business model, not. There has never been a promise to be the highest paying airline in the industry. And so to the extent that we're able to do that because we produced great results, I think that is terrific. But all of that needs to obviously be negotiated with our labor groups and that's what happens, and that's the way that works. I think the overriding objective for us is to continue to have a healthy company meaning that we are safe and that we're financially strong. And in order to do that we've got continue to offer great service and our objective is to the low cost producer and live up to the low fare brand promise that we have.","Jamie Baker","And as a follow up to that last point you've made and I guess this echoes the discussion that you and I had at the Wings Club. You've never faced a larger percentage of competitive capacity that have lower costs than your own than you currently do. In fact, last time you faced a formidable competitor with a superior cost structure, as near as I could tell, you brought them. So I'm wondering how growth at Spirit and Frontier, given their cost structures alters how you think about your own business going forward?","Gary Kelly","Let me just affirm virtually everything you said. The only edit I would make is that actually when we acquired Air Tran, their costs were not lower than ours interestingly enough, at least by my analysis.","Jamie Baker","Fair enough.","Gary Kelly","But clearly there are carriers today whose costs are lower. On that point you and I certainly agree. And first of all, I think that is inventible that overtime that an industry will get more competitive, especially when there is a disrupter as there has been with Southwest Airlines. So it is not shocking at all that we have more intense competition today than in any time in our history. And it is a challenge for our Company and something that I'm very confident that our people will rise up to that challenge. But indeed, it will put an obligation on us to continue to innovate and work very, very hard so that we don\u2019t lose our low fare leadership position in the country.","So absolutely, it is different and I think we recognize that the industry is more competitive today than it has been ever. I would quickly add by the way that Southwest has never been stronger. We've never had the route network. We've never had the depth and the breadth of the service that we offer. And we've never had a balance sheet this strong, we've never had earnings this strong. So it's really up to us to continue to make sure that we compete and be the best at service and price.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth","So the hedge liabilities you called out for '16 and '17, appreciate that detail. I'm just wondering, can that change or is it fully locked in at this point? In other words, if fuel goes higher, does it shrink?","Tammy Romo","It is if fuel goes higher, it certainly shrinks. I'll start there. And no, it is not entirely locked in. But I think the main takeaway there is that we -- as prices go down, so does our fuel bill as well. So yes, I gave you a pretty good amount of detail there on our hedge as I walk through our -- my comments there. So I think we're positioned very well. We know what we have to manage and I think we're positioned well, if fuel prices go up or if they go down from here.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then as we think about the capacity that you had in development last year and specifically the Redmond markets, can you help us quantify the benefit you expect, having less of that capacity in development? And if you can help us with sort of the full pie, maybe you could just talk about the markets that you launched in late 2014 that you should've had basically a year of experience with by the fourth quarter, if you saw sort of significant RASM improvement there. And thanks for taking the questions?","Gary Kelly","Duane, you were fading in and out, but I think we got the gist of your question. Yes, we have -- we can quantify at least from an internal perspective what we think the opportunity is there. I would just start out by acknowledging that that assumes all else as equal and \u2013 but, I'm sure that you and everyone else understand that.","Tammy Romo","Yes, just a couple of comments there to maybe help you out, Duane. We had, again like you said a high number -- high percentage of our markets were under development. You know what those markets are and I'll remind you that the high percentages did include the market that we were converting from AirTran over to Southwest. So the point I'm making there is not all of the markets are created equal. Obviously we reported a lot on Dallas, Love Field and are very pleased with how those markets are progressing. But we wouldn\u2019t expect our international markets as an example to mature at the rate we would say Dallas or even the AirTran markets. So they're all a little bit different, but I can at least help quantify the impact we're expecting here in the first quarter. And if you -- it's probably in terms of -- it's probably at 1 point, I call it -- maybe not even a 1-point impact from development markets. So as we move in to 2016, at least my expectation would be that we'll get some tailwinds from our development markets as those continue to mature.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Just two for you guys. The first, I guess with oil coming down so much, and obviously you're going to see that benefit from the fuel numbers you provided. How does that impact how you're thinking about the business either from a revenue or a capacity standpoint, if at all? And then second question was just, you announced the aircraft order today and the acceleration. What drove down -- what changed over the last couple of months. It seems like the opportunity has been out there for some time?","Gary Kelly","Tammy, I'll take a shot, and if you want to chime in, please do on both of those. I would admit to you all that it is -- the year is off to a very concerning start, when it comes to headlines around the world. It's almost as if we're living in a different dimension here at Southwest, and from what I've heard from some of our competitor reports too. So our business continues to be strong, but I will quickly admit that there are concerning headlines around the world. So then you translate this to oil prices and living in Texas my entire life, this is an oil and gas state, and yes, it is concerning, the impact it will have on companies and debt payments and jobs and so on.","There's no question that the United States has benefited from the oil and gas boom that was occurring over the last X number of years since the -- really since the recession. So yes, that's all a concern that no doubt you have. We share that. But at least in terms of seeing any manifestation of that in our business, we just \u2013 we don\u2019t see it. Even our oil and gas markets, if you want to call them that, produced very strong results in the fourth quarter. Several of our markets have year-over-year -- our yield pressure if you will. So that's not unique to those markets, but they still produce very, very handsome returns. But yes, it's just something we're going to have to keep our eye on. And I offer that background, just as an acknowledgment that we're just living in a world where we need to continue to be alert and be cautious.","I will then follow-on and say that we feel like our plan for 2015 was sound and it turned out to be so. We think that the follow-on plan for 2016 is also sound. It is more conservative then what we had committed ourselves for last year. And as Tammy and I have both reiterated, we\u2019ve not made any change with our capacity outlook. And especially for 2016, we\u2019re still right in the 5% to 6% range, and I think all of us would be prepared that if for whatever reason travel demand weakens, then we would want to address that, and then at least discuss what kind of options we have to react on the down side. But in terms of taking advantage, further advantage of low energy prices and boosting our capacity, we don\u2019t have any plans to do that. Tammy, before we go into the second question, anything you would like to add?","Tammy Romo","No, I think that was perfect. And in terms of your question on why did we decide to accelerate the Classics. I guess, I just point that to our fleet modernization efforts that when we set our plan, I guess, I just have to say, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the benefits from our fleet modernizations so far, and as we've continued to evaluate, just the operating cost of operating Classic as it dwindles in size. We just really took out our pencils, evaluated it and we were able to come up with a plan that actually is going to enable us to improve our EBIT at very modest capital levels.","So I think you know our Southwest well. We prefer a simplified fleet, and even though the Classic fleet is 737, we'd much prefer to operate 700s and 800s. It certainly simplifies a lot of the operations, and also just improves the reliability in terms of just less downtime from a maintenance perspective. So I think we\u2019ll get also get a boost from the productivity of our fleet, which certainly was part of the EBIT contribution that we\u2019re expecting. So all-in-all when we set down and evaluated it, it became pretty compelling to go ahead and accelerate the Classics. So hopefully that helps provide a little color as to what went into the decision making tranches. Gary, did you have anything?","Gary Kelly","Tammy, only thing I would say about -- it\u2019s always a fair question; why now? Why not earlier? Why not later? And I think it's back to that convergence or confluence of things. First of all, we\u2019re at a fleet number that is manageable to think about accelerating retirement in that way. We have more out of service time with those airplanes for maintenance reasons than we do the rest of our fleet. And Tammy made that point. I just want to reiterate. You'll get a lot more productivity out of a new airplane than what we are currently getting out of these Classics, which means you don\u2019t necessarily even have to have a tail-by-tail replacement, although that is our plan. But they'll be more efficient.","The other thing is that Boeing was available to us. Boeing had delivery positions and we were able to strike a deal with them, and in a way that worked for them and was win for them. It was win for us. So that was key. With respect to our people, think about the people who have to touch the airplane, the pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, specially. It\u2019s just far easier for our people to operate the NextGen than it is the Classic. That's just a fact. So this will simplify a lot of things for all three of those work groups and in particular, our pilots.","So it\u2019s a good deal. If it works out, it will be better for our customers and all the way around we're just delighted that we have this alternative available and we\u2019re able pull all together to end of the year. But it was an idea and a decision that was aggressively pursued in 2015, in fact in the later part of 2015 and fortunately it all team together.","Tammy Romo","And just again on the cost obviously. As always, it's just part of our DNA at Southwest. We're very focused on costs and being the low costs producer, and this is just yet another way to help us as we\u2019re managing our cost here over the next several years.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","You guys didn\u2019t buy back stock in the quarter for first time in almost five years it looks like. You'd still put money off in the repo and I understand you did the $500 million ARS. But I would have thought you guys would come in and thoughts on after cutting the revenue guide. Did that have anything to do -- not buying the stock have anything to do with posting 800 [ph] million dollars in hedge collateral, or can you give us any kind of colors, the thinking behind sort of putting it on hold for the quarter?","Tammy Romo","No. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with the fuel hedge collateral, and honestly wouldn't read anything into that at all. We are more focused. As we said this morning we are launching a 500 million accelerated share repurchase and we'll get that launched soon, and then after that we will have 200 remaining on our 1.5, which was approved at our shareholder meeting last night. So we've gone through that authorization pretty darn quick, returning more than a 100% of our free cash flow in 2014 to our shareholders. So I'm very proud of what we did there in 2014 with respect to the share repurchases. So again, actually that included our dividends. So we are -- I don\u2019t think there is anything more to it than that.","Gary Kelly","That's true. That was already a record amount, and as we've allowed here, we were also beginning to have serious thoughts and conversations with the Boeing company and what -- how that cash flow might flow from that deal. So I think what's material is that we have announced the $500 million today.","Hunter Keay","Yes. Okay that's just fair. Thank you. And looks like -- when I look at schedule data, I think you guys are trimming over the capacity at Love Field markets into LaGuardia and Regan and moving some of that out west little bit. Does that have anything to do with the operational challenges that you might be encountering at Love Field because of the ongoing legal dispute and obviously the [indiscernible] or feel it but does that have anything to do with that, or is that unrelated and there are other factors, maybe just sort of like market demand based decisions. Any color around what's flowing into that -- if the [indiscernible] is correct.","Gary Kelly","Yes. You bet, yes sir you bet. No. There is no -- I think our operations folks have done a marvelous job. They are doing what is for us ten turns a day on a gate with well -- in less than full utilization of 18 gates. So the operation actually is doing fine, which simply means that we have --- when we finally get access to all the gates, we will be able to put more flights in there. But you'll note Hunter, that we make changes all over the country, and we don\u2019t make dramatic changes in Dallas, but you've got markets like Seattle that come into mind and Fort Myers, Florida where we make very significant seasonal adjustments. The other things that I mentioned to the media on this very same question this morning is that you know that we have a lot of new flying that's transpired since October 2014. And I went through all that stuff and so has Tammy. So with all of those new way routes, I think we would readily admit to you that in some cases we may have too many flights in some places, we may not have enough flights in places, and so there is always some tuning that continues, and that is all that's going on here at Love Field. So my recollection -- we'll still at a 180 daily departures, which probably cut through everything, and answers your questions best that way. But yes we've got some pluses and minuses in routes, and there's nothing unusual about that.","Operator","And will take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth ","Just on the unit cost growth, I was just kind of curious, with the higher capacity growth in the first half, I would have thought maybe -- a little surprised by the 2% [indiscernible] growth, and then just wondering -- I know the one-point from the [indiscernible] depreciation. Just wondering the timing -- the timing issues or what was leading to that very high increase in 1Q?","Tammy Romo","Yes. You are exactly right, Savi. The guidance for the full year is more 1%. So you are exactly right. It's just the timing of when our expenses are falling.","Savi Syth ","Got it. And then just on the USCC question, they came up before; just wondering Gary, if you have any thoughts here. It seems like the industry was going through a bit of the segmentation. And I know Southwest wants to be kind of the leading low cost, low fare airline. But there is a product differential, and then your kind of performance or be at the product or the service, and merely the things that I was just kind of curious as to what your thought process is? Do you need to be the lowest fare recognizing, that there is a difference in product, and then maybe your thoughts on kind of the customer segmentation, if there is a customer segmentation or if this is truly like a commodity business and you just have to be -- have the lowest fares?","Gary Kelly","Well. I love your question. Well, everybody's question, but that -- I think that's one that's an interesting one to share. And I'm happy to have an opportunity to address it. We want to be the best service at the lowest price. Period. And describing price, I would agree that we are going to have to do some comparisons between unbundled pricing versus our more bundled approach. All-in, I want Southwest Airlines to be the lowest price. We'll win if we have the best service at the lowest price. And that's been our tradition, that's been our history, that\u2019s what the whole Company is based upon, and that's what our growth plans are fundamentally based upon.","I think it is a slippery slope to accept that our costs and our fares can be higher based on service, because as you well know, there is a long list of failures in the airline industry who pursue that exact strategic plan. And it's really a compound. It really not facing up to the challenges of finding more and better ways to compete on cost and on price. So thing I love about Southwest is it's been a Company who has been able to do both. And the other thing that you find I think, which is a slippery slope is companies can change. And while service may not be a great attribute for some of our competitors today, who will go on unnamed, who is to say as they can change that in the future. And so we need to continue to strive to be the best at both, and we need -- while we may not have all the answers at any given point in time, I think that that needs to continue to be our guiding line.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Two quick ones here. When we started the quarter, the guide was for RASM to be up about 1%, and as we moved through much of the quarter, that number was out there. And then, about a month back you took guidance down. And when I think about across the industry, we did see some, some of the carriers come in with weaker than expected at revenues. Some of it was fuel surcharges, some of it was FX, some of it was the Paris attacks. Those are to take some things that I didn\u2019t think impacted you on one hand. Then on the other, we did hear that some airlines just ran a better operation because the winter weather wasn't that bad. So I am curious with your exposure on the energy patch, was that some of it, that you saw some demand weakness in your core energy markets, or is it just a better run operation? What drove that down so much?","Gary Kelly","Mike, I don't think Tammy would either. I wouldn't blame our energy markets at all, although as I mentioned earlier, I think it is true that the energy markets are seeing some softness in RASM year-over-year, but they're still really healthy. I think the thing that\u2019s -- and Tammy will better insights no doubt, but the thing that stands out to me was Thanksgiving. And we were pretty much tracking along with our forecast for the quarter until then. And if you'll recall our discussion with our November traffic, the pricing environment was not -- I used a word and it was quoted at the time, it was unusual. So the Christmas holiday period was more normal. But regardless, you kind of fast-forward now and Tammy, maybe it might be more helpful to talk about current trends as opposed to what changed, but Mike, that was the main thing that I recall in the fourth quarter, was the yields over the week of thanksgiving holiday travel based on unusual discounting in the industry were lower than what we would have predicted. Anything you want to add there, Tammy?","Tammy Romo","Yes, Gary I agree. That really was what -- that was primarily what was different from what our forecast was going into the quarter. And by the end of year with the holiday performance in the December, that was actually within our expectations. So as we're just trying to sort through all of that I would just -- our expectation going into the first quarter based on what we've seen so far, and in January is demand seems strong. We're continuing to see strong load factors, but again we're also continuing to see those come in at weaker yields. So at least I guess the way I would characterize at least from what we're seeing so far and our bookings is stabilized.","Gary Kelly","Mike, the only other thing I would just point out is we had the same question here after -- so Thanksgiving occurred the Paris attacks. And whether there was an effect on bookings with us, with our competitor, I don't know. That's hard to tease out all of that. But the other thing that's going here is if you looking the border GDP results for the fourth quarter, and they weren\u2019t very good. So it's possible that the industry was seeing some softening in demand that led to more aggressive discounting. And it's coupled with the industry also growing faster than GDP. So it wouldn\u2019t be shocking to find that there was a little bit of a rough patch there and just trying to get supply and demand cleared at the right price.","So -- but any of that -- beyond that, we're continuing to manage our developing markets. We're continuing to manage our markets in which there are competitive changes in terms of pluses and minuses in activity and overall the demand -- that all -- as we said -- demand, it all adds up to I think a very solid outlook. And I'll just reiterate one more time, that our results are not adjusted for the difference in stage, length and gauge. If you do that, we're turning in positive unit revenue performances in the fourth quarter for the full year 2015, and that would also continue to be our outlook in the first quarter.","Michael Linenberg","It's a good point. And then just on the capacity, I apologize if you threw this out there, Tammy, but I think you gave the full year number five to six, which is obviously unchanged, but normally around this time of the year, you'd get it to us by quarter end. The way it seems, it seems like it would be front end loaded, obviously impacted by the leap day. Do you have kind of rough -- what those rates are by quarter, how we should model it for the year?","Gary Kelly","Well, she did say 8 to 9 for the first quarter.","Tammy Romo","Yeah, 8.","Michael Linenberg","It's 8.","Tammy Romo","9 for the\u2026","Gary Kelly","It is \u2013 I think it was 8.3 in the fourth quarter or so. The high watermark is going to be this quarter and then it will start trending down from there, but I will defer to you on the rest of the quarters, Ms. Romo.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Mr. Kelly. Yes, so after this quarter, second quarter is in the 4% to 5% range, yes.","Operator","And that concludes the Analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion. At this time, I'd like to introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communications and Outreach.","Linda Rutherford","Thank you and good afternoon. If you go ahead and queue up, Tom you can give them instructions and we'll get started up on the media Q&A.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you for standing by. We'll take our first question from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters.","Jeffrey Dastin","Has Southwest recently exited any pure hedge contracts early for further participation in the fuel price decline? And if so, at what cost?","Tammy Romo","Yes, I'll be happy to take that. We have reduced our hedges here in 2016. So the answer to that question would be yes. We -- we're just looking at what we had last reported to you in terms of our hedge percentages against the main difference would be in the second half of 2016. so we did reduce our hedges there substantially in light of the declining fuel market. So we went from call it 60% to 70% in the second half of 2016 to probably closer to 30% to 35%.","Jeffrey Dastin","And a brief follow up to make sure I understood your earlier comments correctly. Is Southwest relying more heavily on call options this year than last?","Tammy Romo","That would be going forward, and that's correct. And in fact our 2018 position only represents call options. That's exactly right.","Gary Kelly","So in other words we were already long with a position for '16 and '17 as 2015 unfolded. So Tammy and her team are continuing to work those positions off as best they can, but then any additional hedges that they're doing, they're doing with the call options to answer your question there.","Jeffrey Dastin","So, the call options are also for 2016 and 2017 in addition to 2018.","Tammy Romo","Actually anything that we've added, just to be fair to your question, well\u2026","Gary Kelly","Yes.","Tammy Romo","The majority of what we've added in 2015 has been call, because all we have is 2018. But yes, I think that would be fair.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And Ms. Rutherford, there appears to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda Rutherford","Thank you so much Tom. If anyone in our media community has any follow-up questions, please reach out to us 214-792-4847 or shoot us a question over to www.swamedia.com. Thanks, and have a great afternoon.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining."],"19357":["Southwest Airlines Co.

My name is Tom and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call to discuss our second quarter 2016 results. Joining the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements, because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section at Southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Marcy, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings call. As we speak, we are recovering from a system-wide Southwest technology outage that occurred yesterday about 1 PM, there was a network equipment failure and the planned redundancy or backup failed as well, and this hindered the recovery efforts, and especially with some of our older legacy systems.","Ultimately, the network was virtually fully recovered and restored around 12 hours later, roughly 1 AM or 2 AM this morning. And since then, the operation and that is airplanes and flight crews and customer re-accommodations have been working to catch up. I want to apologize to all our customers that were affected yesterday and today, this is absolutely not the kind of service that our customers expect or what we expect of ourselves.","And of course our 50,000 employees, jobs to serve our customers became significantly more difficult as a result of the computer failure, and I do want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their collective efforts to recover, those efforts have been truly heroic. So, hopefully after a day of recovery, things will be back to normal tomorrow morning.","Tammy's going to take us through the quarterly results and I just wanted to point out a couple of highlights. First of all, we had a record performance in many ways, traffic, revenues, load factor, earnings, return on invested capital; it was a very strong quarter also in terms of customer service and operations.","Next, we had very solid revenue growth on 4.8% growth in capacity, and that was driving industry leading but modest unit revenue growth of 0.6%, and that was in line with our expectations.","Revenue trends have been up and down all year. Now we're seeing softer fare trends in July, August, and notably with close-in bookings, given overall industry revenue and capacity trends that we've been monitoring, none of this is shocking, but it is disappointing.","We're still anticipating strong third quarter margins and profits, strong cash flows and continuing shareholder returns, but we will need to factor these softer trends into our future plans. So, for now, our second half 2016 plans are unchanged, but we'll continue to look carefully and evaluate our 2017 growth plans.","2017 is going to be an exciting year; we have the 737-8 being launched next year, we've got new technology being deployed next year, we are opening an international terminal at Fort Lauderdale, we've gotten our preliminary approvals to serve three cities in Cuba, and we have an outstanding request to add Mexico service to LAX. So a lot of exciting things going on and certainly 2017 is going to be a very big year.","I want thank our people for all their hard work and the tremendous success in driving these results, and also congratulate them on another quarter of record profit sharing. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Tammy to take us through the quarter.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone.","We are pleased with our second quarter earnings results, which were an all-time record quarterly performance. Our GAAP net income was a record $820 million, and excluding special items, our net income increased 9.6% year-over-year to a record $757 million and we grew our earnings per share almost 16% to $1.19. This was a little shy of consensus, but it was right in line with our expectation and the guidance we provided last month at our Investor Day. Our operating margin of over 23% represents a 36-year high performance. And we grew our pre-tax ROIC excluding special items for the 12 months ended June by more than five points to 33.5%.","I'd just like to also join Gary in congratulating our outstanding employees on our 13th consecutive quarter of record profits, excluding special items and their record quarterly profit sharing of $206 million. This brings our profit sharing accrual to $361 million for the first half of the year alone.","Second quarter revenue performance was a significant driver of these strong results. Our operating revenues grew 5.3% and our passenger revenues once again grew to record levels. The growth in our revenues exceeded our capacity growth, resulting in unit revenue growth of 0.6%, which was in line with our guidance.","This RASM performance outperformed the industry and on a stage-length adjusted basis, our RASM performance was even better. Despite the challenging fare environment, our core business was solid, with strong demand for our low fares. Load factors were at record levels throughout the quarter and we closed second quarter with a record load factor of 85.6%.","Revenues related to Rapid Rewards continue to be very strong. Our second quarter results reflect a net benefit of approximately $135 million related to the amendment of our Chase agreement, effective in July last year.","Our strong revenue performance was also supported by continued growth in other ancillary revenues. Corporate sales were also strong, although at softer yields. We continued to benefit from tailwinds from our development markets, and we're very pleased with their performance, especially in light of the challenging fare environment.","International markets continued to perform in line with our expectations, with several of them producing revenue results well above system averages. Our freight revenues were in line with second quarter of last year. So, to close revenue, we are very pleased with our record operating performance.","So turning to our third quarter revenue outlook. Thus far, traffic and booking trends remain strong, but the fare environment continues to be a challenge. We're seeing heavy discounting in fares including close-in, which as we noted in the release has softened in recent weeks.","Based on these trends and our current bookings and including the yield trends we're expecting third quarter RASM to decline in the 3% to 4% range year-over-year. And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing benefit from the Chase amendment and 2Q's approximately $135 million benefit is a reasonable run rate for 3Q. But we won't see the 2 point to 3 point year-over-year RASM improvement in future quarters, of course, as we've lapped the July 2015 amendment date. We currently expect third quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from third quarter 2015.","And now, I'll move over to our cost performance. Our second quarter costs were right in line with our expectation. Our operating unit cost excluding special items decreased modestly year-over-year, largely from lower jet fuel prices. Despite a 4.8% increase in our capacity, our fuel gallons only increased 4.1%, reflecting our fuel efficiency gains, largely from our fuel modernization efforts.","Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 10.4%, to the lower end of our guidance of $1.80 to $1.85. And based on our market prices as of Monday and our current third quarter hedge position, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be approximately $2.05.","We're also currently forecasting that level for fourth quarter. This brings our estimate for the full-year 2016 to the $1.90 to $1.95 range, which is down a bit, due to the recent drop in market prices. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio beyond third quarter 2016, based on prices as of Monday, is a net liability of approximately $775 million.","And excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our second quarter unit costs were also in line with guidance, up approximately 2% year-over-year. This increase is due largely to the acceleration of the depreciation of the Classic fleet, the timing of advertising and technology investments along with airframe maintenance. Based on current cost trends, we expect third quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to also increase approximately 2% year-over-year.","Roughly 1 point of that year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classic retirement with the remainder associated with increased salary, wages and benefits costs from ratified agreement since third quarter 2015 as well as costs associated with technology projects. For full-year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit costs excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation.","And I am going to move now to our balance sheet and cash flow and I'll just make a few quick comments regarding the strength of our balance sheet and as well as our cash flows. Our cash and short-term investments were $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter. As we reported at Investor Day, we deferred $1.9 billion of aircraft CapEx to beyond 2020 as a result of our recently restructured order book with Boeing.","Our capital spending remains on track to reach approximately $2 billion this year, with $1.3 billion in aircraft CapEx and about $650 million in non-aircraft capital spend. With operating cash flows of $2.7 billion, thus far this year, and manageable capital spend, our free cash flow has remained strong, enabling us to continue to return value to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.","To quickly recap, what we discussed at Investor Day. Last month, we completed our previous $1.5 billion buyback authorization with a $200 million accelerated stock repurchase program in May and launched a $500 million ASR under our new $2 billion program, which was authorized by our board back in May.","We completed that ASR last month and we intend to launch another $250 million accelerated share repurchase here soon. Once launched, we have returned $1.6 billion to shareholders this year and we will have a $1.25 billion remaining under our authorization.","Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases remains in the low-to-mid 30% range. And I'll just make a few comments on our fleet, but we have not had any changes to our plans since we announced the restructuring of our order book with Boeing last month at Investor Day. We ended the quarter as planned with 719 aircraft in our fleet and continue to anticipate ending the year with the fleet of 723 aircraft.","We are still managing to an average annual net fleet growth for the three years ended 2018 of no more than 2%. And as Gary has mentioned, our year-over-year capacity growth for this year remains unchanged in the 5% to 6% range. While we continue to evaluate a rate of capacity growth beyond 2016, especially in light of the current revenue environment, we still expect annual capacity growth in 2017 and 2018 to be less than this year. We remain disciplined and our approach to growth with a focus, of course, on flexibility to adjust, if needed, with a goal to preserve our strong returns and margins.","And now just to quickly recap for you. This was another quarter of record profits, outstanding margins and strong cash flows. Demand for low fares is strong and we continue to produce record load factors. The revenue yield environment remains challenging with heavy fare discounting. We are working hard to control costs and this year's inflation and non-fuel cost is explained almost entirely by the depreciation associated with our accelerated retirement, and we still expect cost savings and an EBIT improvement of at least $200 million.","Lower fuel prices continue to benefit earnings, but second quarter earnings would've improved with or without the benefit of lower fuel prices. Our balance sheet is strong as ever, and our commitment to return value to shareholders is unchanged, having already returned as much in the first half of 2016 as we did in all of 2015. And of course, we also announced in this release, our intentions to launch a $250 million ASR.","Our capital spending remains in check and are very manageable, and pre-tax return on invested capital was just phenomenal at 33.5%. As we look ahead to third quarter, we are expecting another quarter of strong margins. And with that overview, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for another fantastic quarter and for their extraordinary efforts over the last 24 hours. So, Tom, with that, we'll be happy to open it up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. And thank you for waiting. We'll begin with our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Hey, Gary, I appreciate your comments about 2017, I think you said you're monitoring the situation closely and obviously trying to determine what the right amount of capacity growth will be for next year. But when I look at sort of the guidance for the latter part of 2016, I think fuel's going to be up year-over-year, CASM's going to be up and it also looks like RASM could be down a bit. Why no change or move away from the 5% to 6% growth for this year? I mean is it a systems issue that you can't change the schedule for the latter part of 2016, or what's holding you up, or maybe preventing that, any color, your thoughts on that that'd be","great? Thanks.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, and sure Mike, and a very logical question, one that we know that we're going to get from you all here today. We're different than the industry. So, we don't publish 330 days' worth of inventory and the other aspect of the \u2013 our competitors' approach is they mostly over-schedule. So, they'll publish more, they'll claw that back and we just don't use that technique as you know. We don't publish as much inventory and what we do publish we very much intend to fly. So, we rarely go out into a published schedule and make changes.","It is easier for us to hold a few flights in reserve and then publish them later, as opposed to taking flights out and re-accommodating customers. So, it is a \u2013 I don't know if it's so much a philosophy, but it is certainly a practice that we've used. The modeling that we've been \u2013 and second, the trends that we are complaining about this morning are very recent, and that's one reason that I mentioned to you all in my opening remarks is that we've seen inconsistent trends over the first seven months of the year.","Really going back to December, Tammy, I think of last year. So, we don't know that weeks will make a trend, the bookings right now for the fall were quite good. I wouldn't want you to conclude that that means that we're predicting positive unit revenue comparisons yet in the fourth quarter, but what I mentioned earlier that I was disappointed, that is our goal, our goal is to have positive unit revenue growth every single quarter and certainly for this year. We're falling short of that right now for the third quarter and that obviously will give us a cause to rethink our plans.","The final point is, as we have discussed this in recent weeks about the opportunity to reduce the schedule primarily in the fourth quarter, we've not been able to model a scenario where it was profit positive for us to do that. And so this \u2013 in dealing with these incremental capacity choices, we think that actually would be harmful to Southwest in the near term as opposed to helpful. So I think the more productive work effort for us right now, on July 21, is to think about our next schedules and what our plans are for 2017. So hopefully that's responsive to your question.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's very helpful. When does that next schedule roll out? What's the next schedule rollout date for you guys?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, what are you working on right now?","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","We're working on the basically the spring break \u2013 post-spring break period, and that'll be published here in the next couple of months.","Mike J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Very helpful. Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Tammy, what does your 3% to 4% guidance assume as we enter the shoulder periods? One of the other carriers gave guidance that assumes some improvement in September. Are you also assuming a similar improvement or are you more cautious as we enter into shoulder periods, I know a lot of these changes have been rather recent but just trying to figure out what your base case is in the down 3% to down 4%?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Julie. Yeah, as we look forward, September does look to be a little bit easier comparison. But what our current forecast represents is really just a continuation of the trends that we're seeing here more recently. So, as we updated you at Investor Day, we knew our year-over-year comparisons were going to be difficult here in the second half, simply because of the lapse of the Chase agreements, but we have factored in the recent softening that we've seen particularly in our close-in bookings.","So, we've \u2013 it's our best guess on our current trends, and obviously, we'll keep you updated as we move along here in the quarter.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And is there a tailwind from developing markets in the third quarter guidance or has that lapped at this point?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's lapped largely simply because we're getting back down to a more normal percentage of development market as a percentage of ASMs.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But year-over-year, yes, the developing markets are definitely down, but they're being overcome, if you will, that improvement is being overcome by increasing fare competition. So, obviously the industry is continuing to add capacity every month. And we can get the traffic, but we have to work hard with fares do that. The nice thing is we're seeing, in terms of more positives, we're seeing good strength with our corporate sales, very nice growth there, our Rapid Rewards program continues to grow very nicely, and those are sort of outside of the \"fare environment\" and then our ancillary products continue to grow. And that's primarily EarlyBird and the upgraded boarding product. So, we have a couple of tools. And I guess the other thought was that freight was relatively soft in the second quarter. So, hopefully, there'll be some opportunities to regain some growth with the cargo business there.","So we'll have a number of things that we'll be looking at to try to boost revenues, but certainly as time goes by here this year, the tailwind of the developing markets, I agree with Tammy, it's going to continue to wane, but we have some \u2013 we're 4% in development this year, and I think this time last year, it was closer to 20%.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Julie, just to be clear, back to your question on trends. What was implicit in my comments on September is that we would assume a little bit of improvement there just simply because of comparisons, but we've done our best to extrapolate current trends out into the full quarter.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then have you guys talked about how much of your booking curve is weighted towards this close-in period, where you're seeing the weakness?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. We haven't.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think we've talked about it.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We haven't shared that, Julie.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey, thanks for the question. So mine is real simple, can you give us a sense today for quite simply how you're going to grow, what the growth rate is in 2017 or even in the first quarter, as we try and model revenue and perhaps a recovery from this softer spot? What should we be punching into models for next year?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What I can give you right now to help you out is what we have through what we've got published with our schedules. So we are currently published through early March next year and our scheduled ASMs are up in probably the 6% range, and February I think is up a couple of percent for February. So that's where we are and as Gary indicated earlier, we're in the process of evaluating beyond that period. So I just don't have a forecast to give you beyond what's out there in the published schedule.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. How about the latest on when you park these Classics, what date should we assume for that and what is the \u2013 I guess, we'll hang around the basket and wait for you to publish at least a full first quarter, but how should we be thinking about the cadence quarterly from that point forward?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'll be retiring our Classics fleet here, as you know, between now and October 1, 2017. So \u2013 and as we described earlier, we'll be down to a manageable number of Classic and you can think of it as those being all out of our fleet by our fourth quarter schedule. So, we're still working through all of the details on that.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","So would ASM growth be higher or lower for 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q than this mid-singles rate that we're at now?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, all else being equal, just simply because of the fleet, you would expect that to go down now. Again, Duane, we're just working through all of the details for next year's schedule. So, as we sit here today, I'm just not in a position to give you exact year-over-year ASM guidance for next year. But as we go through the year and as we work through the Classics, particularly in the second half, all else being equal, you would expect that to bend down.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. And if we think about how Southwest revenue might hold up in a downturn, obviously there's a lot of data from prior cycles, but are you more of a corporate carrier, more reliant on that close-in customer today, given all the progress that you've made on that side of the business, than maybe prior downturns?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think so. What's interesting is, if you go back 20 years, we were, as you know, such a short-haul carrier. And I think what a lot of people misunderstood back in the 1990s is how much business travel we had, and some of that again was very natural with the short-haul orientation we had with high frequencies, those were convenient schedules that were built for business customers. So I don't \u2013 if anything, I'll bet you that we're less reliant on business customers today than we were 20 years ago. Business travel, as you know, is very sensitive to the cycle, and \u2013 if that's where you're going with your question.","The other tool that we have today to help manage through softer periods is we just have better connecting capabilities, and a lot higher load factors today than we did 20 years ago. So, I still think that we're very well positioned for a change in the cycle. I think we're obviously a low-cost producer, and have a low-fare brand, we have a very loyal brand, and people do travel during recessions, they just look for more bargains. So, generally that's worked very well in our favor in the past.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Gary, for those thoughts. I mean, do you think that's where we are or is this industry dysfunction on pricing?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, I was just trying to be responsive to your question. No, I don't think that's where we are. I think GDP growth is pretty steady. It's \u2013 you all know all the macros, real GDP is 2%-plus and domestic industry seats are up closer to 5%. So, I think that's not anything new, we've been talking about that for quite some time. And as I mentioned in my remarks, I don't think it's shocking that we find this sort of ebbs and flows of fares. But right now, it's \u2013 we are at a spot where, in particular with the close-in pricing, fares are softer than what we were expecting.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon. You spoke earlier about the expectation to get back to positive RASM, or the hope, I should say, to get back to positive RASM in the fourth quarter. Can you speak to what you're seeing perhaps in your forward bookings and the potential revenue levers that you all have that could allow that to happen? Just sort of curious of the puts and takes there.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm glad you asked me the question. So, let me try to make sure that I'm being clear. I am not predicting positive RASM, I'm not remotely suggesting that, that is a possibility based on what we're seeing right now. I'm simply acknowledging to you all that that is our goal, that was our goal for the year and we're falling short of that goal and we can't be happy about that, that's all I was trying to point out. What we are able to do, in the meantime, of course, is continue to sustain very strong profits. We're enjoying low fuel prices and very strong operating margins are our expectation here for the third quarter. I don't have any reason to believe that that will change in the fourth quarter, but we have initiatives that come online in 2017 that bring with them the opportunity to boost our revenue production.","So, we're in a period here between now and then, where we're just going to have to focus on blocking and tackling good revenue management, excellent customer service, tweaking our route network to try to use those levers here for the next several quarters. I think all the capacity questions that we're getting here today are very appropriate and that's something that we're going to have to take a very close look at. I agree with Tammy's point earlier, if that is one of the main levers that we have, we're just not prepared to give any 2017 guidance yet. And of course, I'll just remind everybody that last year, when we did guidance well in advance, it was \u2013 I think it was somewhat misunderstood.","So, we've got to work to do in 2017, we've got the goal to boost unit revenues in 2017 and based on third quarter trends, we've got a little work to do.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that, Gary. And then, I guess a follow up for Tammy. The maintenance line has been relatively elevated in terms of year-over-year growth for the past, I guess, three quarters now. How should we think about that line trending in the back half of the year and would you anticipate giving some relief there as you retire the Classic fleet and take delivery of your next gen aircraft next year? Just sort of how should we think about the maintenance line trending going forward?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Jack. Yeah, the maintenance \u2013 our maintenance costs, you'll continue to see that trending down as we retire the Classic fleet and I would expect our maintenance unit costs in the third quarter to show some improvement as well. So we'll continue to see a relief in that as we retire our Classic and so we're \u2013 that should be a favorable trend as we move forward.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you again for the time.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Tammy, I'm sorry. Can you please clarify, what you said before about the capacity question, you said something about 6% and a couple percent; I just pulled capacity data in Diio and it looks like you guys are growing ASMs by 1.6% in 1Q 2017, is that not right?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We...","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, that's not right.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, that's not right. We don't have March.","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","A couple of things. We don't have March published and then you also have the impact of leap year here this year.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","So, I think it's just probably missing the month.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, just to be clear, when you said 6%, Tammy's, then a couple percent, I'm just \u2013 what were you saying, how much you're growing, was that just like a January, February number?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, those were just January and February. So, January probably up in, would you agree 6% range in February, up year-over-year a couple of percent.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, because of leap year.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Because of leap year.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Of course, okay. Is there a scenario where you see Southwest growing capacity less than GDP next year?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that would be hard to do. I'm sure that just taking your question literally, I'm sure that there is a scenario. I wouldn't want you to think that it's a likely one, but as I think we pointed out, we don't want to \u2013 we don't see a compelling reason to tinker with the capacity that's published, certainly for the third quarter or the fourth quarter. So, these are recent trends and not ones that we're happy with. And so, as I think we've said several times, we've got some work to do. And as we typically do, we'll provide more guidance for the capacity plans here in the fourth quarter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Gary, I'm just trying to get a sense of how much you have seen the fare environment change from, I guess, your little bit more positive commentary at Investor Day until today. Maybe can you give us some order of magnitude in terms of how much weaker close-in yields are right now as opposed to where they were on average in 2Q and I guess, what can Southwest do to try to fix this problem?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, and as I'm assuming you know well it's \u2013 forecasting airline revenues is always treacherous. So, basically what happens is trends get extrapolated, there is \u2013 we'll start a month with half of the bookings in place that we would expect for that month. So, it's not necessarily a ground up \u2013 from the ground up kind of a forecast. I would say that the guidance that Tammy is offering today for the third quarter unit revenues of down 3% to 4% is much less than what we thought at Investor Day. So we've \u2013 in a short period of time in another words, we've reduced our forecast by 1.5 points to 2 points.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","2 points.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So to 2 points. Now, that's mostly weaker revenues that we're seeing here for July, August. There was a question earlier about September. September does look better than July, August, but it's not anything that we're willing to tell you that you can take to the bank at all. So, the trend could change. We could be overly pessimistic here, it is most of the change in the trend as, again we've attributed it a number of times here today to the close-in bookings. And that is just simply saying that our \u2013 we have a lot of competitors out there the week of travel that are offering very hot fares, and we must match to get that traffic, it's just that simple. So that is a change in technique and a change in trend for us. The all-in result is still quite good, still falling, still \u2013 as I said before, it's just below our goal.","The only other thing that I would mention is that there is a consistent quarter-to-quarter decline in revenues. Going back now all the way to probably the second half of 2014 when we began to see lower fuel prices. So, we're off-trend in the third quarter compared to second quarter, and the second quarter is also off trend compared to where we would expect to be relative to the first quarter. So these are, not having talked to you a lot personally, we call these sequential trends; you probably use the same term or technique. And that is basically the technique that we are using to arrive at this prediction of down 3% to 4% in the third quarter.","So, we'll take steps to try to arrest these trends and to get back to positive unit revenue comparisons and again, as I've said a couple of times, we've got quite a bit of work to do to try to \u2013 to get back there, at least here in the near-term.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you for that color, Gary. And my second question, I guess, you mentioned in your remarks that you have not gotten to a scenario where taking capacity out as profit accretive. I guess how much further would unit revenues have to fall in order for capacity reductions to make sense?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm sorry, I just \u2013 I can't do that math in my head. And again my answer with Mike Linenberg earlier was specific to the fourth quarter. So, we looked at some fourth quarter capacity changes that we could make and none of those looked productive to us. So, it will be \u2013 we'll spend our time better working on 2017. So, the hypothetical you're asking, I'm not \u2013 I can't readily answer, but clearly that's something that we want to look out here for 2017.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Gary, I realize I'm probably walking a thin line with the question, but I've heard you say a couple of times with regard to the fourth quarter at least that taking some capacity out, anyway that you sliced it wouldn't be profit accretive for Southwest. I mean I think if you look at what we've seen from some of the other carriers this quarter, most of the legacy carriers are trimming capacity. We can argue about what is the earliest you'd want to trim from the perspective of your customers, but those capacity cuts do likely help Southwest some way. And DOJ will, of course, complain about illegal price collusion or collusion of capacity levels, but there is also the opportunity, it seems, for some legal coordination, so to speak, on capacity levels and on pricing in the industry. And your comments suggest to me that you're perhaps resistive to playing that game. And I guess I just wonder, with Southwest having grown to be as large a player as it is in the industry today, isn't it kind of required that overall the industry is healthy in order for Southwest to be healthy?.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know what Darryl, I think I'm just not going to comment on your question.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I appreciate it, but I'm not going to comment.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Well, let me ask a simpler one then. Are you seeing any advantaged fares in the market today? And if so, what is your strategy for competing?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the advantaged fares are just a fare. It's a technique, it is a low fare. We predicted 15 years ago that all carriers were going to \u2013 have to become low fare carriers. It is a very competitive environment and carriers use a variety of techniques to offer low fares, that's from the lowest-cost carrier to the highest-cost carrier and that changes all the time. And we don't talk about our techniques and we are certainly not going to comment about our competitors' pricing techniques.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take a next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon. Just , Gary, well-worn question here on the call. But I'm just trying to understand something here, just from Southwest's perspective related to your comments that you were saying that if you're looking at industry capacity and then you were growing just as much as the larger players in the market that you were surprised but not disappointed. And what I was wondering is what you were hoping to see when you're growing supply like 3 times faster than GDP. So I'm just wondering what the expectation was? And just if this is just not \u2013 is this from a Southwest perspective, were you just adjusting to a new lower fuel price environment? Why you would be surprised if you're growing so much faster than GDP, and then Southwest isn't moderating capacity. I think most of your competitors showed moderating capacity into the end of the year, what the expectation was?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Savi, when we were having the same conversation three months ago, this was not the topic. So, we've got a change in trend. We'll need to evaluate that and see if we need to make some adjustments. I'll remind you that we had some secular opportunities to step up our growth in 2014, 2015. The added capacity that's coming online here this year is very modest, I believe, Bob, it's about 2%. So, you got the carryover effect of increasing the flying for the Wright Amendment, taking on the flying of the slots that we acquired for Reagan and LaGuardia. And then launching international service, which was a function of integrating AirTran and then what is true expansion, any way you look at it is launching international service as an example out of Houston Hobby. So, you have the full year carryover of that from the fourth quarter of last year.","So we are, as we've said many times, we peaked in that capacity growth in 2015, we're coming down here in 2016 and now I think we're getting into a point where for 2017, we need to be thoughtful about how fast we grow. The other thing that's going on with our capacity is a fairly significant changing gauge. We're not adding a lot of trips. We're adding more seats than trips because of the up-gauging, and then we're getting a little bit more productivity per airplane per day because we're flying a little bit longer, so there's just less time sitting on the ground.","So, all of those are adding up to more available seat miles than, I think, really tell the story about our growth, but I don't know \u2013 again as I've said, we're not shocked that this is where we are. We've been leading the industry consistently with unit revenue performances and I think has very much justified our growth. We've got record earnings and record returns on capital, so we have a little bit different economic and fare environment here that we're seeing in July, and again, we're going to react to that, and stay tuned.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And if I can follow up, Gary, then. As you talk about kind of looking into 2017 and kind of filling out your plans, is the opportunity to maybe shift more to international growth if domestic environment doesn't pick up here after September in that, because if I think about it, you're already retiring your Classic fleet. And if I remember correctly from your Investor Day, I don't think you have many retirements until 2023. So just what's the flexibility over the next few years to really kind of flex up or flex down capacity plans? Or is it just a mix between domestic and international?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, no, we have the absolute flexibility to flex up or down. And then we have tremendous flexibility to allocate capacity around the country or add or subtract international for that matter.","As I think about the international, that's higher risk and truly expansionary, that's real growth. What are wonderful opportunities for us to add capacity remain in the domestic markets with our point-to-point system, either adding frequencies in markets that are spilling traffic or alternatively, connecting to cities with new non-stop service; that has much lower risk than adding a new Caribbean destination. And that is part of the reason that as we look at \u2013 just taking the fourth quarter as an example, why we don't see a profit positive move that close-in given that we already have this fixed capacity, you already have the employees, we've already got the airplanes, we've already got the corporate overhead, it's real hard to justify pulling in the capacity that close-in. So we're much better served to look a little bit farther out where we can impact the cost in more of a variable way and avoid the capacity increases that way.","But we have plenty of opportunities to grow the airline. And whether we need to be growing at GDP or something faster or slower are all things that we're going to have to continue to judge, and I'm just not ready to give you an answer today.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Appreciate the thoughts, Gary.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Gary, the impression that investors have is that your priorities at the moment might be somewhat out of order. The impression is that passengers come first, then labor unions, and then shareholders. And that's certainly fine when all is right with the world, and it certainly worked well under Herb. But during a time of industry crisis, and I would suggest that's what current revenue trends imply, most companies would consider revisiting their sort of priority order, at least in the short run. So my question, as awkward as it may sound, is this. Are you prepared to suspend all labor negotiations until we solve for the industry's revenue crisis?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. No. I appreciate the question, but the premise I would push back on. I think that certainly more than any other airline \u2013 and I'd put us in there with top-notch industrials, we have done a very fine job of trying to balance the needs of all of our constituents. And we've taken very good care of our shareholders. And it's interesting that you describe the current period as a time of crisis when in the first half of this year, I believe we've had all-time record shareholder returns \u2013 in six months. So, if that's a crisis, I'll take it.","But the notion that we put one over the other is an unfair characterization. We must have good employees, we must take good care of the employees, we have a very intensive business and we truly care about people. We care about our people and then in turn we care about our customers. And it is a virtuous cycle, and to think that you can simply ignore that and say, we're only going to focus on the shareholders, doesn't work, it's not sustainable. But we're famous for telling everyone, and admitting, that's who we are and we're just not \u2013 we're not going to apologize for that. It's worked; this is the most successful airline in history, that is now turning out record earnings. And so we want to sustain that. We want to sustain the returns for our shareholders and the best way to do that is to continue to take very good care of our people.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Second question \u2013 and thank you for that, Gary. I knew it was a challenging and potentially differentiated line of questioning. Second question; you've got weak PRASM. As Tammy pointed out, you've got load factors at record highs. You've inflicted a pretty sizable fuel headwind on yourselves. And you're guiding to a year-on-year earnings decline. So why do you routinely ignore initiatives, industry initiatives intended to restore pricing stability? Or put differently, why does Southwest potentially choose to be part of the problem instead of part of the solution? Thanks in advance.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I am unclear as to how we are part of the problem. So, feel free to elaborate and I'll do my best to answer.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, I know you like to stay clear, understandably, of specific pricing questions. But sitting out the last Delta-led $2 to $5 one-way initiative, which at one point or another every other airline in the States participated in. I realize now I'm veering in Darryl's direction, and \u2013 but I mean, that sort of thing.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think you've arrived at his destination.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I will defer answering that question as well.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","What I would just roll up to though here, is rather than talking about any specific pricing or specific capacity questions that are really, as we all understand, off limits, our goal is to have positive unit revenues and we have seen that become \u2013 through the first half of the year we were doing a pretty good job there. The second half of the year now has emerged as more challenging for the reasons that we have articulated and I think it is incumbent upon us to figure out what we are going to do about that and we have all the tools that you are aware of. We have pricing, we have ancillary revenues, we have our capacity, and then of course new revenue initiatives, and we'll take a very close look at all of those and see what we can do to hit our goal.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think we had a decent \u2013 I don't think we have a reasonable prospect of having positive unit revenues in the third quarter. It probably is difficult to assume that for the fourth quarter. So that doesn't mean we won't make a hearty effort in that regard, but we'll certainly be looking very closely at that for 2017.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I do appreciate it, Gary. Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes sir.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much. Gary, just, I guess pretty simply, if RASM is down again 3% to 4% in fourth quarter, is that bad enough for you to cut capacity next year? What's the threshold that you're kind of looking at?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think again, I know you all are pressing for specifics, we're just not prepared to give you that kind of a capacity outlook for 2017 or a bright line. I'm not happy with down unit revenues of 3% to 4%. And hopefully that tells you what you need to know. I'm interested to see if those trends continue and then we will take action accordingly.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then Tammy, what's the \u2013 just as we sit here today, what's the expected fuel hedge loss in 2017?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The full loss, let me see if I have that handy. As I have the fair market value beyond third quarter, which I provided, which was $775 million, the net liability, you're asking for our total portfolio, which would be a net liability of $775 million beyond third quarter. Is that your question or are you asking for a break-down between...","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","No. Just \u2013 I guess just for 2017, just how to think about how the loss is going to impact 2017.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. For 2017 is about $550 million range.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.","Linda B. Rutherford - Vice President and Chief Communications Officer","Good afternoon, Tom. Thank you very much. I'll go ahead and let you give instructions for folks to queue up and we'll go ahead and get into Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. And thank you for waiting. We will now begin with of first question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Hey, good afternoon, Gary. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the technology outage, the computer outage you had yesterday. And what sort of assurances do customers have that something like this won't happen again? It seemed pretty catastrophic yesterday.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That is a very fair question. I think we have hard work (62:25) to answer that because we do have significant redundancies build into our mission-critical systems and those redundancies did not work. I think we need to understand why and make sure that doesn't happen again.","Every company has its challenges and things will break. We just need to make sure that they break and can be fixed in such a way that it doesn't have that kind of impact on the customer experience. So, we've got some work to do to restore confidence in our customers. We're obviously very passionate about serving our customers and determined to never have that happen again.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","Can you say a little more specifically, like was this an equipment failure that then sort of cascaded through your different systems? Or was it just everything kind of went down?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Mike, you want to describe it?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it was a router failure in our network. And the recovery mechanisms did not work as planned with that router. And it slowed the rest of the applications down to such an extent that they weren't usable.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And to my knowledge, we haven't had anything like this in our history. So, this is something that is unique for us. What we do understand is that the \u2013 some of our older legacy applications were the culprit, whereas a lot of the newer technology did recover as planned, but it's also integrated in networks that, again the whole system did not, it was not recovered and restored. Now eventually, it was, and there all of that was fixed through the course of 12 hours and over the course of 12 hours, multiple things were attempted to try to recover very quickly and ultimately they sort of went back to bedrock and rebooted everything, is probably a simplest way to describe it in layperson's terms.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And I would also add that router failures are not uncommon.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","And so, but the severity and duration of this on our operations was, as Gary said, extremely unusual and we're trying to dig into that detail to understand that better.","Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram","All right. Thank you so much for the details. I appreciate it.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Well, shockingly it's about the same topic. And I think you covered a lot of the ground that I was going to ask about. But just again maybe if you can take one more try and being as specific as you can. What is Southwest doing, either things that were already in the works or new steps since the failure, since the outage, to prevent a recurrence? This is your second one now in less than a year.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's a fair question, David. I think this is \u2013 we're not even 24 hours into this. So, the first priority is to get the operation back up and running and serve the customers right now that need to get where they want to go. So that is our priority. Then to take a step back and understand why all the redundancy that we have invested in did not operate, that comes next. Mike, I don't know if you have any more information. Mike has been more involved with this as our Chief Operating Officer than I am, so.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","So, David, we need to, as Gary was saying, we need to jump in and understand exactly what happened in this specific event. We will then have \u2013 add that learning to our recovery profiles with the intent, as mentioned earlier, with the intent of making sure that our recovery happens quicker and the issues don't expand quite like they did in this event. So, that's the first thing. The second thing that we're doing and have been doing is we are making significant investments in our technology, we've talked about, our Lone Star program, we've talked about our other operational investments, and all of those are going to bring our infrastructure and platforms up to a more up-to-date technologies. And that will allow us to recover faster than what we've been to do in this particular event.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay. I know it's early. Any chance you would speed up that investment timetable?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the investment timetable, I don't know. I think in terms of \u2013 I think the simplest way to describe this is, you can relate to power and a backup generator, where if the power goes down for whatever reason, you flip a switch and you've got a diesel generator that kicks in. So that conceptual backup did not work. And we need to understand better why that is, and we're just not prepared to do that yet. In terms of accelerating our investment, we're making significant investments in the technology already.","And that \u2013 we've been talking about that, David, for some time, the need to do that. We have a legacy reservation system, as an example, and that is a major undertaking, and one that we're all looking forward to having that replaced next year. So, it will over the next three to five years, we'll have significant replacements of our legacy systems. I think we're already moving as fast as we can and in the meantime we'll just need to make sure that our business recovery processes are robust and will support the situation when another router breaks, because inevitably one will.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay. Thanks, very much.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Velotta with Las Vegas Review-Journal.","Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review-Journal","Good morning, Gary. Do you have any estimates on how much the outage is going to cost you in terms of vouchers, overtime, equipment replacement, that type of thing?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We do. I think it's a little bit premature, but we're having a very good day today in terms of our business, but obviously with the system being down yesterday, we couldn't take bookings. So, I think that we'll be able to recover much of that, but that \u2013 just that alone may cost us in the $5 million to $10 million range on a net basis, but we've got some work to do to recover bookings for the future that we would have gotten yesterday.","So, Bob Jordan is here, I'll let him speak to this, but he is doing a couple of things to do more than just say we're sorry for our customers, and one of those is we're extending the fare sale that we had planned to end tomorrow, I believe. So, he is extending that a week. But Bob, do you want to talk about a couple of the things that we're doing?","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Sure. As Mike talked about, priority one is obviously to get back up and operating and then right attached to that is to make sure we take care of our customers. So, everybody affected yesterday and it's going to continue today. So, all of our customers affected yesterday and today, we'll be contacting every one of them in some form here over the next couple of days and handling them.","In addition, we just posted a full week extension of a major sale that we have going that was intended to end today. So, we're going to extend that for a full week to make sure everybody has access to those great fares, again that we're going to end \u2013 the sale was going to end today. So, \u2013 but again, priority one is to take care of our customers. So, everybody affected will be hearing from us.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I just wanted to add on to that quickly, Rich, yes, we're worried about the financial impact of this, but what is far more important is the inconvenience that we caused our customers yesterday and today. And I feel very bad about that, we're very apologetic, and we want to just work hard to again restore their confidence in us.","Richard Velotta - Las Vegas Review-Journal","Thank you.","Operator","And that is the final question we have today. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda B. Rutherford - Vice President and Chief Communications Officer","Thanks for joining us. If you all have any other questions, you can reach us at www.swamedia.com, and we will route that to an on-duty spokesperson. Thanks so much.","Operator","And that concludes today's call.

My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me on the call today is Gary Kelly, Southwest's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and President of AirTran Airways; and Laura Wright, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will begin with opening comments from Gary, followed by Laura, providing us a review of our fourth quarter results and current outlook and then Bob providing an update on the AirTran integration.","As a quick reminder, Southwest's full year 2011 consolidated results include AirTran's results since the May 2 acquisition date. Prior-year consolidated results do not include AirTran. However, in order to provide what we believe to be more meaningful year-over-year comparisons on today's call, we will also be discussing specified results on a combined basis.","Combined results is the sum of Southwest and AirTran's stand-alone results for all periods prior to the acquisition, without any retrospective application of purchase accounting.","In addition, outlook commentary will be provided on a combined basis as compared to combined prior-year results, unless otherwise noted. We provided supplemental financial information on a combined basis for full year 2011 and for prior-year results in this morning's press release, along with related reconciliations.","Please be advised that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current content, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","This call will also include references to results, excluding special items or non-GAAP results. Please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","And now I'll turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary C. Kelly","Thank you very much, Marcy, for that very thorough introduction, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are obviously pleased to report a profit for the year that represents our 39th annual consecutive profit of $330 million, $0.43 a share x items. That's always a good thing in our tough business. We are very pleased to report a fourth quarter profit of $66 million or $0.09 a share x items, which is $0.01 better than Wall Street estimates. ","I want to thank all of our employees. 2011 was a very historic year for Southwest Airlines and for the most part, we accomplished what we set out to do and it's all due to their tremendous efforts. So I want to thank them first and foremost.","We had an outstanding record revenue performance, and it helped blunt the very significant rise in jet fuel prices, 33% increase in jet fuel prices. But so far, at least our strong revenue momentum is continuing in the first quarter for the most part. That was really the story all year long in 2011, very strong revenue growth, but not quite sufficient to completely offset what ended up being about a $1.7 billion increase year-over-year in jet fuel costs.","So the resulting decline in earnings, while it is explainable, it's certainly not satisfactory. Our plan for 2012 calls for a significant increase in revenues and profits, and that assumes -- use that word, that assumes that our revenue plans work and that we contain cost increases to manageable levels. And in particular, our outlook for fuel prices in 2012 is pretty benign, always subject to change. And that comes with a very quick caveat that we fully admit, that energy prices are something we just can't predict.","We have no plans to grow the fleet, and certainly until we hit our profit targets and certainly no plans to grow in 2012. Our network plans in that respect are conservative, and they're geared towards boosting our unit revenue performance. Through August of this year, Southwest has only one new city planned and that is Atlanta, as everyone knows, which will start service for Southwest Airlines at least, next month. And obviously, that is an important first step of the AirTran integration.","AirTran will be closing cities this year that are not profitable. And at least through August, AirTran plans to add just 2 new cities and those are international, Cabo San Lucas in Mexico City. ","As I mentioned before, we accomplished a great deal in 2011. We launched our completely revamped All-New Rapid Rewards program. It is off to a tremendous start, and I think that we will begin to see very significant revenue benefits from that program here in 2012.","We opened up 3 new cities within the span of 2 weeks. Of course, we closed on our AirTran deal and then we ended the year with a very big deal with Boeing and GE.","For 2012, for many of you it may seem like it's old news, but it's going to be a huge year for us. First of all, we want to continue our focus on the operation, the quality of our operation and our customer service. They are both performing at very high levels and again, I'm very, very proud of our people. In terms of improvement, we'll be focusing on improving our productivity, improving our efficiency to blunt cost increases.","I already mentioned All-New Rapid Rewards will continue to focus on growing our membership and growing the revenue per member in that program. But in terms of new business, we're planning to receive our single operating certificate here in the first quarter. And at that point, the real integration of AirTran, the visible integration of AirTran can begin, so that will be a lot of work for us this year to begin the conversion of aircraft and airports and employees from AirTran into Southwest Airlines.","That all implies that we'll have big schedule changes occurring within the AirTran unit throughout the year. Many of those, again, are already published after August. Of course, we're launching the 737-800 in the first quarter of this year. That's a very big deal for Southwest Airlines and brings with it quite a bit of change. We announced 2 days ago that we have a new Southwest experience, the new in-flight cabin experience upgrade that we are planning for the 700s. We will begin to see the impact from the new Boeing agreement that we came to agreement on in December. You'll see those financial effects flowing through the year. We plan to pay down more debt, and that's on top of 2011's debt paydown, all post-acquisition. So a lot of things are occurring in 2012. And again, I feel like our folks are very much up to the task.","In addition to those things in the background, we'll continue construction of technology. And in particular, to make sure that Southwest Airlines has the capabilities to fly international over the next couple of years. We're bringing in 33 new airplanes. We're going to retire 40. So you'll actually see a decline in the fleet from where we stand today through the end of the year. Again, that's probably more mechanical than anything else. We grew the fleet a little bit in 2011. We're pretty much ending up in 2012 where we had initially targeted because we did push some retirements from '11 to '12.","So again, I wouldn't read anything into that other than mechanically, that's just the way the retirements match up to the acquisition of the new aircraft.","As we said in the release, we've got $1.3 billion of capital spending planned that I believe is unchanged from what you all have heard from us before. No external financings are planned. We're clearly managing for free cash flow and very much continuing to focus on driving shareholder value.","We have a $500 million share repurchase authorization and of that, we have 225 remaining. Very pleased with our liquidity, $275 million -- sorry, I can't read my own writing. That is $275 million remaining. Very pleased with our liquidity of $3.5 billion, plus our untapped revolver of $800 million. Very pleased with our balance sheet leverage and how it is rapidly declining. And again, just very pleased overall with our 2011 performance and the momentum we have coming into 2012.","So with that hopefully very quick overview, let me just turn it over to Laura Wright, our CFO.","Laura H. Wright","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone, or afternoon to some of you. Our fourth quarter GAAP's net income was $152 million or $0.20 per diluted share. Excluding special items, we reported earnings of $66 million or $0.09 per diluted share, including the anti-dilutive effect of our convertible debt.","As Gary noted, this exceeded our first call census estimate by $0.01. Special items during the quarter consisted primarily of $107 million net related to noncash hedging gains and $21 million net of taxes for AirTran integration expenses, primarily related to consulting fees and our cancellation of XM radio.","Our full year 2011 GAAP net income was $178 million or $0.23 per share. And excluding special items, our 2011 net income was $330 million or $0.43 per diluted share. ","Our pretax return on invested capital for 2011 was approximately 7%. And I agree with Gary, 2011 was a big year for Southwest and I would also like to thank all of the employees at Southwest and AirTran for their hard work and their many accomplishments in 2011 that enabled us to announce the results that we are telling you about today.","On the revenue front, we had a strong fourth quarter revenue performance. We set a number of fourth quarter revenue records. Those included operating revenues, passenger revenues, passenger yield, passenger unit revenues and total unit revenues.","Our operating revenues were $4.1 billion, and our passenger revenues were $3.9 billion, which was a $915 million increase or 31% up from last year's $2.9 billion Southwest-only results.","About 2\/3 of the passenger revenue growth was attributable to AirTran, and the remaining 1\/3 or $300 million was organic growth at Southwest.","On a combined basis, our passenger unit revenues grew 8.2% in the quarter versus last year, and our total unit revenues were up 7%. Our October combined PRASM was up close to 7%, November combined PRASM was up close to 10%, and our December combined PRASM was up 6% to 7%, as previously reported.","During the fourth quarter, we corrected the income statement allocation at certain of our revenues from the sale of frequent flyer points associated with our Chase credit card agreement. The reallocation didn't change our total revenues or bottom line, but was simply a shift of revenues from the other revenue category to passenger revenues. This rate class totaled $46 million for January through September. However, there was an additional $13 million that we re-classed for October and November subsequent to our reporting our monthly PRASM results.","On a monthly basis, re-class has about 0.5 point or less benefit to PRASM. Our December PRASM that we reported already reflected the reallocation at the time we reported our traffic.","During the fourth quarter, our yields are up 8.5% on a combined basis and our yields at AirTran outperformed Southwest in the fourth quarter. They were up almost 17% year-over-year.","We've made significant improvements in the AirTran revenue management structure already, even before optimizing the network which begins this year and before connecting the networks later this year, both of which will also bring significant revenue potential.","Our average fares on a combined basis were up 10% as a result of 8 fare increases we've taken since the fourth quarter of last year. Despite the increased fares, our load factors have continued to be strong, with an 80.5% fourth quarter combined load factor. That was down 0.2 points from last year's record fourth quarter load factor.","Our mix of full-fare passengers in the quarter at Southwest was 17%. The number of Southwest full-fare passengers were down about 1% in the fourth quarter versus our third quarter, and that is significantly better than the average sequential drop in fourth quarter full-fare passengers versus third quarter. ","Looking at several measures, all indications are that our corporate travel turns are stable. This also evidenced that over time, many different business passengers are purchasing travel and other fare categories, impacting our full-fare mix versus historical trends.","Our Business Select fare product had another strong performance with $22 million in revenues for the quarter. Our Wright Amendment revenues were $56 million in the quarter and $240 million for the full year, up from $217 million in 2010. And based on the revenues and the strong booking trends thus far in January, we expect our January passenger unit revenues to increase year-over-year, 7% to 8% on a combined basis.","February is currently on a similar pace as year-over-year pace this January, but we do expect to have more difficult year-over-year comparisons in March due to the timing of Easter.","Our fourth quarter freight revenues were $36 million. That was up 13% over last year. And our fourth quarter other revenues were $212 million, which decreased $24 million as compared to fourth quarter 2010 combined results.","Our fourth quarter EarlyBird revenues increased $7 million to $36 million, and the full year EarlyBird revenues were $142 million, far surpassing the $100 million annual target that we set when we launched the product.","We currently expect our first quarter 2012 freight and other revenues to be comparable to our fourth quarter 2011 freight and other revenues.","Now turning to fuel, again, the year-over-year decline in our fourth quarter earnings, excluding special items, was largely driven by higher energy prices. Our fourth quarter economic fuel costs per gallon including hedges and taxes was $3.29 at 34% increase over the prior year. Our unhedged fuel price per gallon was $3.17.","The increase in our fuel expense in the fourth quarter due to the 34% increase in fuel price per gallon was approximately $380 million in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, the increase in fuel bill due to the higher prices was $1.6 billion.","Our fourth quarter premium expenses related to fuel hedging, which are recorded below the line in other gains and losses, were $14 million in the quarter and that compared to $44 million a year ago.","The market value of our hedged portfolio at December 31 was a liability of $44 million. That compared to a liability at September 30 of $660 million. And as of January 17, the value of that hedged portfolio is an asset of approximately $100 million.","Now looking forward on fuel, we utilized a similar strategy for the first half of 2012 hedges as we did in the fourth quarter of 2011, where we've reduced our floor exposure, we reduced our premiums and also reduced our hedge protection. As a result of these actions, for the first half of 2012, we had minimal protection but in the second half of 2012, we've got meaningful projection for WTI prices in excess of $100.","In turn, we were able to reduce our current premium review spend for 2012 to $48 million. That compares to a $114 million spend in 2011 and a $162 million in 2010 on a combined basis.","In the first quarter 2012, our hedged premiums are approximately $6 million, and the hedge premiums in the second quarter are approximately $5 million.","Based on the market prices as of January 13 and our existing hedged portfolio, we currently expect our first quarter 2012 economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $3.35 per gallon range. This includes an approximate $0.12 per gallon hedging loss.","Our full year 2012 fuel cost estimate, again, based on the January 13 forward curve is $3.30 per gallon, and the full year unhedged fuel cost estimate is $3.22 per gallon.","Our hedge position in 2013 and '14 provides significant upside protection, although at today's backward-dated prices, the market value of our positions is modest. These hedges provide meaningful protection to us if prices increase to the $105 and above level.","As we move away from our years with 2008 losses, we have 2013 and our last year of the legacy hedge, we intend to keep our annual fuel hedge premiums below $100 million and build a portfolio that provides catastrophic protection upon appropriate market conditions.","Now turning to our nonfuel costs, on a combined basis, our fourth quarter operating expenses excluding fuel and special items, increased 2.7% versus last year. And on a unit basis, they increased 0.5%. This was better than our 2% guidance, primarily due to lower maintenance costs and lower advertising spend in the fourth quarter.","For 2012, we currently anticipate a modest unit cost increase, excluding fuel, profit sharing and revenue-related costs on a combined basis, primarily due to salaries, wages and benefits, maintenance and airport costs. However, our 2012 PRASM will also be impacted by a couple of items related to our fleet replacement initiatives.","First, the refresh of our 737-700 interiors, which we're calling Evolve, the cost of that retrofit will be expensed versus capitalized, and we currently expect $40 million to hit maintenance expense in 2012 and $20 million to hit our maintenance cost line in 2013.","Second, with our decision to accelerate retirement of our 737 classic fleet, we've shortened their expected useful life, which has increased our classic depreciation expense in 2012 by about $50 million.","We're very excited about the series of fleet announcements that we've made over the past couple of months. Certainly this week's announcement regarding our decision to retrofit our 737-700 fleet with the new customer and environmental-friendly interior, along with the 6 extra seats, is the final step of the much larger fleet initiative.","Collectively, the combination of the new 737-800 with the Sky Interior, the Evolve retrofit on our 700 fleet, the acceleration of our 737 classic retirements with MG and Max replacements delivers a handsome financial return, allowing us to reduce our operating costs and also produce more revenues.","We've reduced the fuel burn by 6% to 7% by replacing our classic aircraft with the NG and by 17% to 18% with the Max. As our classic fleet has aged, the annual maintenance cost has increased due to a higher level of inspections and the average annual structural maintenance expense for our oldest classics is around $2 million per aircraft annually.","Additionally, the newer airplanes will reduce the average service time and increase our aircraft productivity. All in, the financial impact of our fleet modernization program easily exceeds our 15% return-on-investment criteria, accounting for the capital costs for replacement and the financial costs associated with shortening the classic lives.","We anticipate the combination of fleet initiatives will conservatively produce a mid- to high-single digit cabin improvement upon completion of the Evolve retrofit program and upon having about 100 -800s in our fleet.","The revenue potential for the Evolve program is conservatively in the $200 million annual range, and the 800s with 28% more seats also provides the opportunity for hundreds of millions of additional revenue. And we currently have 78 of the 800s on a firm order delivering between 2012 and 2014.","For 2012, we expect the contribution to earnings before tax from these collective fleet programs to be about $70 million, taking into account the $40 million maintenance charge for the retrofit and the accelerated depreciation. The contribution to 2013 EBT is expected to exceed $300 million, again accounting for the additional maintenance expense. And by 2014, when the Evolve retrofit is complete and we have a substantial number of the 800s in our fleet, the expected EBT contribution is in excess of $500 million.","For 2012, we're also expecting a significant decline in our non-operating expenses, with our interest expense expected to be down almost $60 million on a combined basis due to the retirement of $1 billion of debt since the AirTran acquisition. Additionally, we're expecting a significant decline in our hedging premium expense for fiscal 2011, again with our 2012 premiums at $48 million versus $114 million in 2011.","We remain on track to realize the $400 million of net synergies related to the AirTran acquisition in 2013. Net revenue gains remain a primary contributor. However, now that we're 8 months into the acquisition, we currently expect that our cost synergies in the aggregate and on an annual basis will exceed the expected cost of synergies from increased labor costs.","The estimated labor cost to synergy in total is approximately $150 million, and that is expected to be phased in between 2012 and 2015.","For 2012, we're currently forecasting net synergies in the $200 million range, with the net-net revenues 2\/3 of the contribution and net costs the remaining 1\/3.","In 2011, the net synergies realized were approximately $80 million, split evenly between revenues and costs. The revenue gains were from revenue management actions on pricing and inventory management, and the cost savings were in corporate overhead, maintenance contracts, renegotiated financing contracts and insurance and general procurement.","We ended 2011 with $3.1 billion of core-unrestricted cash and short-term investments, net of fuel hedged collateral deposits provided to counterparties of $226 million. During 2011, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations, with $400 million of free cash flow. We repaid $638 million of debt during 2011. And as a result our leverage, including off balance sheet leases, is approximately 47%, down from just over 50% after acquiring AirTran in May.","Our 2011 CapEx was $968 million. This included approximately $40 million of capitalized costs that were related to the acquisition and integration of AirTran. ","I wanted to quickly point out the increase on our balance sheet and our air traffic liability account. There is a $257 million increase that relates directly to our All-New Rapid Rewards program. The cash sales from points sold to our business partners during the full year increased $250 million versus 2010, and the vast majority of this revenue is deferred, thereby increasing our air traffic liability and this will be recognized into passenger revenues as flights that occur in the future.","For the fourth quarter alone, our cash partner sales increased over $100 million. Again, showing that this new program is producing very strong results.","As of yesterday, our cash had grown to $3.5 billion, and we continue to have an $800 million outline of credit fully available and undrawn. As Gary pointed out, cap spending for 2012 unchanged at $1.3 billion and debt maturities of $560 million planned for 2012.","Let me quickly finish with a fleet and capacity overview. During the fourth quarter, we took delivery of 3 -700 aircraft from Boeing, and we retired 4 of our 300, 2 of which were on leases, ending the year with 698 airplanes. In 2012, we will take 33 airplanes, all 800s, 5 which will be released from a third party. The first of our 800 deliveries are scheduled for March. We have 2, and the remainder are pretty evenly spread throughout the year.","With the 40 retirements planned for 2012, we will end the year with a fleet of 691 airplanes. And we still expect that our 2012 combined available seat capacity will be relatively flat with our 2011 combined capacity.","In the first quarter of '12, our combined capacity is going to be up about 1% versus last year. That's mainly attributable to an extra day in the quarter, with this being a leap year. In the second quarter, our capacity is expected to be down 1% to 2%.","These forecasts that we're providing today include our current forecast, which includes the impact of the AirTran aircraft transitions that are going to begin in the next few months. It also includes the addition of a larger gauge -800 airplanes and the additional seats from the recently announced Evolve interior on our 700 fleet.","Our schedule currently published through August 10 does not reflect the additional seats of Evolve and the 800.","And with that, I will turn it over to Bob Jordan for an integration update on AirTran.","Robert E. Jordan","Well, thank you, Laura, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today.","I'm very happy to report that overall, our AirTran integration is proceeding on track as planned and is on time.","I want to begin by thanking everybody at both Southwest and AirTran for their hard work and dedication to the integration. They have kept their eye on the ball by running one of the best operations in the industry, while staying focused on the integration plan. In fact, 2011 was AirTran's best operational year ever, with on-time performance for the year at AirTran of 84.8%. And in December, which is typically a very tough month with winter weather, AirTran's on-time performance was 91.9% which is the best December ever, beating previous December by nearly 10 points.","There was an equally strong performance in mishandled bags and complaints, so I'm just absolutely pleased with the people of AirTran for these results.","On the integration front, optimizing our joint network continues to be a significant focus with scheduled publication lead times. Most of that doesn't really show up until 2012. But by improving overlap markets and repurposing less profitable flying now, we are creating the opportunities to improve our network returns, and some examples include our announcement during the fourth quarter of new 2012 AirTran service to Mexico City in Cabo San Lucas in AirTran -- I'm sorry, Southwest entry into Atlanta that begins next month with 15 daily flights ramping up to 18 daily flights by the summer.","In total, based on our joint schedules currently published through August 12, we will serve 103 cities on our combined networks, providing significant revenue potential when we have the capacity and capability in place to connect the networks in 2012.","We have completed 22 of 31 shared city transitions, co-locating our operations side by side. And a number of these shared cities, we have also in-sourced below-the-wing operations to Southwest ramp personnel. We've harmonized our passenger services vendors. We've harmonized our DIs programs. We've merged maintenance facilities in Orlando and Baltimore during the fourth quarter. And construction of the Atlanta cargo facility has been completed and is scheduled to open in conjunction with our service start-up there on February 12.","We began to harmonize policies and procedures in the fourth quarter, including things like sporting equipment and select fees for UMs and pets, for example. We've also harmonized our large-scale maintenance contracts, for example GE and Honeywell, and those that resulted in substantial cost synergies, as Laura has already covered.","On the labor front, our pilots ratified their seniority list integration agreement in November. Our flight attendants, mechanics and flight instructors have reached tentative SLI agreements that have been sent to membership for ratification votes, and these are just absolutely huge accomplishments and I want to commend our people for their focus and their ownership of this key step of getting the SLI proposal out for a vote.","As you all know, seniority list integration is absolutely a crucial part of our integration plan, and it's wonderful that we can move forward with this without arbitration.","We are also very excited to be on track with the integration just overall, especially the receipt of our single operating certificate, which we are still expecting in March of this year. And overall, we entered 2012 well positioned to begin the real heavy lifting of aircraft and station conversions, larger network moves, many of which are already in upcoming schedules.","Overall as well, I'm just very pleased with AirTran's financial performance, as Laura mentioned. AirTran's marketing, revenue management and network planning activities have been managed by Southwest since early last fall. And through the combination of modest network changes, the utilization of Southwest revenue management tools and techniques, we are seeing substantial year-over-year RASM increases at AirTran each month. And the acquisition was modestly accretive to our 2011 results as we had planned.","And finally, I would like to close with a historic milestone that's been reached just this week in our integration efforts. The very first group of AirTran employees officially joined the Southwest family. And I, for one, am extremely excited with this integration milestone. It just moves us one step closer to the day that will become one airline.","And just on a final note, I had the pleasure of spending yesterday in Atlanta, just working the terminal there, talking to a lot of our AirTran folks, and I can assure you that the AirTran employees remain as enthusiastic and optimistic about joining Southwest Airlines as they have from the very beginning, and that's just a absolutely wonderful thing.","And with that, Tom, I would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And we'll now begin our question and answer session. We'll take our first question from Bob McAdoo with Avondale Partners.","Bob McAdoo - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Guys, just a couple of quick ones. When we think about this flat capacity for 2012 in the context of adding 6 seats to airplanes and whatever, when you say flat, is that flat in ASMs? So therefore the plane miles is dropping? Is it flat in plain miles, therefore seat miles are increasing? How should we think about the word flat, given the changes that are going on in the fleet?","Laura H. Wright","So Bob, when we say flat capacity, we're talking about available seat miles on a year-over-year basis. So certainly, we have more seats either being phased in, but we have airplanes being integrated, going through conversion at AirTran and we have and as we noted, we're actually going to be down net for the year, so that's flat ASMs.","Bob McAdoo - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the second thing is you talk about the nonfuel costs being up in this quarter and in this year, how much of that is what I guess you would call kind of normal inflation kind of things versus the fact that you'll have by the end of the year some AirTran airplanes that are converted? And I think we've all talked about how the AirTran system, when it's converted, will have higher costs and higher RASM. How much of it will be tied to the growth of -- the conversion of AirTran airplanes by the end of the year? Or how many AirTran airplanes would actually be potentially even converted by the end of the year? How far along would the process be?","Laura H. Wright","So I'll answer the first question, then we can answer the second. So if you look on our 2012 plan, the impact of AirTran, I noted we have net synergies from the revenue and the costs so this the good guys, bad guys, that's about $200 million. So net-net, AirTran's integration is not creating the cost inflation that we talked about. It's primarily from inflation in our salaries, wages and benefits, which is contractual rate increases and step increases. We also are expecting some inflationary increases on the airport costs this year and maintenance. Those are really the 3 big drivers, but it's not being caused by the AirTran integration. Second question was the -- Bob, you were talking about the integration of the airplanes for 2012?","Robert E. Jordan","We currently have the plan of the aircraft integration and modification start, assuming again that we achieve SOC in March as planned. Those will start in late March, early April. The current plan is to begin and complete about 13 of those next year, put those back into the Southwest network of about 13 of the 737s. So from a capacity impact, those will be retrofitted with the new Evolve interior, so we'll move from 137 to 143. But on a capacity basis, it's a very modest impact. Those 13 aircraft moving from 137 to 143 have a very, very, very modest impact on the capacity change.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ray Neidl with Maxim Group.","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Yes. Just looking at your program for the stock buyback. Is that because -- I know you had strong cash flow, but are you required to do that for the employee compensation stock that you give to them? And will that be permanent? Is that something you're going to keep up for the employees? And then regarding the debt buyback program, again you have strong cash flow, but you're doing that basically -- why would you buy back your debt? Or are you doing that basically because you're trying to keep your investment grade rating and you're not comfortable with your balance sheet, even though your debt-to-capitalization ratio is low?","Laura H. Wright","The first question, which was the share buyback, it is not related to any of our employee stock program. No requirement. That was just a decision that our board made as we've done in the past based on excess cash and trying to enhance our shareholder returns. So second question was the...","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","The debt buyback.","Laura H. Wright","Oh, the debt buyback. So those were really...","Gary C. Kelly","They're not really buybacks.","Laura H. Wright","Not buybacks. We didn't go out in the market. They were debt maturities. Certainly, there was debt associated with AirTran that was called upon the acquisition that's included in there. But when we acquired AirTran, we were very clear that they had much, much more leverage and more debt than Southwest. So I think from day one, we announced our intent to, over the first couple of years, reduce the combined leverage after acquisitions. So we're just completing that plan.","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, that sounds logical. And just as a follow-up but different direction, with AMR going into bankruptcy, do you see any possible opportunities going into the FW?","Gary C. Kelly","No.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, a little over a month ago, maybe 2 months ago now, you did put out a memo to the employees just noting the huge changes the industry's gone through and sort of talked about the challenges that, that might have for Southwest. And as I was kind of thinking about that, I mean, think about your cost structure. What I kind of get challenged by is obviously, not much you can do in the long term on fuel. Your employees and your planes seem pretty productive. So I'm sort of, I guess, struck by the notion that maybe it suggests that we've got to kind of reassess compensation expectations. But maybe you can talk through a little bit of the logic at what you see happening there, what your hopes were to sort of achieve with this.","Gary C. Kelly","Well first of all, it was just -- as you well know, it was the truth. And it was really a reaction to the events across town, of course, but also a misunderstanding of whether it is an opportunity for Southwest or whether it presents more challenge. And so I was simply trying to address that. The fact is that our hey rates are higher now than anybody else in the industry by quite some margin. We make that up, obviously, by increased productivity. So we need to sustain that, and to the extent that we have become less productive in areas, which has happened. Things change over time, Bill, and we do have opportunities. We need to re-energize ourselves and then certainly to the extent that we still have waste that hasn't been wrung out in the company, we want to go and attack that. But I just challenge the premise that there's no opportunities left to improve productivity or improve our efficiencies or to eliminate waste because there are, and we can never be satisfied with that. Now we've got some fundamental opportunities from a, if you want to think about it as a policy perspective, to improve our productivity. We can refresh our fleet and certainly replace less efficient, less reliable aircraft with more efficient, more reliable aircraft, and that was a fundamental component of the fleet strategy that we announced roughly a week or so later. So I think that puts that into context. So we're certainly going to pursue those kinds of opportunities. In terms of scheduling airplanes on a daily basis, we've done a lot over the last couple of years to trim schedules, but there is available aircraft time if we can be more innovative and clever in finding ways to successfully market that time, especially late in the evening. So we have those kinds of basic opportunities as well.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Well one of the things that comes up a lot, obviously, is now that Americans and maybe we should revisit some of the consolidation stuff and you've seen in the press some suppositions that some of your peers are looking at that. What's the appetite at Southwest for further M&A? Obviously, you've got to get through the AirTran acquisition. But once that's done, sort of how do you think about what your long-term, I guess, comfort with further acquisitions is?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I don't think we're comfortable in speculating what we might or might not do in terms of any kind of a deal. I think we would certainly admit that we have a strategy. It's an energetic one. We have a lot of work planned, certainly for not only 2012, but '13 and '14 and '15. And we'll only want to commit to work that we feel like we can do in a high quality way and in a successful way. Any time you contemplate a merger, obviously that is a huge undertaking and we're really busy with not only that, but with other things that we have. I would fully admit, and I certainly wouldn't want to try to be cute about this. A hub-and-spoke legacy carrier that has multiple aircraft type, it's not obvious how that would fit for a company like the Southwest Airlines. You know that. We know that. I think what we will clearly do and what we've admitted that we would do is we will pay close attention to any things that do become available, whether it's a simple route or whether it's other assets and we'll be on our toes to move on those if there's some good opportunities. But I can't give you a straight answer as to whether or not we would be seriously entertaining other M&A activity.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one clarification. Are you saying your hands are sort of tied right now or too full to sort of pursue anything, or you could, you have the bandwidth left if something became available to look at it?","Gary C. Kelly","I'm not answering that. So I think that we -- if you asked us if we were busy, I would say yes. But there's a lot going on, and we will always want to do that well and it would clearly be a factor in us contemplating adding anything else to our corporate to-do list. But I didn't go -- I didn't answer the question as to whether or not I thought we had the bandwidth for it. Priorities can be revisited, and so I don't think that -- I'm not comfortable speculating on what we might or might not to in that regard.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Gary, about 6 months ago you said you hit the point where you think you pushed fares as much as you could to be productive, but since then, obviously, the fare environment's gotten a lot better. And you've matched quite a few recent industry increases including one last week, so any value from capacity. So how does demand trend today stack up to what you were seeing then when you said you thought you pushed fares high enough? Is it better? Is it about the same? Is it worse? Is visibility better? Any kind of color on that will be great.","Gary C. Kelly","Hunter, I think the 6 months -- well, 6 months ago, when Laura and I put ourselves back in the August time period talking about our second quarter results and the current trends, we were a little confused at that point in time with what we were seeing demand-wise. I think since then, we've clarified with our third quarter and fourth quarter results that demand has actually continued to be quite strong. So we had a little midyear chop for whatever reason there. But third and fourth has just been very steady, very stable, very strong and that's what we\u2019re seeing so far here in January. It's a very good environment. The macro environment, everything we read every day feels better than it did there when we were having the debt crisis, and I think everybody was spooked by a number of things that were going on there. So absolutely, things feel much more stable, much more consistent. Laura's already reported here this morning or this afternoon that we're looking at 7% to 8% unit revenues gains yet again here in January, so I'm feeling pretty good.","Hunter K. Keay - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And I wanted to just ask a quick one on the other revenue line. I realized there was some restatement, I should say, some reclassification of revenue but even factoring that in, I think you guys were expecting, if I'm not mistaken, mid- to high-single digit growth, but it came down about #10%. So I guess, what drove that above and beyond that reclassification? And is it possible that maybe we're starting to see some of that back fee revenue dissynergies sort of pop up there? And how should we think about modeling that going into next year?","Laura H. Wright","No, Hunter, it was -- really, the difference from the guidance that we gave you was reclassifications. It was the reclassification we talked about, and it was also higher deferral percentages on our business partner income, which were actually up more than we expected, we're just deferring more of it into ATL, but we did not see any dissynergies in the numbers for the back fees that you're talking about. So it's really related to the accounting for the business partner income.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Gary, I'm still trying to reconcile the generally bullish demand tone of this call with the fact that you have blocked several industry fare increases in recent months. This isn't a question about future pricing. I'm just trying to get a handle on what you've seen in the last 2 or 3 months. As Hunter pointed out you did take a long haul increase, but you've resisted attempts to move up fares in the kind of sub-1,500-mile market. How do we reconcile that fact with what you're saying? And would it be wrong to read into this that shorter haul demand might be under some pressure relative to longer haul?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, it's probably a similar answer to one I gave to Bill. I won't talk about pricing tactics either in the rearview mirror or going forward. We want to be the low fare leader. We're very pleased with our no-hidden-fees positioning. I think that's worked very, very well for us. And then it's down to managing market by market, and most markets have fairly significant competitive situations underway. But otherwise, I'm not comfortable giving any particular insight. I would say that with the exception of sort of the middle of the year, we've had a very strong revenue performance and a very strong revenue environment. We are, in 2012, about to begin managing quite a bit of churn in the AirTran, Southwest route systems. We're trying to pay very close attention to that. Overall, macro wise, we're feeling pretty good about the economy and our own performance. I think what we've all been -- don't lose sight of the fact that what Laura was reporting about the AirTran unit, and that the AirTran yields as a unit are up almost 20% at times. So these are just facts that I'm illustrating that while we didn't take the fare increase, we got a much higher yielding result through other techniques. So our balance -- as I've said, I'm very pleased with the fourth quarter revenue performance, very pleased with the customer satisfaction. We are managing very carefully this introduction of a brand-new frequent flier program, which I think here at this point in time is going exceptionally well. So all of those things are factors in the way we think about pricing at a macro level. But overall, again, the trends are good and obviously I'm hoping that, that translates into a strong revenue performance here in 2012.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well as a follow-up to that, Gary, since we don't have the DOT data ourselves yet to answer this question, historically AirTran yields across the spectrum of stage length have been lower than yours, they've made up for it with bag fees and the tire loads. But in terms of sort of equalizing the yield performance between the 2 units, you said that AirTran is up 20%. What sort of a current differential, if you're aware of one, between Southwest pricing and AirTran pricing?","Gary C. Kelly","I don't think that there is a -- is or was a fundamental difference in the pricing structures. Now clearly, there are some differences. If one sits down and studies it market by market, of course we don't have complete overlap either with our systems. But I don't think you'll find a particularly different price fare structure, Jamie. And again, this is all public information. What is admittedly different been between the 2 companies is the mix. Mix of business and leisure, mix of connections and non-connections, mix of full-fare, discount. That is very different. And without using fare increases, we've been able to change that revenue management approach within AirTran, as we have already shared, and that's what's driving unit revenue growth at AirTran. But it's not a fair structure, per se. As Laura's saying, it's execution. So it's how we are utilizing that fare structure that we've been able to make some improvements. I think the Southwest -- I doubt that it's the Southwest brand per se, but it is sort of the Southwest approach and Southwest philosophies that are realizing some gains right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose.","Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","So 2 questions. One is, are you preparing for any or accruing for any wage rate increases for labor as the employees ratify their single less?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think the answer is no. Because as I'm thinking out loud, I'm looking to Bob and Laura here, that implies as a retroactive rate change and we don't do that. So we've done that in the past, but that's not currently in the works. Unless I'm just forgetting something...","Laura H. Wright","But in terms of the cost guidance in our budgeting that we give you, we have expected -- we build into our forecast timing of when we expect some of those equalization to occur. So it's in our guidance, but not in the accruals.","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, yes, yes. I think the big difference is that where you know, for example the pilots, and then where we have a contract out or a proposal out for a ratification, you know what's planned. And so we have those raises and the timing of those raises in the forecast. But there is no catch-up retro, at least as far as I remember, or any group that has either ratified or is in the works, or any group that we hit or any plan for any group that we need to move through SLI in the future. So there's nothing to accrue.","Gary C. Kelly","But Helane, just to make sure we're all 3 understanding your question, we have -- the pilots, we have the deal. So we know exactly what pilots move to what pay rates and when. And as Laura mentioned in her remarks, we're phasing AirTran's integration into Southwest. And therefore, those labor rate changes are also phasing into Southwest between now and when we're done, which will be roughly 2014. Those are all forward-looking, so there's nothing to \"accrue\" in that sense.","Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But the numbers that Laura's giving out for cost guidance includes the -- what you just said, the integrations and the phase-ins, right? So if I'm understanding...","Gary C. Kelly","Yes.","Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then my second question is with respect to the additional seats on the aircraft, is there any way -- I mean, I know capacity is going to be flat and so on. But is there any way to say what the ASM impact is from just adding those seats?","Gary C. Kelly","Sure.","Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Sort of net of return.","Laura H. Wright","We think we can get it to you. We can give you a full run rate when it's all in and as you know, they're phasing in so you get -- you don't get the full impact in your one. So we're -- if you give us some time, we can get you that.","Gary C. Kelly","Otherwise, we'll just shoot it to you. But -- and this somewhat ties into Bob McAdoo's question, the available seat mile forecast is almost literally flat in '12 compared to '11 for the full year. The trips, though, are down and they're down probably 3-plus percent. So it's everything that we've been discussing. You get more seats per departure and you may get a little bit longer distance being flown on average as well. But it's really the additional seats that's making up that gap in trips. And the aircraft fleet itself will be down 7 units, again, as we discussed by the end of the year.","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, [indiscernible] just looking here, it looks like it's about -- for the move to the Evolve interior for the aircraft that will be converted in 2012, it looks like it's about a 0.5-ish impact on capacity.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan McKenzie with Rodman Renshaw.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions here. Southwest has done a lot of network restructuring and implemented a number of revenue initiatives over the past years, but margins still remain pretty frustrated by the high fuel prices. So I'm wondering how willing would you be to take even more aggressive steps, including shrinking the airline further, to hit targeted returns? And I guess, inclusive of the question is do you feel, at least internally, that based on the capacity plans that you have that you can hit the targeted returns that you've outlined in the past?","Gary C. Kelly","Well yes, I think I would agree with what I think you just said as a latter point. I think in the end, I think any management worth its salt has to do what it's got to do. And we're all obligated -- we have a duty to manage our shareholder value here and to hit our returns on investments. So there's some art in agreeing on what that target ought to be, but I think everyone generally agrees with our target of 15% on a pretax basis. So we're determined to do that, number one. Number two, I don't believe that the right way to achieve that is to shrink the fleet, mainly because we have so many opportunities. If we don't like the way our assets are deployed today, we have a lot of opportunities to deploy them in a different way. And I think that, that would -- strategically, it would be a mistake. It's very painful to downsize. There is a cost associated from a goodwill perspective with customers, with employees, with downsizing and so companies do that. Some companies are forced to do that. It's a tool that we have if we find that we need it. I think it is my least favorite tool. The nice thing for us is we're only in 72 cities right now and we are creating more capabilities to be able to serve even more markets very effectively. So that is our plan. And again as you know, our orientation is to fix our fuel cost issue and our profitability challenge and then grow the airline and do it in that way. But if we have to shrink, we have to shrink. But that's certainly not in the cards right now, Dan.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","Understood. And I guess going back to some of the market commentary, if I could focus on just one part of the country, Atlanta stands out as 11th largest city in the country but ranks first for capacity. And nearby Charlotte ranks as the #1 growth market in the United States for capacity versus just 4 years ago. So relative to the rest of the country, capacity at 2 nearby airports has not been particularly restructured, versus just about every other larger market in the country. And I guess given that, I'm wondering what you can share about how that impacts your view of your fifth-largest market, or at least that part of the country?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I'm not sure that I have anything new to add to the discussion. We feel like, and so does AirTran, we feel like we can add value to the Atlanta discussion. We can win customers in Atlanta. We can take existing Southwest customers to Atlanta. We can certainly significantly restructure the AirTran schedule and take advantage of the Southwest network. And that's what we're focused on doing. We've had great success with that approach, especially here in Denver over the last 5 years. And we're the low-cost guy, we're the low-fare leader and we'll be something different in the market. I think the market is embracing that, and we're certainly excited with what we've heard so far. Charlotte, I don't have a whole lot to offer. There is a presence there by AirTran, which means by definition that we'll give it a good hard look. And we have not announced what our plans are one way or the other with Charlotte yet. So it's a little premature for me to address that. But Atlanta, we've been very open. You can't really acquire AirTran without having some idea about what you're going to do in Atlanta. We've shared that and we're about to get started.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we have time for one final question. We'll take our last question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you could talk about your overlap with American auto markets basis.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, we can...","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","What percent of your network overlaps with American capacity?","Gary C. Kelly","It's sort of a direct and indirect question, so if you look at it on an indirect basis, a lot. There's a lot of overlap in Dallas. There's a lot of overlap in Chicago, even though it's not the same airport. We have a lot of overlap with them in California. They have a large presence in New York. But those are the big hitters, I guess, South Florida as well. So there's plenty of overlap. There's plenty of opportunities to gain some share if they shrink. They have made dramatic changes to their route structure over the last 20 years, and Southwest has picked up a whole lot of business. So you know what is underway at Dallas Love Field? We're completely reconstructing the terminal. The Wright Amendment, of course, restrictions drop in 2014, which will allow for a more fair competition out of the North Texas area, too. So there are some things happening there. But, however...","Laura H. Wright","Duane, if you look at the direct and indirect where you count Dallas and Chicago as common markets, it's about a 35% overlap with our capacity.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just do you have total capacity trends in your markets and in competing capacity trends in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter here?","Laura H. Wright","I do have that. Let me get it real quick. Okay, so if we look at first quarter, the total seats in our direct markets are expected to be down about 3%. If you look at direct and indirect, it's the same number, down 3%. That compares to fourth quarter where competitor seats were down 2.6% in our direct markets and down 2.3% when you include indirect. So slightly better comparison in 1Q versus 4Q.","Operator","And at this time, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thanks, Tom, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Of course, as always, if you have any follow-up questions, Ryan [ph] and I are available. And I hope everyone has a great day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Ginger Hardage, Senior Vice President of Culture and Communications.","Ginger Hardage","Great. Thank you, Tom. We know that everyone's ready to now ask questions of Bob, Gary and Laura. So if you wouldn't mind just giving us the routine on how they queue up for calls, and we'll get that portion started right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our first question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein","I had just a couple of quick questions. Laura, I wanted to ask you, I think you talked about an annual hedging spend limit. Was that right or did I misunderstand that?","Laura H. Wright","Yes, what I mentioned was prospectively as we get to what we call clean sheet years, it's our goal to have annual hedging premiums under $100 million.","Mary Schlangenstein","Great. And the second question was, Gary, when you were talking about increasing productivity and eliminating waste and you mentioned potentially looking at some later flights in the day, is there any potential that you guys would start doing some stuff overnight? Or were you just talking about maybe more flights toward the end of your current day?","Gary C. Kelly","I'll let Bob answer that one.","Robert E. Jordan","Well Mary, we don't -- over the last few years, as we pruned out the unproductive flying in the schedule, a lot of that is really early in the day and really late in the day kind of flying for the most part. We have flights, you've heard this before that we just weren't covering our fuel costs, for example. As we've really worked the network and as hopefully we get some economic improvement here in 2012, it does look like there's a chance to begin to stretch the day back out just a bit, add some flying towards the end of the day and the beginning that we may have pruned out over time. I'm not talking about going back to 2007 or 2008, but it does look like we've got opportunities to stretch the day back out just a bit. The second thing, you asked about the overnight or red eye flying. One of the things that we can learn from AirTran is they actually did a fair amount of red eye flying; some of that actually pretty profitable. So the schedules that are in place out through August of this year, we have actually maintained a lot of that red eye flying in the AirTran schedule and are considering some of that for the combined schedules that we'll move forward. It's nothing dramatic. We're talking about 10 to 15 flights, not 50 or 75. But I don't think we've concluded it, so I would not rule out some modest red eye flying added to the mix. But again, it's a fairly small number of flights, and it would make a pretty small dent in our overall utilization and capacity.","Mary Schlangenstein","Okay. And when you talk about just adding some back a little bit later in the day that you had pruned back, so are you talking about flights that generally wind up around 10 or later than that?","Robert E. Jordan","Oh no, we're talking about flights that generally earlier than that, this is a sort of -- and again, it's market by market, but a lot of this we've actually pulled out, 8:00, 8:30, 9:00 flights that just weren't enough in the heart of the day, so it really is market by market. But whether you look at your markets that are strong that can support the additional frequencies, and the planes are used up in the middle of the day, so their frequency would have to be added later, maybe 8:00 versus 5:00. And so we just go market by market, but we are looking at some modest add backs.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","I'm wondering for your Southwest service launch in Atlanta, how are bookings looking whether the load factors like in your mix of premium versus discount passengers for the Southwest branded service here?","Gary C. Kelly","Well the former, we can give you a little insight on. The latter you can't, and I'll at least speak to that. But bookings look normal. And with all new markets, we monitor them very closely and we use reference markets to get some idea. And it's pretty typical for a new city. We have some that are ahead of what you would think, some that are behind what you would think, but overall it looks fine. At this stage with advance bookings, these are all going to be leisure customers for the most part. They could be business customers who are willing to commit to advanced purchase restrictions. But you can't really get any kind of a read based on the booking as to what the purpose of the trip is. So we don't know, but they're all discount tickets right now. One other thing, Kelly, I would mention to you is that when we start a month, we probably have half of the bookings in place for the whole system for that month. So a lot has to happen the week of travel. And it appears to me that Atlanta's not going to be any different in that regard. The only other thing I would say is that just the nature of the itineraries that are being booked we tend to be, as you know, a point-to-point or a nonstop airline, and the bookings suggest that as well. So it looks very normal for Southwest city opening.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Great. And I'm wondering what kind of competitive response you see from Delta and whether that's better or worse than you expected?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, they're one of the largest airlines in the world, and with their #1 market that they serve and so I would expect them to be vigorous competitors and we thrive on competition.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from David Koenig with the Associated Press.","David Koenig","You've talked about first quarter demand, but I didn't hear you break it out between leisure and business travel demand. And I know it's early, is there anything you could say there, even about the first 18, 19 days of the month?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, David, we didn't speak to that, but just talking about what we've seen so far, business travel looks very stable. I don't see it going up or down in terms of the fourth quarter performance. It does feel like we were still lagging in 2007, so it's pretty recession levels with respect to the business travel. But as we've been saying, it is a very healthy performance, the traffic and demand look really good. A lot of the changes that we've made seem to really be working well and in particular, the All-New Rapid Rewards program. So all indications are that business travel is holding up quite nicely. But I don't think we can give you any more insight about January. I would be surprised, based on the overall trends, to see any fundamental change in January. But I think the honest answer is we don't really have any insight into that yet. Was that our last question?","Operator","And yes, sir, it is. At this time, I'd hand the call back over to you for any closing or additional remarks.","Laura H. Wright","Great. Well, thank you all so much for calling in today. If you think of additional questions as your stories develop, you know that we stand by and we'll be ready to get those answers for you. That number is 214-792-4847. Thank you so much for being of the call today, and hope everyone has a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Matthew and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and the replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Matthew and good morning, everyone and welcome to today's call to discuss our fourth quarter and annual 2014 results. Joining me on the call is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Mike Van De Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Ron Ricks, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer.","We will begin with opening remarks from Gary followed by Tammy providing a review of our results and our current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy's remarks. Today's call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","And now I would like to turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Kelly","Thank you, Marcy and good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. Our fourth quarter earnings excluding items were a record, dramatically surpassing last year's previous record by 79%. Our revenues were up $200 million and interestingly enough fuel was down $200 million and the result was a beautiful thing. So for the first time in 14 years, we achieved our ROIC target and in this case we exceeded it with a 21.2% return on invested capital.","The operating performance was propelled by the successful deployment of our strategic initiatives, very pleased with the Rapid Rewards for the year, that was an almost $400 million revenue contribution. The fleet modernization effort for 2014 was $0.5 billion, as was the AirTran integration synergies of $500 million for the year, so we're very pleased with all of that.","Without any one of those of course we would not have had the stellar results that we did, but our people have done a magnificent job managing all the transformational change over the last 5 to 10 years. They are passionate about Southwest, passionate about serving our customers, better than our competitors and with a reliable and low cost operation and I could not be more proud of them, strategic initiatives aside, we would not have Southwest as we know it without these incredible people.","So my thanks to all of them, but also my congratulations to them because they have been richly rewarded. We've had tremendous stock price appreciation. Last year we increased the dividend by 50% and then, of course we had record profit sharing for 2014. So just turning as to what happens next in our business. Our earnings outlook is superb, if for no other reason than fuel costs are down dramatically year-over-year.","Our business remains steady, although I would alert everyone to be mindful of the distortions in analyzing our performance on a unit basis and as we point out, that's caused by the increased utilization of the fleet, the increased stage length, the increase in the gauge all leading to very healthy ASM growth. I also want to remind everyone again of the large percentage of our route system that is under development and that translates primarily to international markets that have been converted from AirTran, the Dallas Love Field expansion with the repeal of the Wright Amendment on October 13. Dallas available seat mile capacity by the way is up over 80% in the fourth quarter year-over-year and also Reagan National which with the slots we acquired, that capacity growth is 180%. So our business has been strong and steady despite all of this large percentage under development.","The collapse in oil prices since September of course, is very big news. I think it's safe to say that we're still trying to digest all of the news and the ramifications for us. Of course, in the meantime, we have significantly lower fuel costs and it drops straight to the bottom line for the most part, but we have been and will continue to actively manage our hedging program given this significant change. We've made no changes to our growth plans for this year. We will of course, factor in the latest and greatest news into our fall planning for 2016 and 2017, but at this point we've made no changes to those years either.","From a cash flow perspective, we're assuming energy cost will be lower than what our fall plan for this year initially showed and therefore, operating cash flow will be higher. That's a high quality problem. We'll be thoughtful as to our uses of that additional cash, but as a footnote, I would add that given the extreme volatility that we're experiencing in the oil markets, it's anybody's guess what will happen next. So we will manage as best we can factoring in that very high level of uncertainty with energy prices going forward.","Again, overall, I think wherever we end up here over the next several years is going to be lower than what we thought before September. So with that, Tammy will take us through our stellar results for the quarter and I want to thank her for her superb financial leadership and just enjoy the review here, Tammy.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Gary and thanks to everyone for joining us. We are thrilled to report today on an outstanding finish to what has been a record year of accomplishment. Our annual net income excluding special items was a record $1.4 billion or $2.01 per diluted share which is an exceptional 80% increase year-over-year. Our 2014 GAAP net income was also a record, $1.1 billion or $1.64 per diluted share.","Gary walked you through all of the benefits from our strategic initiatives and of course, those were strong contributors to these wonderful results. Overall, our annual profits resulted in pre-tax ROIC excluding special items of 21.2% for 2014. We are delighted and we handily surpassed our minimum target of 15% and as Gary mentioned, that represented our highest ROIC since 1981. Our fourth quarter performance was also exceptional. Fourth quarter net income excluding special items was a record $404 million or $0.59 per share which also increased nearly 80% year-over-year and represented our 7th consecutive quarter of record profits.","Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $190 million and operating income excluding special items was also a fourth quarter record of $621 million and we expanded our operating margin by more than 500 basis points to 14.7%. These strong results were driven by record revenues, significantly lower fuel prices and our ongoing cost control effort.","Our 2014 profits earned our employees a well-deserved record $355 million in profit sharing and I just want to congratulate all of our wonderful employees on just the fabulous results which also represents our 42nd consecutive year of profit. I'll turn to revenues now. Our revenue results were strong and better than expected.","Our fourth quarter revenues reached record levels increasing 4.5% year-over-year to $4.6 billion, driven largely by record passenger revenues of $4.4 billion. Strong demand for travel resulted in record traffic and load factors on 2.6% fewer trips year-over-year. Overall, we are pleased with the revenue strength across our network and we saw strength in both our business and leisure travel demand. On a unit basis, total operating revenues increased 2% compared with fourth quarter last year on a 2.4% increase in available seat miles.","Our passenger unit revenues increased 2.6% compared with last year's record fourth quarter which is outstanding considering the 2.6% increase in stage length and the 2.4% increase in seats per trip. Furthermore, nearly 20% of our capacity was in developing markets and that includes our new Dallas non-stop markets which took off very strong with the majority of the new markets meeting or exceeding a 90% load factor. And our international markets also continue to ramp up nicely and performed in-line or ahead of our expectations.","Our fourth quarter passenger revenues included an additional $55 million related to the amount of spoilage expected for points sold to business partners and as our new Frequent Flier program has matured, we have continued to monitor member redemption activity and behavior and during 2014 with a few years under our belt with the new program, we obtained enough historical data under the new program to develop a predictive statistical model and the model indicated an increase in spoilage which was recorded prospectively as a change in estimate.","The higher spoilage rate is expected to continue in 2015, however the revenue impact will not be known until the actual number of points redemption for the period is known. Therefore, the fourth quarter revenue increase does not necessarily represent a steady state quarterly impact through 2015 and without the change in estimate our fourth quarter passenger unit revenues would have fallen within our guidance of the increase of 1% to 2%, but the rate that we expect going forward, of course are factored into the guidance that we provided in the earnings release.","Thus far in January, the travel demand remains strong and based on current bookings and revenue trends; we expect first quarter 2015 passenger revenues to increase year-over-year in-line with our 6% capacity growth which suggests a flat PRASM. While it's too early to provide revenue guidance for full year 2015, as we communicated at Investor Day, our goal is to keep pace with our capacity growth compared with 2014.","Keep in mind, our year-over-year first quarter PRASM results will reflect the impact of an estimated 3.5% increase in stage length and 2.4% increase in seats per trip, both compared with first quarter '14 and 20% of the market remain under development.","For January, we expect strong passenger revenue growth and when coupled with approximately 10% ASM growth, we currently expect PRASM to be down slightly year-over-year, but just as a reminder of the 10% ASM growth, 3 percentage points was due to last year's polar vortex winter storms. This slightly down expectation for January PRASM also reflects about a 2 to 3 point headwind from increased stage engage and maintains approximately 20% of our capacity under development which reinforces the fact that we're seeing underlying strength in January's performance.","Moving to freight and other revenues, freight revenues grew 12% year-over-year primarily benefiting from new and maturing markets as a result of the AirTran integration and we currently expect first quarter 2015 freight revenues to increase from first quarter 2014 in the 6% range. Other revenues decreased almost 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the decline of the AirTran fees as expected with the transition of the AirTran network over to Southwest.","We currently expect the year-over-year decline to continue through the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the completion of the integration process which occurred during fourth quarter. For first quarter 2015, we are expecting a year-over-year decline in total revenues similar to the year-over-year decline in fourth quarter 2014.","The fourth quarter 2014 decline in AirTran related fees was partially offset by an increase in certain ancillary revenues such as Early Bird check-in and our A1 through A15 select boarding positions which are sold at the gate. Our Early Bird revenues continued to be very strong at $56 million for the fourth quarter.","So with that revenue update, I'll turn now and speak to our cost performance. Our fourth quarter unit costs excluding special items decreased 3.8% on a year-over-year basis largely due to the significant drop in fuel prices. Our fourth quarter economic jet fuel price per gallon declined 14% which also reflects a $0.03 hedging loss which was about $15 million.","Our fuel prices have plunged nearly 50% in recent months, as Gary mentioned and in response to the collapse in fuel prices we effectively unhedged our 2015 fuel consumption. For the first quarter, we neutralized our hedge with offsetting hedges which essentially resulted in a $0.10 watch and loss and we are now participating in 90% of the market drop as a result. So very proud of how our Treasury group has managed this really steep decline in market prices.","Based on our hedge position and market prices as of last Friday, we expect our first quarter fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.90 range which is significantly below first quarter $3.08. From mid-September to today's market price, we have participated in 80% of the decline for 2015. For the full year based on our fuel derivative contracts and current market prices, we estimate our 2015 economic jet fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.95 to $2.05 range which would represent $1.7 billion in year-over-year fuel cost savings. So, obviously very substantial.","Turning to non-fuel costs, our unit costs excluding special items and fuels increased 2.3% year-over-year and that was largely driven by the 52% increase in profit sharing expense. If you take out profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit costs increased a modest 1.2% year-over-year. So we're very pleased with the ongoing benefits from our fleet modernization and just overall cost control effort. This was slightly better than expected due to lower than expected costs such as advertising.","Based on current cost trends, we expect first quarter 2015 unit costs excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing to decrease year-over-year in the 1% to 2% range compared with first quarter 2014, 8.5 bps and our full year 2015 unit costs excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing remains unchanged from Investor Day where we provided an outlook of also down in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year.","Moving to our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the year with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments and we also have our $1 billion revolving credit line fully available. We continue to generate strong free cash flow. Our free cash flow for 2014 was $1.1 billion which we returned to our shareholders through $955 million in share repurchases and $139 million in dividend payments.","In fourth quarter, we repurchased $200 million in shares under an accelerated stock repurchase program and we have $380 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. In 2014, we repaid $561 million in debt and capital lease obligations which includes a bullet repayment of $350 million on notes that were due October 1. During the fourth quarter, we refinanced with $300 million in unsecured notes at 2.75% coupon rate which is a historic low rate for us.","Based on -- and in 2015 we intend to repay $182 million in scheduled debt and capital lease payments. Our leverage including off balance sheet aircraft leases at the end of the year was 35% and as you all probably read, we were upgraded by S&P during fourth quarter to a BBB rating and we are the only investment grade U.S. airline for all three credit agencies. We also continue to manage our CapEx with 2014 spend of $1.7 billion plus $80 million of assets constructed for others which was right in-line with our expectations.","For 2015, we currently expect our CapEx spending to decline from 2014 levels and fall in the $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range excluding assets constructed for others which is estimated to be about fall in the $50 million to $100 million range.","And that brings me to a quick recap of our 2014 fleet activity. We took delivery of 33 Dash 800s from Boeing and 22 pre-owned Dash 700s and on the retirement side we retired five Classics this year. We have removed all of the AirTran 717s from service and as of the end of the fourth quarter, we had transitioned 52 717s to Delta and have since transitioned an additional two which brings us to a total of 34 remaining 717s that will be transitioned to Delta in 2015.","In addition, thus far we've transitioned 48 of the 52 AirTran 700s to Southwest with the last four currently in conversion. We continue to manage our fleet plans to a relatively flat fleet through the end of 2015 which is in-line with what we've said previously. So as Gary stated, no change in plans there. So we're managing to roughly 700 aircraft which as a reminder was the combined fleet, roughly the combined fleet count at the time of the AirTran acquisition.","We expect our first quarter 2015 ASMs to increase year-over-year in the 6% range and our guidance for full year 2015 year-over-year capacity growth remains unchanged at approximately 6%. Our first quarter capacity growth is driven by an expected 3% to 4% increase in stage length, 2% to 3% increase in seats per trip and flat trips all compared with first quarter 2014. The additional seats per trip are driven by of course, our fleet modernization effort and are being produced at a minimal cost, so very cost effective growth for us here in 2015.","In addition with the aircraft conversion activity and the phase out of the AirTran fleet behind us, we now have the ability to utilize our fleet more again, generating a low cost capacity that will fund our exciting growth opportunities in 2015 focused on Dallas Love Field, Reagan and LaGuardia and also International.","In closing, we couldn't be more thrilled with the very strong end to 2014 and our record performance for the year. The successful execution of our strategic initiatives have positioned us well for future success and our 2015 is off to a great start. We are pleased with our current revenue trends and as we said at Investor Day, we're intently focused on maintaining our competitive low cost structure.","So far in 2015, we are continuing to benefit from low jet fuel prices, ongoing fleet modernization and rigorous cost control efforts and are well-positioned to take advantage of our exciting growth opportunities. Our balance sheet and cash flows are very strong as evidenced by upgrades in 2014 by both S&P and Moody's and we're very proud of our solid investment grade rating. We've demonstrated that we are focused on prudent capital deployment and we're committed to taking care of our employees, customers and shareholders. And before we open the call up for questions, I would like to congratulate and thank all of our employees once again for these truly remarkable results and an amazing year.","So, Matthew I'll turn it back to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll begin by taking our first question from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Tammy just a point of clarification on the spoilage, I think you said it was not included in the roughly flat PRASM guide. Should I assume that could only if anything be a good guide or because it's an off peak carry potentially could it break the other way or is that already in that flat number?","Tammy Romo","It's already contemplated in there. We do our best to forecast what we expect the rate to be. Now as always, as part of our close process we review all of that, but it is contemplated in our guidance.","Hunter Keay","And please correct me if I'm wrong here, Gary, but I thought maybe in the past when you guys made changes to your hedging program that could sometimes be interpreted as sort of an implied commentary in what you're seeing in your bookings given that there was an underlying assumption that the changes in oil prices over time would be changes -- would be correlated to changes and driven by demand, I should say. So when you take off your hedges for the rest of 2015, I know you're seeing strong bookings right now you made that very clear, but are you doing that because you potentially anticipate some degree of softening in demand as we move through the year? Or is this strictly something different because of what you're seeing in the overall global supply of oil?","Gary Kelly","Hunter, I don't know that we've tried to match our hedging to demand in the way you described, so if you've gotten that from us I apologize. So I think the main thing I would say is we have a hedging program in place as insurance, so it's to protect us against primarily catastrophic, but increases in energy costs. So in doing that we're well protected with that. Coming into 2015 with the hedging program that we had in place, '15, '16 and '17 we're well protected. And in an environment where energy prices drop and especially when they collapse, the hedging program is going to cost us.","Now all-in, of course we're realizing a significant reduction in energy cost and for us that's of course all airlines would wish for this, but for us a low cost producer it enhances our competitive position because it allows the rest of our cost structure to have a more significant proportion of the total. So it helps to widen our cost advantage, so this is all a good thing.","I think the only point about the hedging program is we want to manage the cost of it, so we have unhedged in 2015 because we had a view that prices were headed south and fortunately our folks were right and managed that I think very, very well. So we're not, we're essentially unhedged for '15. We do have positions in '16 and '17 and there is a mark-to-market with the portfolio for those two periods as well that we'll have to continue to manage, but to me, if you were to ask us well, what do you think we should do next? I think we should simply continue to manage our portfolio and not try to speculate on what prices are going to be over the next three months, six months, 18 months. That is anybody's guess.","We've got a scenario where we have very handsome margins. We can put in hedging protection for the future to avoid a catastrophic increase in fuel prices which is well beyond the $45 to $50 range that we're trading in right now and just approach this in a way where the cost of the hedging program is sensible. So with the volatility the way it is, hedging is very expensive and hopefully that gives you a comprehensive answer to your question.","Operator","And we'll go next to Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates","Tammy, just going back to Hunter's question, can you provide any color on what the Q1 PRASM guide would be excluding the benefit from the accounting change?","Tammy Romo","So that's really baked in going forward. We've calculated the rates and they are not that far out of line with what we've been seeing historically. So no, we haven't provided that in the estimates, but that's just part of our normal special steps revenue and that's our best estimate at this time. So no we haven't -- we aren't going to provide that for the first quarter going forward. And again, a lot of that depends on how many rewards ultimately get redeemed as well. So keep that in mind, it's very tough to give you an exact forecast on that, but actually going forward as we get more history with the program, we should be able to predict that with more accuracy, but it's within the normal range of what we've kind of seen historically.","Julie Yates","And then just the other U.S. carriers have noted some softness in domestic customs towards the end of Q4. Do you have any comments on that or did you see a similar dynamic in any of your markets?","Gary Kelly","I wouldn't call it softness. Again, I think the thing that makes us different is the reallocation of all of the AirTran capacity that we acquired back in 2011. That's what's creating this large percentage of quote development markets for us because as you know we haven't grown on a combined basis, we haven't grown the fleet. We haven't grown capacity since 2011.","So what you're seeing in Dallas, what you're seeing in International, what you're seeing in Washington Reagan is simply redeployed, not literally AirTran capacity, but that's a big source of it. So those markets are in development, that's not a euphemism. It's just simply saying they don't typically perform at system average and beyond that no I don't think we have, I would not describe softness to anything that we're seeing.","Tammy Romo","I would agree, Gary. We spent a lot of time looking at our results here in the fourth quarter and when you adjust for the development markets, we have PRASM gains realized really across all haul lengths. We saw strength in both leisure and our business passengers and really, if you back all that out and just look at our base of business on a same-store, if you will, it was a very strong performance. So very delighted with our overall revenue performance.","Gary Kelly","And of course, we keep emphasizing this and you all can factor it in how you choose, but if you adjust as I like to do, for the stage length change and for the gauge change, that's a 2-point adjustment. So it really takes the year which was up 4.6%, it takes us up to 6.6% and the fourth quarter was a very strong performance as well. So no, softness is not a word that makes any kind of sense. Now the change in energy prices is no doubt going to ripple through the oil and gas economy and we serve Texas in a big way.","So I did share earlier this morning in some media interviews that we've not seen any change in the travel in those markets either, but obviously, we're going to keep a close eye on that. But so far everything is steady and we feel really good about the business.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","So on the international side now that you have had more experience flying with Southwest, I was just wondering what the experience has been and if there is any sense of maybe wanting to accelerate the growth in international or just is the opportunity in the domestic market that much better?","Gary Kelly","Well yes, we\u2019re in the wonderful position of having numerous alternatives for future growth. So we, just as a reminder at this point beyond the 48 states we've got close to 50 additional destinations that we can consider. I'll just use 2015 as a proxy to answer your question. We're growing capacity 6%, 5 of the 6 points are domestic and it's driven by Dallas and Reagan, so all familiar themes that you've heard. So we have 1.1% of our capacity today that\u2019s deployed internationally. It's 1.6% if you include Puerto Rico. 1 point of our growth next year will be international, that's pretty measured, that's pretty modest and I think you should expect that's going to continue for some time.","The markets are developing rapidly. We've got a pretty significant increase in capacity compared to what AirTran was flying because we're flying daily and they were flying less than daily, so we\u2019ve factored all that into our expansion plans, but we've announced three more destinations for 2015. We're excited about all three of those. Again, it won't add up to a huge amount of capacity, but we just want to walk before we run. Operationally, we want to be cautious and conservative here and make sure that we're comfortable with flying into different countries and different cultures and different languages. So no change to what we've shared with you all earlier.","Savi Syth","And if I could ask one more, on the cash side, if you do have this excess cash [inaudible] price declines comes up temporarily, is there any kind of non-aircraft CapEx program that you're looking at or how should we think about the use of cash?","Tammy Romo","We really don't have any change in plans based on the drop in fuel. We're going to continue to manage our CapEx and do what makes sense for Southwest Airlines, more or less and irrespective of what fuel is doing. So we feel comfortable with our CapEx plans here for 2015, so at least at this point there has been no change in plans.","Gary Kelly","I would add one more thing there which is we are -- I would say we have an ambitious investment plan already. We've worked hard to transform Southwest over the past 5 to 10 years. We've invested a tremendous amount in technology already. We have big plans of course to replace our reservation system and that will be an expensive project and then Mike Van De Ven is also leading an effort to invest heavily into our operations technology over the next five years.","So even without this additional, if it turns out this way, this additional cash, we are investing heavily and what I would consider to be aggressively in about as much as I think the company can manage. So I don't see an opportunity there that would be wise. So we'll have other discussions about how we could use the cash, but like I said earlier it's a high quality problem.","Savi Syth","Sorry, is it debt or are you returning cash to shareholders on the excess cash?","Gary Kelly","All of the above. So we'll look at those opportunities and I'm not saying that we're going to change our growth plans, so don't miss read what I'm saying, but obviously that is an opportunity for us to refresh those for -- after 2015 and we'll take a look at that or we'll just run a higher cash balance. But if nothing else, it will preempt the need to do any debt financings that we might have been contemplating over the next several years and we do have a fair amount of debt that's coming due over the next 36 months.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Yes, two questions here. Tammy did you in your commentary did you provide how much cash collateral you posted with your hedge counter parties for your I guess, 2015, 2016 positions?","Tammy Romo","Yes, I would be happy to go over that with you. Let me pull up our exact amounts here. So our collateral as of, I guess it's roughly $270 million in cash roughly $200 million in aircraft and so that's the cash in aircraft and $250 million in a letter of credit. So if I didn't provide that I can't remember, but those are the numbers.","Michael Linenberg","And then, when you give us your cash position, does that include the cash collateral that is held by the counter parties or is that?","Tammy Romo","Yes, we include that.","Michael Linenberg","And then just my second question, Gary, it came across this morning on the headlines, I think you were doing the CNBC interview and I think you had mentioned something about competition being the greatest in a generation. And I just, I look at what your ROIC was for the quarter and what other carriers are doing and I didn't know if maybe it was taken out of context, if it meant that you and the rest of the industry was all competing to generate the highest returns and the best margins. Like what did you mean by that?","Gary Kelly","Well, it was intended to be just a straightforward commentary. Our competitors are at lower relative costs than they have had in a generation. They are producing handsome profits unlike they have done in a generation. They're running better operations than they have historically. At least from our view of the world they're stronger competitors, period. And we're mindful of that and it's incumbent upon us to step up our game accordingly.","So it was just an acknowledgment that the competitive landscape has changed where you go back 10 years ago and they were floundering. They aren't floundering now and that's good, that's good for us and it makes us better. So all I was trying to point out is that we're up to that task and I'll put my money on the Southwest people any day.","Operator","We go next to Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker","Gary, can you just give us an update on where you stand with all your labor agreements and your negotiations and how that should work through 2015?","Gary Kelly","I'll give you the headline and then I'll ask Mike and Tammy if they want to fill in some gaps here, but we had three labor agreements reached in 2014, so Tammy can share what the cost effects of those are. We have six others that we have been working on and now a 7th contract has become amendable. So we currently have seven open contracts and it is my hope that we hit all of those negotiated and ratified in 2015. Tammy, anything you want to?","Tammy Romo","No, we've included again, anything that's been ratified and they are included in the results and guidance, but the guidance that we provided.","Helane Becker","Okay. I think though you have some big ones that are in negotiation and have been in for a long time, right? Has there been movement made on like pilots for an example?","Gary Kelly","Well, I consider each one to be big and in terms of numbers of employees, yes we had a number of employees covered, again with our contracts that we reached last year. Well they are all different, so I can't give you a blanket answer for seven negotiations and one is just getting underway. But we have opportunities to do two fundamental things. One is to reward our employees for the very hard work and the stellar results and I'm most anxious to do that. And, secondly, we have wonderful opportunities to better position Southwest to maintain our low cost position and our low fare brand and that's a blessing that we can achieve both of those things. We've done that with some of our labor groups and I am optimistic that we'll be able to do it with these remaining seven.","Operator","We go next to David Fintzen with Barclays.","David Fintzen","If I think back to the Investor Day, as I recall in the fixed ASM growth there is still some that you weren't bringing back all of the slack aircraft utilization right away, if I recall. I'm just curious given the volatility in fuel, is there some room at the margin either in those aircraft or in some of the off-peak flying that you've cut over the last few years to tweak the schedule a little bit in the short term?","Gary Kelly","I don't think so, not really for 2015. I think in theory you might be right but again, like both Tammy and I have tried to reiterate we're not changing any of our plans at least in 2015. We're still very focused on the reliability of the operation that has some impact on the utilization of the fleet. But at least as it stands right now some of this is constrained, so there are aircraft out of service.","The way I did the math guys, was I counted up 88% of our fleet is in service in other words, available to fly\u00a0and \"normally\" that ought to be more in the 93% to 95% range. So some of this is just taking the 717s out of service, some of it is finishing up the AirTran 737 conversions into Southwest. So, David you just have a higher number of aircraft than usual out of service in 2013, even more in 2014 and still in 2015. We can't do anything about that right now. When you get through all of that this year into the fourth quarter, it's theoretically possible we could do a little bit more flying but again none of us are thinking that that's anything that we want to do. We don't have really any thoughts of changing our fleet plans for this year.","If you include the 717s at the end of 2014, we had 701 aircraft and that is literally where we plan to end this year, 701 airplanes. So now, again we'll give some thought to what we might want to do in 2016, but I would just quickly add that whatever we do will be just fine tuning. I don't see us making any dramatic departures from our plans that we had previously.","David Fintzen","And then just going back to the comments on the energy related business, do you know sort of how much you've benefited from some of the shale, etcetera in Texas over the last few years? Do you have a sense of what the pool of potential traffic might be that you'll have to watch or is that just hard to know?","Gary Kelly","That's kind of an interesting question. I don't know that we really looked at it that way. I think it would be appropriate to do that. I can pick on a couple cities where it's pretty obvious that there has been a dramatic boost, but off the top of my head no David; I don't have a sense of that.","And, obviously, we're going to be watching very carefully for any change in trends and as I mentioned earlier I'm sure -- all of us can do the theory here, but consumers are going to have a lot more money in their pockets to travel. So that's a fact and my prediction is that we'll get some of that.","Obviously, oil and gas businesses are going to cut back and that will result in some reduced travel inevitably, but my bet is that the consumers are going to outweigh the cutbacks and you'll still see a very strong revenue environment. I think what is more worrisome about the future is just what's going on around the world and what impact that might have on the U.S. economy and what impact that might have on consumers and businesses and travel demand. And again, as we've reported over and over this morning, there is just absolutely no evidence of anything changing on that front. So we're trying to keep our eyes on that and plan for the future accordingly.","There is just a lot of uncertainty in the world, right now things are really good for us and we just want to continue to be prepared for tough times if that is what emerges.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Tammy, you identified the number of moving pieces behind the rise in guide. I understand Love Field, I understand [inaudible] new routes like National, you know but I would also expect some reasonable tailwinds from integrating AirTran. I'm not looking for an absolute guide, but is there a particular point in 2015 where you start to normalize and you would expect your RASM trends to start moving a little bit closer to the A4A domestic average?","Tammy Romo","Well, we are going to see really the increases that we've gone through in stage length and gauge and that's going to continue here in 2015. I think that's one of the that's not going to change here in 2015. So I think really kind of getting out beyond 2015 which of course, a lot of that largely depends on what our plans are at that point in time.","But yes, we would expect our -- I think the best is to point you back to the percentage of our markets that are in development. I really think that's the key is how quickly are those going to develop. So I do think that we should see a pick up as those development markets continue to improve. So and as we said or I think we said in the past is that those are developing very rapidly and so we're actually seeing our development markets reach maturity here more recently in call it a year, historically it could take up to three years. So to your point, if we see that trend continue here in 2015, I think that's reasonable. I think there might be some pick up, but I would really attribute it to the development markets.","Jamie Baker","And Gary, a follow-up to Helane's question, particularly as it relates to the pilots. We know what the new rates are or at least they are out for ratification at American, obviously. We know what is implies in terms of the pressure on Delta's next contract. It seems to me that the longer it takes at Southwest, the potentially more expensive the contract ultimately becomes or is this a naive way for me to think about things? And obviously feel free to insult me we've known each other a long time.","Gary Kelly","Well no first of all, on your previous question by the way, I agree with you that as time goes by we ought to continue to see a better performance by the developing markets. You have a large increase in flying in late 2014. So, Tammy to me, it's late this year before we should expect to begin to see a remarkable improvement and expect maybe too strong a word there.","Well, the labor question is really it's a fair one, but the fact of the matter is it is a negotiation and the circumstances change and that can change the color of negotiations, but the main thing -- and I'll just repeat our two goals. Our two goals are to continue to reward our employees who have been very handsomely rewarded with by far the best job security in the industry for a long period of time. So that is an objective and I'm grateful that we\u2019ve an opportunity to do that.","Number two is we must keep Southwest Airlines competitive and this is now an involved environment where our legacy competitors are stronger than ever and it's more important for us than ever to maintain our low cost position and preserve our low fare brand. So that has been under attack as the other airlines have gone through bankruptcy.","I just point that out again, just to reiterate that that's as much a component of the current environment as anything else and if it takes time to get the right contract negotiated for the parties, it takes time. So we're determined to do the right thing by our people and by the company and my hope is that we can get that done this year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Tom Kim","I just wanted to ask, just going back to your Analyst Day you talked about striving for cost leadership which obviously to us is certainly the right way to approach things. I'm wondering is that implicitly suggesting that you're aiming for margin leadership? And then just along those lines of thinking, I'm wondering like how do you benchmark your financial performance versus your peers? And I guess, just given the fact that you\u2019re going to be going towards cost leadership which should imply that you're going to be hitting, topping your best pre-tax margin, the way back in the 90s this year just given where things are with fuel and pricing discipline.","So I'm wondering like how important for you is it to be the most profitable airline? And then in that vein will you be thinking, would it be looking at margin as the sort of key metric to be focusing on or would it be the pre-tax ROIC? I just would love to understand like how you're thinking about how you're really sort of comparing yourself to your peers and how important it is for you to be the margin leader in the industry? Thanks.","Gary Kelly","Well and, Tammy, you should chime in too. I think that we can achieve both and in fact, I think this is one of those industries in particular where low cost equals superior financial performance. So it is critically important that we strive to be the low cost producer. That's who we are, that's who we have been for 44 years and we cannot give up on that objective and we won't give up on that objective.","The way to measure the financial performance is return on invested capital. We do it pre-tax for various reasons. It doesn't matter whether it's pre or after and all that can be normalized, but the P&L margins can be a little bit misleading. So between carriers, between years, that was the point I was making earlier. We're in a better competitive position with lower energy cost and I'm glad that that's where we are because that helps us dramatically but it would be -- so yes, I do think it's important for us to have as a goal to have the best return on capital of all of our peers.","Tom Kim","And then if I could just switch gears and Tammy, maybe a bit more specific with regard to the strategy behind fuel hedging. I'm just wondering at what point do you think it would make sense to maybe revisit the '16 - '17 fuel hedging positions? Obviously, you took a view on '15 and certainly then very positive. I'm wondering with regard to the '16\u00a0- '17 positions, is it possible as the year progresses that you could be or we could be looking at those hedges also being unwound too? Thank you.","Tammy Romo","Yes, we\u2019ve been, just to be clear, we've been very aggressively managing our entire portfolio. So we're focused on it in the entirety and we provided the hedge percentages in the earnings release. 2016. We just have a 10% hedge position now and 2017 about 30%. So I think the numbers we reported previously were in the 40% range. And then we did have a small sliver out in 2018 and we've actually unwound that as well. So we are looking at our whole portfolio and we do that every day. So we will continue to manage that going forward.","Operator","We have time for one more question and we'll take our last question from William Greene, Morgan Stanley.","William Greene","I had a question for you Gary, on how you think about what it means to exceed the hurdle rate on ROIC, because you're nicely above it. Your goal is to be most profitable as defined by that in the industry as you mentioned, so what does that mean? So does that mean you should be revisiting your growth rate assumptions or does it mean you should target bigger payouts to shareholders or what does this actually mean now that you're exceeding it?","Gary Kelly","Well I think that you've hit on the key questions. I don't think we have anything new to report today. First of all, it's just been September since we've had this change and I'm not predicting it, but for all I know we'll be back to at $100 here in three quarters. There are some that are out there predicting that. So we just need to make sure that we have a sensible view of what the future offers, first of all. And then I think once we get comfortable with that, we can decide what we -- again high quality problem we can decide what we want to do with that excess cash.","Tammy, I don't know if you have anything that you want to add, but those would be logical considerations and right now we're not thinking that we're going to make any dramatic change to any of our plans that we've laid out for you all.","Tammy Romo","I agree, Gary. I think we need to see some consistency. It's only been a few months and so -- but we'll obviously, carefully and thoughtfully evaluate all of our options, but really nothing more to add.","Gary Kelly","And we'll do those what if scenarios too. Now the other thing I would quickly add is that yes, 2014, we are above our target. We didn't meet our target for 13 years, so this is a long term game and we do want to hit our target over a long period of time. So another answer to your question is yes, I know it was above our target and by the way we've got some catching up to do here. So we'll want to sustain these very strong returns on capital for as long as we possibly can because we've got some catching up to do.","William Greene","Let me ask you one other question. When I used to look at the industry I would often talk to you about the fact that you had referred to Southwest Airlines as a growth company and now that the industry structure has changed quite a bit and you're talking about sort of limited ability to sort of change your near term plans here and what not which is all good news, what does it mean to be a growth company? Is that still how you think of Southwest and how do you define growth, if so?","Gary Kelly","I think we're very much still a growth company. What is fun for us, Bill and again, we haven't talked in a while but we have in really a four year period of time changed the opportunity set dramatically. So we have tremendous opportunities to add destinations, add non-stop destinations within the 48 states, add frequencies within the 48 states, destinations that of course are a vast majority are outside of the 48 states. But we have tremendous opportunities to grow, but as with any company, we grow only if we bring a competitive advantage to that opportunity.","Lower fares, lower costs, better service, whatever it might be. So I think that that's a very material aspect about the way we think about our growth. So I think that we can grow. I think that we can grow every year in this kind of an environment as long as we are a low cost producer with great service and in 2010 we had kind of run out of growth opportunities. In 2015, we have a tremendous amount of growth opportunities and it's very exciting.","That doesn't mean that we're going to grow 10% a year. We won't, we're going to grow at an amount that we think is sensible for us given our balance sheet, given our free cash flow, given our relative competitive position.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Matthew and thank you again to everyone for joining us today and please feel free to call this afternoon if you have any follow-up questions. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I would like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President, Communications and Outreach.","Linda Rutherford","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Matthew. We would be happy to entertain your questions at this time, so if you would Matthew, give everyone the prompt on how they can queue up for questions we'll get started.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Terry Maxon with the Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxon","Good afternoon. I have, of course, Dallas Love Field questions. You have 153 daily departures, weekday departures there now. Do you see that increasing during 2015 with the load factors you're getting or is there room to grow at Dallas Love Field?","Gary Kelly","Well, we're at the point where we need more than 16 gates, so we do have a use agreement with United that allows us access to a 17th gate to support this level of flight activity. So hopefully, we can add some more flights, but I'm not willing to commit to that yet. So the operation we're happy with, we're real busy, load factors are where they need to be and love to be able to have more capacity at the airport obviously within the 20 gates. So we're working on that.","Terry Maxon","Your parking has been constrained at Love Field. Has that -- do you believe affected your bookings, your traffic or even though it's very tight it hasn't reduced your amount of traffic?","Gary Kelly","Terry, are you talking about customer parking?","Terry Maxon","Automobile parking, yes.","Gary Kelly","Yes, that's a rare issue. It's certainly, at peak times over the Thanksgiving holiday it was an issue, but the city said they are building a parking garage. We're in supportive of that and again that\u2019s a function of growth. We're used to that around the system and in the meantime I think parking is fine. I don't see that that's limiting us at all.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jack Nicas with the Wall Street Journal.","Jack Nicas","Some investors have speculated and feared in some cases that the windfall from cheaper fuel would lead to airlines to add capacity and lower fares. So would your potential $1.7 billion in fuel savings this year change your thinking at all on pricing going forward particularly in some of your newer and\/or more competitive markets?","Gary Kelly","That's an easy answer because I can't really tell you anything about our future pricing plans. I wouldn't want to tip off our competitors and it's also against the law, so I can't really speak to that. With respect to our capacity plans again, I think we've been very clear this morning to say that we're really not changing our business plan for 2015 with respect to those kinds of topics.","I'm sure when we get to this fall if we are convinced that we're in for a low energy prices for a while we'll revisit 2016, 2017 opportunities. But even with that, I don't think that we will want to do anything that is materially different than the plans we've already laid out. So yes, we might grow a little bit more after this year, if we are so fortunate that we end up with more cash than we had planned we'll consider the alternatives that we have to put that cash to good use.","Jack Nicas","A quick follow-up, if the U.S. and Cuba agreed to allow scheduled service between the countries again, are you interested serving Cuba?","Gary Kelly","Yes but again, we have almost 50 possible international destinations, well including Hawaii and Alaska, so not all international, but we have 50 possible destinations beyond the 48, so that will just be one more and it will have to compete for a priority for us. But it's something that obviously is intriguing and something that we'll look at, but we've got a lot of those intriguing opportunities.","Operator","We'll go next to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg.","Mary Schlangenstein","I just wanted to ask quickly was there a price or cost to unwinding your hedges and if so can you talk to us about some of the details?","Tammy Romo","Yes, I guess the answer to that is yes and we've incorporated that. We had here in the fourth quarter, we actually ended up with a $0.03 loss here in the fourth quarter per gallon, but we actually started unwinding those positions earlier in the quarter which actually minimized the loss that we took here in the fourth quarter. Our 2015, we've been participating in the majority of the market decline but yes, there was a penalty in terms of unwinding those hedges. It's probably averaging somewhere to about $0.20 for the full year and we reported to you our first quarter guidance which included about a $0.10 locked in loss, if you will and it's about $0.20 on average for the full year.","Gary Kelly","And then, Mary within that, yes there is a transaction cost depending on the technique that Tammy's group uses to trade. So that's all embedded in those numbers that she gave you.","Tammy Romo","Yes and, Mary, just to point you to in our other non-operating costs, the premiums that we pay for our protection are below the line. So the -- you can use our first quarter, I can't remember if we provided that, but that's somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range and that's probably a good indicator for what it's going to be by quarter for the rest of the year as well.","Operator","We have time for one more question and we'll take our last question from Jeffrey Dastin with Thomson Reuters.","Jeffrey Dastin","So I take it from this discussion that Southwest is not considering locking in today's low prices with new hedges?","Gary Kelly","Correct. I think it's -- and first of all, the futures prices are not today's price. So we can't get $45 in 2016 or 2017, it is much higher than that. Second, based on this dramatic collapse in just four months to five months' time, it's anybody's speculation as to what prices will be over the next 6 to 24 months and we don't speculate. So we'll look for opportunities to hedge, understanding that in an environment like this the hedging is very expensive.","So on the other hand, I think the distance between where we are and catastrophe is quite large and so I do think we'll have very nice opportunities to layer in some catastrophic protection at a reasonable cost and our folks obviously will be looking for those opportunities.","But in terms of just answering your question about locking in these prices, people were saying as prices were collapsing, well it won't go below $80 and then it won't go below $70 and then it won't go below $60 and here we are at $45, so there are those that are calling for $35 oil. So you would hate to lock in at $70 in 2017 and end up paying a really healthy penalty for that. So now is not the time for a company like Southwest to speculate.","Jeffrey Dastin","Definitely. And just to clarify, catastrophic protection would be against the upside?","Gary Kelly","Yes, sir. So this is a perfect scenario for hedging given where we were, prices decline, as Tammy reported earlier, we'll save $1.7 billion based on current prices in 2015 compared to what we spent in 2014 if I said that accurately.","Tammy Romo","You said it accurately -- and just it reminded me, going back to Mary's question, the estimated loss from the unwind of our hedge for 2015 is reflected in that $1.7 billion. So I just wanted to clarify that.","Gary Kelly","So we save a ton of money when prices fall and what we need with hedging is to prevent us from having to pay prices that put us out of business, with i.e. rising prices and that's exactly -- that hedging worked perfectly. So we protected against higher prices in 2015 and in fact ended up with significantly lower prices. So that's great.","Tammy Romo","And just to add on and based on what we've done so far in 2016 and 2017, again where prices are today, we're participating in the majority of that decline.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda Rutherford","Thanks a lot, Matthew. Of course, if any of you need further assistance you can reach one of our spokes people at 214-792-4847 or via the media website at swamedia.com. Everyone have a great afternoon.","Operator","That does conclude today's call. Thank you for joining.","Gary Kelly","Thank you, Matthew.","Operator","You're welcome, sir.

First of all, I want to start out and thank all of our people. They're working very, very hard to get us to this point, and they are justly rewarded. We had the strongest profit-sharing contribution that we've had in many years, $228 million, which was up 88% from a year ago, so just a -- just very pleased for all of our people, all of our shareholders with these numbers.","There were a number of accomplishments in 2013 and they're delineated in the press release. But I thought there's a couple that were worthy of at least highlighting for you all at the outset here this morning. First of all, it was our 41st consecutive year of profitability and, of course, that's a record that is unmatched in the airline industry and remarkable, considering how difficult the industry is and how difficult this last decade has been.","This year, we've achieved a 13.1% return on invested capital. That's pretax and a little bit short of our 15% goal. While I'm very happy with that performance, we're not satisfied until we match and then exceed this 15% return goal. It's very important to do that, of course. I would also note that, that is ahead of our weighted average cost of capital.","We were able to return significant amounts to shareholders during the year. We had share repurchases of $540 million, and that is as it relates to non-GAAP net income of $805 million, so a very substantial percentage of our earnings were returned to shareholders and also $71 million in dividends. On top of all that, we were able to reduce our long-term debt and capital lease obligations by over $300 million, just very strong free cash flow for the year.","And on the operations side, for the first time ever, in 2013, Southwest launched service beyond the 48 states with San Juan, Puerto Rico and, very importantly, got the AirTran and Southwest route networks connected. We completed the Evolve retrofit of our -700s. We converted 6 of the AirTran 737s into Southwest Airlines and began the transition of 717s to Delta Airlines.","Finally, towards the end of the year, we were successful in acquiring through a bidding process 12 slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Through that process, we also secured permanently 10 slots that we were previously leasing. And of course, we have a bid in for additional slots and gates at Washington's Reagan Airport. And then finally, a real customer service enhancement. We turned on the TSA's PreCheck expedited screening program towards the end of the year.","Turning to 2014. This is a historic year for Southwest Airlines. It is tremendously exciting. We're within days of launching international sales for Southwest service later on this year, 38 weeks to be exact to go until the Wright Amendment repeal is in effect. And of course, this is the biggest year of the physical integration of AirTran into Southwest, where we'll complete all the conversion of 737s into Southwest and complete the integration of the remaining AirTran flight crews and dispatchers into Southwest Airlines. So this time next year, the AirTran brand will be retired and it will be all Southwest.","I'm especially happy with these results considering that there's such a drag associated with integrating another airline. And to have record results, knowing that there's a lot of work and inefficiencies underlying that, again is, I think, a huge accomplishment. We have a number of aircraft that are out of service, going through conversion, which is not normal. We have multiple systems still in operation, which has a lot of inefficiencies associated with that, like multiple reservation systems. So once we get clear of all these, we'll have a lot of tailwinds, I think, and certainly looking forward to that.","Our outlook right now for the economy is very stable. Hopefully, the uncertainties that we had a year ago, hopefully, they won't return and that would be obviously a real good thing. And then fuel prices have been remarkably stable for now, 3 quarters in a row and, at least, our outlook as it stands today is for yet another quarter of stability there. So the environment to run our business is pretty darn good. We've got a lot of work to do at Southwest in 2014, but it will unveil a significant number of opportunities for us post-2014.","So with that very quick overview and, again, another thanks to all of our people for all their great results and very hard work, turn it over to Tammy Romo.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Gary, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 2013 was a year of great accomplishment, capped off with record earnings. And I would also like to congratulate all of our employees on these spectacular results.","Our full year 2013 GAAP net income was a record $754 million or $1.05 per diluted share, and x special items, our 2013 net income was a record $805 million or $1.12 per diluted share, which is a substantial increase year-over-year. Our pretax return on invested capital, excluding special items for 2013, was 13.1%, which covered our weighted average cost of capital and is a -- and is just superb progress against the little over 7% ROIC that we produced in 2012.","We ended the year strong with record fourth quarter performance. Our fourth quarter 2013 net income, excluding special items, was $236 million or $0.33 per diluted share, which exceeded First Call consensus of $0.29. Our operating income, excluding special items, was also a fourth quarter record at $418 million, which produced an operating margin of 9.4%, just is an outstanding performance.","Our fourth quarter operating revenues increased 6% year-over-year to $4.4 billion on a 2% increase in capacity. Our operating and unit revenues were both record fourth quarter performances. And our passenger revenues, unit revenues grew 4.2%, which was a little better than we expected, and that was led by an exceptional December PRASM performance, up in the 15% to 16% range. While November was negatively impacted by about 5 to 6 points from the Thanksgiving shift, December received the benefit, finishing the year strong.","We recovered nicely from the impact of the government shutdown in early October, and we ended the quarter with a combined November-December PRASM increase year-over-year in the 5% range and we are seeing similar year-over-year growth, thus far, in January. Based on our -- based on January's strong revenue trends and current bookings for the remainder of the quarter, we expect year-over-year PRASM growth, again, in first quarter. As you think about PRASM trends for the remainder of the quarter, just keep in mind, please, that the timing of Easter, which falls later this year, and also note that our year-over-year capacity comparisons become a little more difficult as the quarter progresses with March ASMs up slightly.","We are -- as Gary mentioned, our developmental markets, we're pleased with the development of our new markets. And while they did create about 0.5 point drag year-over-year on our fourth quarter PRASM results, which is what we expected, they performed much, much better in fourth quarter than in previous quarters. So they are developing very nicely. And approximately 16% of our capacity, our ASM capacity, was in some form of development.","Turning to our strategic and other initiatives, which contributed significantly to our fourth quarter and full year results. We realized approximately $400 million in net synergies for full year 2013, which is right on target with our goals. Business Select revenues for the quarter were $27 million, also a record performance, bringing our 2013 Business Select revenues to approximately $100 million. For the full year 2013, we recognized $100 million in incremental passenger revenues from our Rapid Rewards program, which was in excess of our expectations. Our Wright Amendment revenues were also terrific, contributing $75 million in fourth quarter and approximately $300 million for full year 2013. Our No Show policy, which we implemented in September, contributed $23 million in incremental revenue in the fourth quarter. And finally, our fleet monetization efforts contributed $300 million, as we expected, in 2013.","Turning to our fourth quarter freight and other revenues. We saw a decline, as we expected, largely due to the decrease in ancillary revenue from a reduction in AirTran capacity. And as our AirTran customers continue to book through southwest.com, we currently expect first quarter freight and other revenues to decline from first quarter of last year. Our EarlyBird revenues in fourth quarter were $46 million and $195 million for the year.","Taking a quick look at fuel. Our fourth quarter 2013 economic fuel price per gallon was $3.05 per gallon. The 8% decline from last year was driven by lower fuel prices and a $0.03 hedging gain for the quarter. Our fourth quarter fuel burn improved about 2.5%, 2.6%, reducing our fourth quarter fuel cost by approximately $25 million. Our hedging premiums, which were included below the line in other expenses were $22 million versus $3 million in the prior year. Based on market prices as of January 17 and our current hedge position, our first quarter 2014 economic fuel price is forecasted to be in the $3.05 to $3.10 per gallon range. Our net premium cost for first quarter is currently expected to be close to $20 million.","I'm very pleased -- just moving now to nonfuel cost. I'm very pleased with the improvement in our fourth quarter nonfuel cost performance. Overall, operating expenses declined year-over-year. And excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, our unit cost declined 0.4%, which was slightly better than we were expecting. We benefited, of course, from stable fuel prices, our fleet modernization and rigorous cost-control efforts across the company, including the cuts we made in overhead spending for the year.","Based on current trends, we expect first quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase year-over-year in the 4% range. And I'll just note that this year-over-year increase include over 1 point, probably 1 to 2 points cost impact from the January winter storm. For full year 2014, we are expecting our unit costs, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the 2% to 3% range. As we complete the AirTran integration, as Gary mentioned, we'll have further opportunities to improve operational efficiencies and G&A costs, which will continue to be a focus for us.","On the nonoperating cost side, our net interest expense was down slightly year-over-year and we expect our first quarter 2014 net interest expense to be comparable to fourth quarter. Our 2013 effective tax rate was 37.6%, and we're currently projecting our 2014 to be in that 38% range. We ended 2013 with $3.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, and our 2013 cash flow from operations was $2.5 billion. And our CapEx was $1.4 billion, as we guided, and that resulted in very strong free cash flow for the year of $1 billion.","During 2013, we returned $611 million to our shareholders through repurchasing $540 million of stock and distributing $71 million in dividends. Since August 2011, we have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We have $335 million remaining under our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization, which we intend to complete in 2014. We made $313 million of debt and capital lease payments in 2013, and our leverage, including off balance sheet aircraft leases, was 38% at year end.","Based on the current 2014 outlook and a manageable cap spending, we expect another year of healthy free cash flow. Our 2014 CapEx is currently estimated to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range. And the other item I wanted to mention regarding our cash flows is scheduled debt maturities and capital lease obligations, which are expected to be in the $550 million range in 2014 with a $350 million bullet on -- due in October. Overall, I remain very pleased with our strong financial position and balanced capital structure that supports an investment-grade rating and our focus on enhancing shareholder value.","I'll close with a quick recap of our fleet and capacity plans. We took delivery of 18 -800s and 2 pre-owned -700s during 2013. We retired 12 Classic aircraft and transitioned 13 717s to Delta. All in, we ended the year with 680 aircraft in our active fleet, which excludes additional 717s removed from active service in preparation for a transition to Delta. For 2014, we are contracted to take delivery of 33 -800s from Boeing and 12 pre-owned 700s. And we are managing a significant amount of fleet activity in 2014 with the 717 transitions, Classic retirements and AirTran -700 conversions to Southwest. However, we intend to keep our capacity for the year relatively flat on a year-over-year basis.","To conclude, I'm very pleased with our stellar 2013 financial performance and the enormous progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. I'm very thankful to our employees who worked extremely hard to deliver our 41st consecutive year of profitability and a year full of great accomplishments. 2014 will be another huge year for Southwest with the upcoming launch of international service and the repeal of the Wright Amendment. And looking into first quarter, January unit revenue trends and first quarter bookings thus far are strong and market fuel prices remain below year-ago levels.","We improved our cost performance in 2013, and we will continue our diligent efforts to control inflation in the year ahead. Our financial position remains very strong, and we are generating healthy free cash flows, allowing us to deliver on our commitment to return value to our shareholders. Our 15% pretax ROIC goal hasn't changed. We came close in 2013. And based on our current outlook, we are well positioned to hit it here in 2014.","And with that overview, Tom, we are ready to take questions","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And this will begin our question-and-answer session for analysts. [Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Gary, why do you think PRASM has been so choppy, and not just for you, but for the industry? I mean, the swing we saw from November, December was, I think, one of the biggest sequential changes in year-over-year growth rates that -- in more than 10 years and it's happened a few times over the last couple years at the industry level. So I'd love to get your perspective, given your experience in the industry and your size. What are we seeing here? Are you guys and are others still experimenting with peak-trough scheduling? Is there still a lot more room to go on that? Is it the consumer that's kind of getting squeezed out on trough periods and are concentrating their vacations around holidays? What you think is going on here?","Gary C. Kelly","Hunter, I think the primary thing going on in the fourth quarter this year are just macro issues. So coming into the fourth quarter, our demand was strong. It was consistent, unlike the first half of the year where we saw some chop. I really -- that's where I thought you were going to go with that to maybe second quarter. I think the issue in the fourth quarter was primarily the government, in that where we were constantly seeing July, August, Bob, I want to say even getting into September, we were constantly beating our forecast, and the forecast were continuing to improve. So it felt very consistent until we got into that uncertain period with the government shutdown, and then that strength sort of evaporated. It wasn't weak. It just wasn't continuing to strengthen like we've seen, really, since the end of the second quarter. That seemed to work its way out by November. And then you had -- you'd have to -- I'd have to go back and check the calendar. My recollection is this is the first time in a while where Sunday of Thanksgiving was December 1. So you just had that odd calendar thing. So that's why, I think, Tammy has been consistently trying to put the 60-day period together. It does have a little government hangover there that's not all contained in October. But December looked pretty clean, free of the -- free of all that noise from the government shutdown, benefited early on from the return traffic of Thanksgiving. It sort of shortened the window in December of the dead time in between the 2 holidays. So it's about -- well, I think it is literally short as it can be. So now last year, we saw a very strong Christmas. We saw a strong early January. I think that, that repeated itself here again this year. So going back to the second quarter -- or, rather, the third quarter and then just blowing out those 2 items, the government and the timing, I think it looked pretty consistent to us. Was it better than we expected? Yes. Can I put my finger on exactly what that was? No. We did have very strong consumer travel during that time period. I think that, that is a fact as opposed to seeing something that surprised us on the strong side with business travel. So business travel looked okay, consumer travel looked real good.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, yes. And some of your competitors this year raised their change fees and some of the domestic change fees we're seeing are really high, $200.","Gary C. Kelly","We love that.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","I know you do. So I guess that leads to my question. Are you seeing any measurable share gains from that? And I guess more broadly, more specifically I should say, what percentage of your passengers take advantage by changing their tickets now, and how has that trended over the last couple years?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, thank you. Well, yes, in the middle of the firefight, it's kind of hard to tell exactly what we might be gaining or losing, at any given point in time, to our competitors. We're working really hard, because we're so different, to make sure that our message is clear with the value that we believe we offer our customers. I do -- I said this, this morning on an interview that, yes, we love it when our competitors raise their cost to their customers. It just creates a better low-cost advantage for Southwest. So we know that customers hate fees. We know that the fees are getting higher and higher. I think that's all very good for us. And is that part of our success right now? It might be. It probably will take us a while to survey that, ask customers and look back and evaluate exactly what our shares look like. But if anything, it feels like we're gaining ground, certainly not losing ground. And, Bob, on the percentage of customers that actually make changes, do you have that top of mind?","Robert E. Jordan","Yes. It's in the 10% kind of range. And so -- maybe a little bit more than that, and it's been, historically very consistent. The other thing that we see, we -- like everybody, we conduct brand monitoring all the time, and we see that customers absolutely hate the change and bag fees and that's a consistent theme. And so it's a consistent win for us and a loser for everybody else.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on the international market startup this year, how much of your ASMs will be dedicated to international?","Gary C. Kelly","I think it's about 1%, I think. So it's very small. And the other point to reiterate right now is that, for purposes of 2014 in the way you're thinking about us, we're pretty much going to take the AirTran International route system and simply move it gradually into Southwest. That's not literally true, but at the same time, we're not anticipating any bold moves here with new international markets and a lot of additional capacity in 2014. I think this sets the stage once we get through 2014 and the final integration, get the Wright Amendment repealed, it sets the stage for us to think about doing more with international in 2015 and especially when the Houston Hobby international terminal comes online in late 2015. But what you see right now is pretty much what you should expect for 2014 in terms of that international footprint.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And just along those lines would be the capacity, x fuel CASM increase that you're looking at. How much of that is being driven by just the transitioning of the AirTran aircraft over to Southwest system and maybe some of the pilot rate increases that go with it?","Tammy Romo","Savi, this is Tammy. I think we've given you the -- when it's all said and done, the impact of the -- moving the AirTran employees to the Southwest wage scale is probably about $150 million, and of course, that's included in the synergy numbers that we provided for you. So if you're looking at our increase, our 2% to 3% increase year-over-year, that's going to drive maybe 1 point, maybe 1 point to 2 points of that increase. And we've got -- there's some other things driving that as well. If you're looking at our just airport cost, we're continuing to see some pressures in our airport cost. So that's -- you should factor that in. And then also, if you're looking specifically at our first quarter guidance, some of that's just timing of our advertising spend year-over-year. So as Gary mentioned, I think the good news here is that I think we do have some pretty meaningful opportunities to improve our cost performance as we get on the other side of the integration, just as we optimize and we're operating one network.","Gary C. Kelly","But, Savi, it feels to me like it is -- if not -- if it's not most of it, it's -- or all of it, it's certainly going to be a lot of it, and some of it's hard to tease out. We're going to have, from this point forward until we finish the integration, 10 to 15 more aircraft out of service than we normally would as one vivid example. So these are airplanes that have been pulled out of service to go through a physical conversion, either 737s into Southwest or 717s into Delta, and that is pretty inefficient. I mentioned in my opening remarks, just the ongoing inefficiency of managing 2 airlines. So there's a hangover for that. But the training cost associated with our flight crews is quite substantial. So not only do you have airplanes that have a higher number out of service, but you also have a lot of employees that are, in effect, not in revenue service. So our cost trends last year were quite good. I agree with Tammy's highlight on the airport cost. We are seeing some inflation there that we're trying to combat. But I think most of the cost pressures that we're seeing here in 2014 are attributable to the integration.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple here. Gary, just if you could go over the timing, I -- on the Houston international terminal opening up. I heard you say late 2015. What's the date there and then the timing on the res systems? I know -- I think for international, you were working on adopting the Amadeus platform, but I think for domestic, it's a separate platform or maybe Amadeus was doing the work for you. Can you update us on the timing of those initiatives?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, sir. Mike, the date for the Houston terminal has not changed, so I'm going by my memory. We may have to fine-tune this, but I believe it is fourth quarter of 2015. And be -- and I don't know if I can be more specific off the top of my head than that, but we did break ground back in September. The project is still relatively early on. It's on track so far, and I feel pretty confident that we'll be able to hit those timelines. So hopefully, early fourth quarter of 2015. On the reservation system, Amadeus, you got that right. That is our international solution. We're days away from revealing on that. So that is a multiyear, multimillion dollar technology project. It is exactly on schedule. I could not be more proud of the work that our folks have done. So that's about to be unveiled. And then the follow-on, which we -- Mike, we don't have a schedule established. We have a commitment to follow on the international with the complete replacement of the domestic reservation system. So that -- you could describe that as we are in the planning stages right now. There's a lot of work underway. We have not selected a vendor yet. And until we do, we won't have a specific project plan. But it's going to take us well beyond 2014 and maybe all the way through 2015. So it's just a little premature to give you a timetable on that. With respect to us making any decision on that, that should be in the first half of this year easily. So our focus, as you can tell, is to get international up and running first. That will pave the way to then move directly into the complete replacement of that system.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just the second on the Wright. The Wright revenue, $300 million, it would seem reasonable to assume that a lot of that is -- it's a less attractive itinerary for a business traveler, given that a lot of those city pairs that are in that $300 million bucket our on a one-stop, maybe on a 2-stop basis. So as you get to that point where you can roll nonstop service in some of those markets, what's the potential upside here and -- or maybe how you think about it? And, Gary, maybe your experience when you launched service to Kansas City and St. Louis. Although I realize that prior to that, you didn't have the Wright to offer those markets on a one-stop basis, so maybe the uptick was much more significant. I mean, but this -- how should we think about it? How are you thinking about it? What's the potential ramp-up here? It seems like a huge opportunity.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I guess all of us have to define huge. Yes, we are very excited about it. And I agree with you, Mike. Everything is set. I think it is a huge opportunity. I'm not really ready to give you a number today on exactly what that would be, but you can -- I can guarantee we are going to add new itineraries and new flights once the repeal is in effect on October 13. And I agree with you. I think that just by virtue of the fact that we're doing so well on -- in fairness to your question, it's essentially customers flying us on a one-stop basis. I doubt that there's very many 2-stop customers out there. But yes, there's a bunch of people flying us already, and that is traditional Southwest expansion techniques. We look for one-stop customers where we see significant demand in an O&D market. That is where we go put point-to-point nonstop service in. So we've got the roadmap. We know where the customers are. I think we -- I think it's a terrific opportunity.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, just a housekeeping item for Tammy. Does the 2% to 3% x fuel CASM guidance for the full year include any labor accruals? Or should we assume that if any labor announcements do occur later this year, that they would potentially further pressure this metric? Also capacity by quarter, if I missed that from earlier in the call.","Tammy Romo","Jamie, yes, the 2% to 3% is based on our current -- our contracts, our current contracts with labor. So no, it does not include any accruals. On our capacity, yes, I just mentioned during my remarks that we expect our capacity -- maintain capacity relatively flat in that guidance. That's our intention pretty much throughout the year for -- we've got our schedule published out through June. And our first quarter will be, again, roughly flat, [indiscernible] maybe a little bit, and our second quarter ASMs, also down slightly.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then for Gary, as we think about the airline business models in the U.S., the industry seems to be bifurcating into traditional legacies on one side and ultra-low-cost carriers on the other side. And then you have the handful of airlines that are trying to sort of bridge the middle. And I would certainly put JetBlue into that category and I think, increasingly, Southwest. And at the same time, obviously, both operating extremes are far more profitable today than they've been in the past. So it just isn't clear to me if this means you'll be competitively left alone or competitively seized upon from both sides potentially? And you and I haven't necessarily agreed in the past as to what sort of industry health presents the most opportunity for Southwest. You said there'd be opportunity for growth earlier in your comments. But I can't help but wonder whether this potential identity crisis, trying to straddle the middle, does this work against you as your model isn't quite as easy to define as it was in the '90s? Any thoughts on this?","Gary C. Kelly","Sure. The -- I don't see that there's an identity crisis at all. I would certainly concede that the world is very different today than it was at the beginning of the last decade. So the difference between just the cost structure that we have to the legacy carriers has narrowed. I think it remains to be seen whether that will widen again. What we can do is control what we do at Southwest Airlines, of course, and we are devoted to being the low-cost producer in the industry. We're attacking very close to the ultra-low-cost carriers, as they are called. So we're not significantly higher than they are and, certainly, have a much wider cost advantage relative to the legacy carriers in Southwest than the ultra-low-cost carriers have as compared to Southwest. So we're going to attack to low cost, and we'll continue to make enhancements to the customer experience that we think make sense through that filter. We're still very different, as you know. We're very different than the ultra-low-cost, and we're very different than the legacy carriers. And again, customers vote, and they vote for Southwest. So I think it'll continue to be a very successful model, particularly if we control our cost and live up to that low-cost producer mantle. The fact that we have the best compensation in the industry and are still among the lowest-cost producers is pretty remarkable, and we haven't hit our stride yet on our cost. So the fleet modernization is paying huge dividends on the cost. And we have this -- as everybody understands, we've got a lot of inefficiencies baked in right now because of this integration that'll be behind us once we clear 2014. So that's the way we see ourselves, and that doesn't mean that we can't adjust in the future. But there are no plans to deviate from who we are, which is America's leading low-fare airline.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just want to ask you about slots. Does winning slots at LaGuardia make you less likely to win additional slots at DCA? And why is DCA a good thing for Southwest, given your presence at BWI? And then lastly, if you do win, would it impact your growth guidance for this year?","Gary C. Kelly","Okay. So you just give us a course correction if we don't hit all your points here, Duane. But the -- I think the first answer is no. There's no issue with the fact that we got what amounted to 6 trips a day at LaGuardia. So I'm very hopeful that we'll get some additional slots here at Reagan. The Reagan opportunity is pretty straightforward. It is among the most constrained airports in terms of supply versus demand. We have a lot of customers that love Southwest Airlines. We serve more people in the United States than anybody else by far, and they want to -- a lot of them want to go to Reagan. So we're finding that it is a very nice complement to the service that we provide to BWI. Reagan, in terms of its daily operations for Southwest, will never rival BWI. There's enough distance between the 2 airports where we can make it work, and there's a fair amount of connecting and flow traffic also that goes through BWI that I would not expect at Reagan. So we do the same thing in the Boston area. We do the same thing in the Bay Area. We do the same thing in Southern California. So in some places that works well, and geography and distance and traffic and other things have a lot to do with that. I don't think that would make sense for Dallas, Houston or Chicago but it certainly has proved to make good sense for us in the Baltimore-Washington area. I forgot your last question.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, just -- if you won a big block there, would it impact your growth guidance this year? And then when do you expect an answer?","Gary C. Kelly","I think, and Mike is here with me, our fleet plans are pretty set here for 2014. I don't see us bringing in, other than sort of sliding on the calendar near year end, I don't see any change from what Tammy reported, which is 33 firm from Boeing, I don't see that changing; and then 12 on the used market, I don't see that changing. Now we have not decided on our fleet plan yet for 2015. So I think that's still \u2013 as I think all of you all understand that that's something that we'll make up our minds with as we go through 2014. The only variable here is whether we retire any airplanes faster. And of course, we've got a plan for the year. And if the year goes well, we wouldn't want to do that. If we get the slots, we'll have to take aircraft capacity from somewhere, depending upon what we get and when we have to fly it. So it's a small enough amount of capacity that I just don't think it's going to be difficult for us to do that. But no, we don't have any plans to change our fleet for 2014.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Gary, a question on pricing. Just given where load factors are and expected relatively flat capacity, should we see pricing momentum improve with the economy, or to what extent do you feel like leisure passengers are beginning to feel little bit of fare hike fatigue?","Gary C. Kelly","Understanding that I can't really comment on pricing strategy going forward, we want to be the low-fare airline. That is dependent upon us continuing to be among the low-cost producers, if not the low-cost producer. So those are always factors. It also obviously is impacted by cost and with fuel being foremost in our minds. So I think all of those are factoring in. It's very difficult to price one's way out of a recession, as we all know. It does feel like the economy is improving. So hopefully, that means the revenue environment is improving. If demand improves, then it puts all of us in a position where we can manage our revenues and costs better. But beyond that, I can't really tell you what our specific plans are. Bob, I think it's true, if you look back in the mirror for the last 12 months, our fare increases have been very modest, very infrequent and very judicious. So I think that's also helpful in thinking about what happens next. But otherwise, I can't tell you what our plans are.","Robert E. Jordan","Yes. I would just add that there are always 2 components, there's prices and then inventory management throughout the price structure. And I think we worked hard, as we've talked about, to get better and better every year at the way we revenue manage and inventory manage, and that continues in 2014 as we bring some new techniques online. But yes, we've been extremely modest in our price increases, looking back into 2013, and that's the plan continuing as well.","Gary C. Kelly","And so just, again, to recap, our -- we're not sitting here hoping that we can raise fares. We're sitting here hoping that we can maintain our position as the low-fare leader in the country and bring more competition in a shrinking industry.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And, Tammy, if I could ask a separate question. Just given where your leverage ratios are and strong free cash flow generation expected again this year, do you see scope to be a bit more aggressive on buybacks and dividends?","Tammy Romo","We're not going to comment specifically on that question, other than to say we do have what -- we intend to complete our current repurchase program. So we'll get that completed in 2014. And beyond that, just not ready to comment on that today.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can I just ask a follow-on question? Is there an upper end of the leverage ratio that you're comfortable with?","Tammy Romo","Historically, we've -- we feel pretty comfortable around that 40% mark, and if -- I think that's a good point for us to manage to. It might go up and down, but I think 40% is a pretty good target for us.","Gary C. Kelly","And I would just add on that -- and Tammy mentioned this in her remarks, but maintaining our investment-grade credit rating is very important to us. And while the rating agencies aren't so focused on leverage, it's more coverage ratios, obviously, they all work together. So I think we'll definitely want to manage our balance sheet in a conservative way so that we can -- not just keep the current rating, but improve it and, certainly, maintain that investment-grade rating.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Gary, and maybe a bit for Bob, obviously, there's been a quite a bit of reallocation of flying within the network, particularly with some of the fleet initiatives, particularly as we start to get towards that 15% pretax rate target. How should we think about kind of where the network's at in terms of where aircraft are deployed? Is there a lot -- is there a fair amount more change to come, or do you feel like you're kind of getting airplanes in the right places now?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, just to recap what we've said so far. At least in recent times, the percentage of our route system that is \"under development\" is a very high. So I think we shared that it's 16% of our available seat miles. That is going to be sustained throughout this year. And then when we have the final retirement of AirTran and integration into Southwest, it'll actually step up. So you're going to see a lot of \"optimization\" taking place certainly this year. And then next year, we'll have a lot of opportunities that unfold, and Bob will have a lot of choices to make about where we might want to add new routes. But I think we're still in pretty heavy optimization mode, wouldn't you say, Bob?","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, I think I would say to 2014, obviously, it's a big year. We have the completion of the integration, which means we're going to continue to move Atlanta from a still somewhat hub structure, much less with the November schedule change, to a more traditional Southwest structure. I don't think that'll have a big impact on capacity in Atlanta, but it'll have an impact -- continuing impact on the flight schedule there. Of course, you've got the additions of Love Field coming in 2015. Obviously, Houston. So I think those are really the drivers of a change in the network. In a typical year, without integration and big capacity choices like Dallas, the amount of the network under significant change would be really sub-5%. So I think that's pretty typical, and we'll see that after we see some of these. But we're constantly optimizing at a flight level, moving flight timings and market timings and then moving flights from markets that just don't make sense from an ROIC perspective to markets that do. So that'll continue, as Gary said.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, and if I can just add one more quick point. One of the things that we -- and Bob and I totally agree on this, that we want to do, prospectively, is not churn the entire network as much. So in other words, if there's 25% of our route system that needs work, what we've been doing is re-racking 100% of it. And therefore, in a stable market, I mean you pick it, let's say Dallas-Houston, Dallas-Austin, whatever, the flight times move around and customers don't like that and neither do our employees. So we would like, to the extent that we can, to stabilize the route network going forward, understanding that there's still a lot of optimization to be done on the minority of the route system. That's easier said than done, as you well know, because it is in network and everything is all connected together. But we do have a desire to begin to stabilize the network. The only thing that argues against that is we are all forced -- this is a question earlier. We're forced to deal with seasonality and peaks and valleys a lot more today than when fuel prices were $20 a barrel. So it's just with the understanding that some of our cities may see a very significant change in their flight activity, depending on where they are in the off season. So that's relatively new for Southwest. We weren't doing that kind of thing a decade ago, but it is a fact of life today and a necessity. So good question, and it's something that, I think, we're continuing to try to perfect.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, that's very helpful. Just maybe a quick one, just in terms of the January RASM. Obviously, I mean, Tammy, you mentioned sort of a storm impact on the CASM side. Was it prolonged enough of an impact that you lost revenue? Or is that -- or was there a RASM bump in there from the weather?","Tammy Romo","Yes. There was a RASM bump due to weather. But if you're just looking at revenues, we were able to recapture most of that revenue. So it wasn't a material impact.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, as we continue to see ROIC improve and as we, at least, by my model, project out you hitting your target at some point in the future, I was hoping that you could offer a framework for thinking about capacity growth as we think about 2015 and '16. I'm not trying to lock you into any guidance, but just trying to understand, I mean, should we be thinking sub-GDP capacity growth, mid-single digits? In broad strokes, what can you tell us?","Gary C. Kelly","I think it's premature to provide that kind of guidance yet. First of all, I think we need to decide what we want to do and then I think that, that will help fine-tune that logic. I think it makes sense for us to walk before we run, and we want to sustain returns on invested capital that are sufficient to support that growth. So I think before we go off and take a whole lot of risk here, we want to make sure that any new flights that we add, we want to make sure that it still allows us to achieve our return criteria. It may almost be better to think about it in terms of units or numbers of airplanes. We'd love to grow the fleet next year. But I think relative to the base in our fleet, right now, we have 680 airplanes that are in service, if you will, or available for schedule, and we're not looking at a 10% increase in our fleet growth or anything like that. So tying it to GDP is a little bit too mechanical. We don't -- we live within the GDP and obviously have macro effects, but I don't see that we're going to be growing double the GDP rate or triple the GDP rate or anything like that. So again, I think all this is a little premature. One thing to point out with our capacity in 2015 is that we're going to have capacity growth next year, simply because you'll have a much higher percentage of aircraft out of nonproductive status. So even without adding any airplanes next year, we'll be able to add some capacity. And we'll have to factor that in to whatever choices that we want to make for next year.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you help us kind of quantify what that percentage could be, even without fleet growth?","Gary C. Kelly","Probably not yet. I don't think we're ready to do that, right. It would be relatively modest. But I don't think we're ready to commit even to that because we have some flexibility as to how many airplanes we want to retire. So I think all of those would be premature at this stage. Said a different way, we just don't -- we don't have our plans set for 2015. And until we do that, I don't think I can give you any better guidance.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And if I could ask a cost-related question. Tammy, just in terms of the labor negotiations out there, I mean, given that you're currently, though of course trends have improved, currently still below your return target. It seems difficult to be able to sign a contract that doesn't put your return target at risk, simply because you're not there yet. Does that kind of suggest that perhaps it might still take some time before we see a contract? And sort of in that vein, would we need to hit our return target before we see a lot of these contracts kind of actually get negotiated?","Tammy Romo","Our goal on our cost, as we've discussed, we've got a 2% to 3% increase next year. We're obviously not happy with that. And with respect to our labor contracts, really, what we're trying to do across-the-board is just squeeze out ways and be just as efficient as we possibly can. So with respect to our labor contracts, I think a goal would be more cost neutral. And so that, ultimately, as we get on the other side of the AirTran integration, overall goal is to stabilize our cost performance. With respect to labor, we've got -- Mike, is there anything you want to chime in on the labor side?","Michael G. Van De Ven","Yes. We're actively working with all of our labor groups that are in Section 6, and we want to contract with them. So we're not trying to slow play that at all. We have a lot of opportunities. Our labor contracts are built on operating models that existed in Southwest Airlines 10 and 15 years ago. So there are a lot of avenues in that labor contract where I think that we can find flexibility and ways that we can improve our operating performance and improve our cost and come to a contract with our labor groups that doesn't put unit cost pressure on the company.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, and I would just add on. In other words, the implication of your question is that whatever we do is going to increase the cost to the company, and that's not the way we're thinking about it at all. And it's not -- you might quibble with this a little bit, but it's not necessarily tied to the 15% return requirement. The issue with our cost structure is much more strategic because we want to continue to be the low-cost producer in the industry and have job security and prosperity for our employees over a long period of time. And it is much more important for us to work hard together to retain that competitive advantage as opposed to making sure that, that fits into a near-term 15% return requirement. We want to be a low-cost producer. We want to be America's low-fare airline, and we want to take our low fares to North America. And the only way we can do that is to make sure that we are, in fact, low cost. What Mike was pointing out is there are -- we can do very good things for our employees and, at the same time, eliminate waste and eliminate inefficiencies that currently exist. And it's just a wonderful place to be. We have wonderful opportunities to win on both counts and keep Southwest Airlines jobs secure and a low-cost producer. That's our...","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question with respect to the 717s. I noticed that Delta announced that some of them are going to be flying right back at Love Field, just in a different livery. And I'm just -- what's the thought there? Given their competitive capacity, how does that impact your own operations there?","Gary C. Kelly","I think it's irrelevant. There are plenty of airplanes available in the world. And when we struck the deal with Delta, they were either going to get airplanes for us or get airplanes from brand X. So they will make their own decisions about how many airplanes they want, where they want to fly them. So it really has nothing to do with us. And likewise, we'll have the same number of airplanes with or without the 717 deal that we did. So the other thing I would point out is that the city of Dallas has not awarded the gates, much less the flying that is -- that you're speaking about. So the DOJ has required that American divest 2 gates, and it remains to be seen who will get those 2 gates.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I know you guys had applied to get them as well, didn't you?","Gary C. Kelly","I don't think I'm speaking out of school here, but there is no process underway yet for the divestiture of those 2 gates. So I assume when that happens, that will be public and there'll be an auction or a bidding -- again, we -- I don't know exactly how that's going to take place. I do know that it has not taken place. What is currently being focused on, of course, is the Reagan gates and slots that have been bid upon. And so that's the only thing that is in play right now.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just on the cost guidance for the full year, does that include the impact of the runway closings at San Francisco?","Tammy Romo","Yes, it does.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I guess either, Tammy, I guess, or Gary, I wonder if you can help peel back the onion on CapEx this year. Specifically, how does non-aircraft CapEx in '14 compare to '13? And with respect to the aircraft CapEx, what percent of the planes would you consider financing, or are you going to pay cash? And then thirdly, tying that to liquidity, now that we're in an economic recovery that seems well underway, does the level of liquidity that is needed to run the airline change?","Tammy Romo","Yes. Dan, sure, I can give you a little more color on the CapEx. We have -- our non -- our aircraft CapEx for 2014 is $1.1 billion, that -- out of the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. And of course, the rest of that represents investments. We've got elevated levels of technology spend related to our projects, the implementation of our international reservation system. So but the aircraft portion is $1.1 billion. So in terms of the liquidity, we feel -- we obviously have ample liquidity. I think we could manage our cash position down, certainly from the levels that we're at today. And so somewhere in that $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, I think, in terms of cash and short-term investments, I think we feel real comfortable at those levels. We haven't laid out our plans for how much of those would be financed or not. Obviously, with the very healthy cash flows that we're generating, we have some options there. So we don't necessarily need to do any financing to pay for those. That's obviously a choice that we have ahead of us.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Understood. And then if I could peel back the onion a little bit on corporate travel, simply because there's a lot of noise in the fourth quarter given the government shutdown and a lot of noise in the first -- in January, at least, so far, given the weather-related cancellations. How do we think about that trend in the fourth quarter heading into the first quarter based on what you're seeing so far?","Tammy Romo","Actually, our corporate sales for the fourth quarter increased very nicely. We had a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter. Our business traffic, just overall, I would characterize that as stable. And I don't see any reason for that to change here in the first quarter. With the improved economy, hopefully, we'll see some pickup there. But we've been encouraged by the trends that we've seen so far.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, again for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President, Communications and Strategic Outreach.","Linda B. Rutherford","Hello, everyone. Tom, if you could give the folks some instructions to queue up, and we will be able to take your questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Terry Maxon with the Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxon","You've got 120 to 130 flights today at Love Field, about I think. How many flights should we expect once the Wright Amendment goes away in October?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, we're chuckling. More. I think we'll probably ask you to stay tuned on that one, more to come.","Terry Maxon","Well, the -- can you give us some idea of the -- or the timetable for when you're going to announce that? Because you're right in that window where you typically would extend your schedule. I presume, perhaps, the international announcements are tied up in that as well.","Gary C. Kelly","So I guess I'm just going to have to repeat that, yes, we are getting closer and not ready to reveal a date or what our plans are just quite yet.","Terry Maxon","All right. And if you wouldn't mind restating your plans for international. I took it from your comments to the analysts that as Southwest takes over, we shouldn't expect more international service from the Southwest umbrella in 2014. We would likely see any expansion starting in 2015?","Gary C. Kelly","Correct. And that's as we see it today, understanding that the world is somewhat dynamic. Of course, the new things that have emerged for 2014 are the additional slots at LaGuardia and, hopefully, at Washington \u2013 or at Reagan. So we'll have to manage those. The current plan is to essentially take the AirTran international footprint and gradually move it over to Southwest. And on that announcement, yes, sir, we are days away from revealing what our international plans are. So we would like to expand our international flying in 2015. That's premature yet to make that commitment. Obviously, we are building 5 gates in Houston with the express intent of adding flights there. So if we're going to -- we need to follow through and add flights, at least, in late 2015. What we might do before that, again, we just haven't made a decision yet. But we'll have ample opportunities to add international flying as we go forward. So I'm very excited about that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Koenig with the Associated Press.","David Koenig","Gary, you and Bob addressed fares in the analyst part of the call. But I wondered if you could explain a little bit more about what's behind the increase in the average fare. It looks like some of that could be due to longer average stage lengths, but not all of it. With demand pretty strong, are you just selling fewer seats at Wanna Get Away prices? And also, what percentage of seats are you selling at full fare? Is that going up?","Gary C. Kelly","The main thing going on there, David, is just what you said. It is that we're flying longer distances. The mix changes constantly, in terms of how people are buying seats on sale versus not. So that is -- it is a fact that there were fewer sale seats sold in 2014, at least in the fourth quarter, Bob. So that -- the mix strengthened. My recollection, Tammy, is that the full fare traffic was roughly flat year-over-year. So it didn't change. I don't know if you all released that statistic or not. But you're right, David, that's some of it. But the primary driver is that the distances are longer, and that's what's driving the largest percentage of the fares up.","Robert E. Jordan","David, yes, that's exactly right. The other benefits you have in there is we are constantly working on our revenue management technique. So we have some improvements to our forecaster, have some fare restructuring, so not increasing and changing prices but just restructuring the way we look at inventory. So we've had a contribution -- a pretty significant contribution from our revenue management techniques in 2013 as well.","Gary C. Kelly","The other thing happening, of course, is the literal transition from AirTran to Southwest. And Southwest does not charge fees and they do, and their fares are just different. So that has an impact on the average fare as well.","David Koenig","Anything on the percentage of full fare?","Gary C. Kelly","Do you have a first -- do you have a full fare percentage, Tammy, that you released, that's published.","Tammy Romo","I sure do. For fourth quarter '13, it was hovering right around 20%.","David Koenig","I'm sorry, what should we compare that to? So what was that, in the year-ago quarter or even the previous quarter?","Gary C. Kelly","So that's from the fourth quarter.","Tammy Romo","It wasn't -- yes, it wasn't significantly different.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jack Nicas with the Wall Street Journal.","Jack Nicas","So labor cost increased by 6% or nearly $300 million in 2013. How much of that was AirTran employees coming over to Southwest pay scale? Can you give us a little more color on that?","Gary C. Kelly","And most of it was profit-sharing, I think, by the way, but...","Tammy Romo","Yes, that's right. Probably -- if I had to, it's probably about half of our -- as I mentioned in the analyst call, that the total impact of bringing the AirTran employees over to Southwest is about $150 million. And it was probably about half of that, I would say, that came over this year.","Jack Nicas","Okay, great. If I could have one more quick follow-up question. As you lose the AirTran brand in 2014, obviously, that means losing the bag fees from the full Southwest system. Is there any estimate on the potential lost revenue from losing AirTran's bag fees in 2014?","Gary C. Kelly","We're expecting our unit revenues for 2014 to be better. That's our plan, at least, to be better than 2013, understanding that we will be rapidly losing bag fees from AirTran. We've already been losing bag fees from AirTran, and we're fine with that. So it's all factored in to our revenue guidance. I don't recall off the top of my head what the bag fee revenue was in the fourth quarter. It was tens of millions of dollars. But perhaps...","Tammy Romo","Yes, for the -- I do. For the AirTran -- I have the AirTran bag fees. Those were about $16 million for the fourth quarter. And for the...","Gary C. Kelly","So $60 million (sic) [$16 million] annual revenue stream that will not be in place in 2015, and we'll cover it through other means. So that was -- again, that was anticipated when we acquired AirTran back in 2011, and that's -- we're generating $400 million more earnings as a consequence of buying AirTran, even with these bags fees gradually going away. So we have a -- we don't need the bag fees and don't want them. So we have -- we do -- we just -- we can't unravel what AirTran does until it completely is retired and comes over to Southwest.","Robert E. Jordan","And obviously, as they move to Southwest, they participate in EarlyBird, upgraded boarding, Business Select, a lot of ancillary revenue production that we have on the Southwest side as well.","Gary C. Kelly","And just a stronger overall brand. So it's just an interesting contrast between 2 businesses and how different they can be. And of course, it's hard to find an airline that's more different than Southwest, and we think our differences are good.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles","Gary, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the labor situation. I know that you gave some guidance that your costs -- your unit costs going up, but you didn't include any anticipation in contract changes. Can you talk a little bit about the labor picture and if there's a particular group that you might be focusing on and trying to get their amendable contracts taken care of this year?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, we're -- again, this is -- there's nothing unusual about our situation with our contracts. We're always negotiating contracts, and we're giving equal emphasis and attention to each one of them. So I don't think we're trying to get one done versus the other at all. We are trying to be fair and consistent amongst all of our employees. So it is actually helpful to be talking with them simultaneously, and that -- because circumstances change over time and their needs change, our needs change. So actually, having them altogether is very helpful in that regard. But our folks -- the main thing is our people are terrific. They do a wonderful job, they're very hardworking, they have Southwest Airlines on top. I'm delighted that they are so well rewarded with the great results this year with a near doubling of the profit sharing. It'll be over 6% of their compensation. They're -- most of them are stockholders and have seen a very nice appreciation in their Southwest stock and a very handsome increase in the dividend. So there's more that we can do, and we're -- Mike Van de Ven said earlier that we're anxious to get contracts, get updated contracts with our employees because there's things that we want to do differently and there's things that we can do for our people. In the meantime, as you know, are all of our employees have contacts and they continue until they're ultimately amended, and we're working hard to get that done.","Andrea Ahles","So what are some of the things that you want to do differently?","Gary C. Kelly","Mike mentioned it. It's more flexibility. Our world has changed since the 1970s. Then we had the same schedule, every day, every month, year in, year out. Now we have significant variability from the season, from day of week. One of our days that needs the most attention, for example, is Tuesday. So there's any variety of things that we could address to give our people a lot better resources, time to when they -- when the needs exist with our customers, so that's the primary thing. And I think, again, there's opportunities with those kinds of efficiency gains. There's opportunity to do good things for our people.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dawn Gilbertson with the Arizona Republic.","Dawn Gilbertson","Gary, I have a couple of quick questions. I'm a little unclear on the announcement on international flights that's days away. How much that play out in a city like Phoenix? You said we're not going to see any new destinations. Right now, we have a mix of some of the AirTran cities we can get to on you guys or a combination of both and some we can't. So how might that change in Phoenix? And my other question has to do with Hawaii, if you have any updates on Hawaii.","Gary C. Kelly","I think it's -- and I don't want to speculate right now, but Phoenix doesn't have any AirTran international service today. So obviously, once we convert all the international flying into Southwest, then Phoenix would be eligible for Southwest to consider launching nonstop international service. So that...","Dawn Gilbertson","So it's nonstop, which could be different.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, ma'am. So you could have flights to Mexico, as an example, ultimately, on Southwest out of Phoenix. I'm not predicting whether that will happen or when it might happen. I'm simply saying that once we do that, it very well -- well, it could happen. And that's something that Bob Jordan and his team will look at very carefully.","Dawn Gilbertson","So what will be announced -- I guess then what will be announced in the next 2 days? I mean, what will that release look like? I mean, will it say -- I guess I'm a little unclear on what exactly you will be announcing that day. Will it be routes or...","Gary C. Kelly","It will be -- yes, it'll be routes, it'll be flights, it will be seats for sale, prices, the whole bit. So it is -- as a general image, all we've said is that we're simply going to take the current AirTran international route system and move it into Southwest. You just can't take that literally. So it will be -- whatever we do will be a little different than what AirTran is currently doing. And so -- and I don't -- I'm not ready to reveal yet how Phoenix might fit into even that, because the Southwest network, Phoenix could very well have international itineraries even though it's not on a nonstop basis over the Southwest network. So that is all to -- again, to be revealed. And then, of course, we're just getting started here in 2014, so it is our hope and desire that we're going to grow it from here.","Dawn Gilbertson","Okay. And then Hawaii?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I've heard of Hawaii. It sounds really exciting. And one day...","Dawn Gilbertson","You guys had been talking about it.","Gary C. Kelly","One day, Southwest might fly there. Well, the only thing that we've said on is that we are investing in Southwest's capabilities so that we will have the option of flying to Hawaii at some point. Whereas if you look at the -- in the rearview mirror and in prior years, Southwest really didn't have the capability. So you need additional technology, you need additional equipment. And those investments have largely been made. It's somewhat analogous to this whole international discussion that, in 2000, Southwest couldn't fly international. We also couldn't fly to Hawaii. Now we'll have those capabilities in place. We have a wealth of growth opportunities to choose from, and we'll be very circumspect, of course, as to which ones we're most seriously considering at any given point in time. If we could have created all of the Hawaiian flying capabilities and kept that a secret, we would have. It's just impossible to do because it just plays out with so many people and it's so high profile. But that's why you've heard about it, otherwise, you wouldn't know what we were up to, and that's the way we like it.","Dawn Gilbertson","If I can just ask one more quick one on the fee front. Last year, you did the No Show policy. You upped the EarlyBird fee, I believe that was in 2013. What can travelers expect, if anything, this year in terms of new fees, or -- I don't suppose you're going to announce you're going to increase any fees, but what's you're thinking this year on that front?","Gary C. Kelly","There's absolutely no change in our bag fees in terms of charging for the first or second bag. There's absolutely no change in our change fees in that we don't charge them. So I think that's pretty much what customers can expect is bags fly free, and I'm delighted with what Bob and our marketing team accomplished here recently. They've also extended the onboard television for free for another year. So we love the word free at Southwest.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we have time for one final question. It comes from Richard Velotta with the Las Vegas Sun.","Richard Velotta","I'm kind of piggybacking -- I'm going to piggyback on Dawn's question and just substitute Las Vegas for Phoenix. I know we've had some discussions, me and Mr. Jordan had spoken about a possibility of international from Las Vegas with our international emphasis here. Any change or any updates that I can report regarding the -- anything new with international with Southwest in Las Vegas?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, again, we can just lift -- the answer is the exact same. But Phoenix is very important to Southwest. Las Vegas is very important to Southwest. We'll reveal what the itineraries are soon, and then everybody can see how they fit in, in the meantime. But in terms of the specifics as to whether or when we'll have nonstops out of Vegas, again, I can't speak to that today.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing comments.","Linda B.

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","Joining the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tom Nealon, President; Mike Van De Ven, Chief Operating Officer; and other members of senior management.","Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements.

Please go ahead, sir.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2017 conference call. I am very pleased to report another very strong quarter. Record EPS and that is despite higher labor contract costs since 2016 and also somewhat higher fuel prices. We had strong cash flow. We completed our 2016 share repurchase authorization. I was also pleased to see growth in average fares for the first time in about two years. And despite some drag from our reservation system conversion, we had a solid unit revenue performance of increase of 1.5%, which was right in line with our expectations.","Without the res system conversion, it would have been closer to a 2.5% growth on 5.1% capacity growth, a very solid revenue performance with corrective actions planned before year-end on some of our res system issues. Our third quarter outlook is in line with second quarter, the year-ago comps, taking those into consideration. The new reservation system penalty is a little bit more in the third quarter, the July 4, holiday timing softens the third quarter performance. And the sequential comp second quarter is harder with the full Easter benefit showing up in the second quarter. Net all that out and up 1% year-over-year is what we would expect, what you all should expect, relative to the trends from the second quarter.","Our cost forecast for the year is higher than we last reported. I'm not real happy about that. We're certainly not satisfied with that. We'll be working hard during the second half of this year to rein it back into our original 2017 plan. I was very pleased with the second quarter cost performance and can at least confirm that trend-wise we'll see our unit costs pressure year-over-year begin to ease here in the third quarter and then again in the fourth quarter. Tammy will explain further, but I did want to offer some commentary on our capacity forecast. It's being updated today for the full year 2017.","We have a large number of airplane deliveries scheduled for this year. If you will note in the press release, it's 71. 18 of those are pre-owned airplanes. They go through an extensive conversion process to match the Southwest livery and convert to our maintenance configuration. So we conservatively planned for the completion of that prior to committing those airplanes into revenue service. And our tech ops folks are doing a fantastic job. And what we're finding here in 2017 is the aircraft are being delivered earlier than we had planned.","We have put those early deliveries into revenue service this year, in essence, as a spare. And that's driven our cancellations down, and therefore, our ASM production higher, all compared to our forecast. And that's all as compared to a 3.5% annual forecast. So knowing that for the second half of the year, we've updated our forecast. And we've also decided to implement some scheduled flying with some of this available aircraft soon. And that will be for flying beginning in the fourth quarter. We expect the incremental capacity to be profit-accretive, of course, or we wouldn't do it.","The fourth quarter will still result in very modest year-over-year capacity growth somewhere in the 1% to 2% range. And as of now, we aren't expecting any change to the rough 2018 estimates that we provided last quarter and then updated today. The highlight for this year and for this quarter was our new reservation system. I am very proud of our people, the job that they did in designing and building and testing and deploying this new technology. It was literally a flawless deployment. We discovered some design issues, if you will. And as I said, I expect those to be remedied quickly.","Next, I'm my very proud of all the front-line employees along with all of our training folks, they worked exceptionally hard to learn and use a totally-new system. It has been very hard work, but they have made it look easy to our customers. So again, my hat is off to them. So aside from what I would describe as normal break-in issues that one would expect from a system effort that's this massive, it is all we expected it to be. We'll work hard to hit our $200 million run rate of incremental annual revenues by the end of next year. And that does not include fixing the problems that we discussed that affect the second and third quarter.","We achieved another important second quarter milestone with the completion of the new international concourse at Fort Lauderdale, and then the launch of the new international flights from Fort Lauderdale. And that included a new destination on our route network, which was Grand Cayman. We opened Cincinnati in the quarter to a very warm welcome from the community. We're off to a great start there.","And we are in the final lap this quarter preparing for the launch of the 737 MAX 8 on October 1 along with the retirement of our Classic fleets \u2013 or fleet, rather, in late September. So I do want to thank all our people again for a very strong performance, congratulate them on a superb quarter that earned them profit sharing of $202 million.","And with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tammy Romo, to take us through the quarterly financials.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Hi. Thanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. Our employees did a great job again this quarter providing their legendary customer service. And I'd like to thank them for that and congratulate them on a great quarter. Our second quarter profits were a strong $746 million and excluding special items, $748 million. And our earnings per share, excluding special items was a record performance.","Margins were very healthy and our operating margin exceeded 21%. Our balance sheet, cash flows and liquidity remained strong, and I am delighted with our recent upgrade to A3 by Moody's. We're committed to our investment-grade ratings and as always, the prudent management of our capital structure.","Overall, I'm very pleased with the second quarter and would like to congratulate our employees on the $202 million in profit sharing. On the revenue side, our second quarter passenger and operating revenues hit an all-time quarterly high. Our unit revenues have turned positive and were up 1.5% year-over-year. This performance was right in line with our guidance, even with the greater-than-expected impact from the new reservation system cutover.","The RASM pressure from the reservation system transition was less than a point year-over-year for second quarter. Adjusting for this unfavorable impact, our RASM performance looks to be at least on par with the industry, which is notable considering our very significant outperformance in second quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, the RASM pressure from the transition to our new reservation system is temporary. And these items are relatively minor, considering the significance of the technology efforts. And we expect to have the necessary technology and procedural fixes in place by the end of this year.","For our third quarter, we expect year-over-year RASM growth to be approximately 1%, which includes about one point of unfavorable impact from the reservation system cutover. We do not expect a significant impact beyond third quarter. Our third quarter revenue trends were also impacted by the timing of the July 4 holiday, as well as last year's outage, which roughly offset each other on a unit basis.","Adjusting for the timing of July 4, sequential trends look to be in line with, if not slightly ahead of, historical trends. We had nice growth again in other revenues for second quarter, which increased 7.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased Rapid Rewards. And we expect another year-over-year increase in other revenues in third quarter.","So turning to cost now, our second quarter cost performance was slightly better than expected. Similar to first quarter, fuel prices were higher in the second quarter this year as compared with the same period last year. We saw fuel efficiency gains in the quarter, with the capacity increase outpacing the increase in gallons used. This is meaningful and is being driven by fleet modernization and other fuel savings initiatives. Based on market prices last Friday and our current third quarter hedge position, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.95 to $2 per gallon range, which is below a year ago.","Third quarter fuel cost estimate includes $0.35 in hedging losses, which is comparable to the amount of hedging loss we currently expect for fourth quarter. With fuel hedge losses significantly below where they were last year and the second half of this year, we currently expect our economic fuel price per gallon in fourth quarter to also decrease year-over-year. Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, unit costs came in a little better than we expected, primarily due to lower advertising spend.","We were up 5.3% for the quarter, largely due to higher wage rates from labor contracts as well as technology implementation cost associated with the new reservation system and our operational initiatives. We expect these cost pressures to ease as we go through the remainder of the year. Based on current trends, we expect third quarter CASM, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the 2% to 3% range year over year. Last year's amendments to our labor agreements are driving 3.5 points of the year-over-year increase, which is being partially offset by a slowing technology spend and continued benefits from the retirements of the Classics.","And we continue to expect fourth quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to be comparable with year-ago levels. Considering our modest capacity growth plan for the fourth quarter, I am encouraged by our fourth quarter unit cost outlook, which does reflect our focus on lowering cost. And we intend to do that as well as we move into 2018.","We ended the quarter with our industry-leading investment-grade balance sheet as strong as ever. Our year-to-date free cash flow of $1.4 billion was solid and was driven by strong operating cash flow and manageable CapEx levels. Our expectation for CapEx in 2017 remains at roughly $2.3 billion, with $1.4 billion related to aircraft spend.","During the second quarter, our board of directors approved a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend as well as a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. For the first half of this year, we have returned $1.1 billion in buybacks and dividends to our shareholders. $400 million of these returns were from the accelerated share repurchase program that was launched during second quarter and completed this month, which completed the previous $2 billion buyback authorization. And in June, we paid our 163rd consecutive dividend, which totaled $76 million.","Our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is now just over 30%. And as ever, preserving our strong balance sheet and cash flows remains a priority for us.","Turning now to fleet and capacity, all said, there hasn't been really any significant changes to our fleet or capacity plans. We ended the second quarter with 735 aircraft in our fleet. And as a result of the Classic retirements, we expect our fleet to decline to 688 at the end of third quarter. We'll grow our fleet to 707 aircraft by year-end 2017, and we still expect to be at 750 aircraft at year-end 2018.","With respect to our Classic fleet, we had 69 Classic aircraft in our fleet at the end of the second quarter and are down to 67 today. We intend to retire all 67, of course, by the end of this quarter. As we continue to manage through the retirement of these aircrafts, we purchased two of our 300s previously under operating lease during second quarter. And the lease termination cost associated with this was approximately $8 million, which was recorded as a special item.","At the end of second quarter, we had 21 Classics under operating leases remaining in our fleet. And we expect to record a charge of approximately $60 million as a special item related to these aircrafts, which is primarily related to the lease payments due as of the date we cease use of the Classics.","There could be additional charges recorded in third quarter associated with certain lease return requirements that may need to be performed on the aircraft prior to their return to the lessor, but we don't expect these charges to be significant. And just as a reminder, these charges were contemplated in the estimated $200 million even improvement from accelerating the Classics from 2021 to 2017.","Turning to our order book, we made just some tweaks to the order book. And in short, we added four pre-owned 700s. And with the acquisition of these aircrafts, we deferred our four remaining 737-800 options and converted them to four MAX 8 options, two in 2021 and two in 2022. And we're gearing up for the MAX 8 and we're looking forward to that and expect even more fuel efficiency gains from that aircraft. We'll get our first MAX delivery in August, and we will have 10 by the end of third quarter.","The MAX will enter service on October 1, immediately following our Classic fleet retirement. With this fleet plan, capacity growth in third quarter 2017 is expected to be approximately 4% to 5% and fourth quarter growth in the 1% to 2% range year over year. And our expectations for 2018 year-over-year capacity growth continue to be less than 4% for the first half of the year and less than 2016's 5.7% for the full year. Our domestic network remained strong, and our international flying is maturing nicely. And we continue to grow our network prudently and profitably.","So to close, I'll congratulate our employees again on a great quarter. Our reservation system is up and running. And our employees are doing an outstanding job navigating the new system. Service began in June to Grand Cayman and Cincinnati, and we are excited about our upcoming service to Turks and Caicos in November. The international terminal at Fort Lauderdale opened earlier this month, which supports our current international flying as well as future growth opportunities. The MAX 8 is almost here. And we will be retiring the remaining Classics by the end of this quarter, which is by far the most aircraft we've ever retired in a single quarter in our history. These are very significant accomplishments. And our people, once again, demonstrated their warrior spirit and that they are the best in the industry with their unmatched hospitality.","And with that, Tom, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. This is actually Connor in for Helane. So we appreciate the color on 2018 capacity growth, but can you help break it down a little bit further? I know that the schedules aren't final, but how much of your growth should we expect to be in the domestic market versus international overall? Thanks.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Tammy, I believe that the split is roughly with what is published right now. With the updated forecast for the improved completion factor, I believe it's roughly 3.1 points coming from domestic and the balance coming from...","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","For this year.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","For 2017.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","For this year.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, for the full year, and the balance coming from international. So the domestic mix is still near 3%.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, it's still near 3%. That's correct.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","That doesn't include the additional flights that I mentioned that we are planning to publish soon. And those are domestic flights as well. So that might boost that by a 1\/10 or 2, but it'll be obviously \u2013 it will be very modest since it's just one (22:46) quarter.","Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just to be clear, that's for 2018 or 2017?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I beg your pardon. So that was 2017.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, that's 2017.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Was your question 2018?","Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, sorry.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, we haven't shared that yet. And quite frankly, we haven't made our final choices yet. So you'll have to stay tuned on that one. We opened the schedule today at least through April.","Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. In terms of the reservation system and the cost tailwind that we should associate for that for 2018, so what was the \u2013 was there any cost associated with the reservation system in the second quarter of this year? And what was it again for the third quarter?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","On the reservation system cost, I'll give you kind of a breakdown. As we kind of move through the year here, we \u2013 third quarter, as we get into the third quarter, we do expect that to ease. And we've got just from the technology for the full year, it's going to net to something relatively small. But for the \u2013 I'm pulling here for the second quarter alone. If you'll just bear with me one second, we'll pull that for you. If you'll bear with be we'll get back to you with the number for the second quarter.","Conor Cunningham - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. So look, forgive me because I'm just an equity analyst. But can we talk a little bit more about precisely what's happening with the rollout of the reservation system, why that's negatively impacting RASM and why you think that's only going to be contained in the third quarter? I'd be appreciative.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","We have a handful of items. I would just identify in my mind three that are very isolated. And the new system for these three items does not work like the old system. So \u2013 and Southwest is unique. So one of the items that's pretty easy to visualize is we have a product called Business Select that we sell that allows the customers to have the first 15 boarding positions and their choice of seats once they get on the airplane.","There is a corollary product that we call Upgraded Boarding for any seat that have not been sold yet as Business Select, our customer service agents can sell those seats for a price at the gate. So this is when you're there for departure. And that particular product is not \u2013 it is not working as we would intend it to work, and we are not getting the Upgraded Boarding revenue. It's not a huge amount of money, but it's an example that we're describing.","So you think about just the vast majority of our customers, they are \u2013 the new system is working very, very well with no real change in our \u2013 in the new system versus the old system. There are a couple of items like that. The more material one is a little harder to explain, and it's with our groups. So we do have a product for 10 or more people that are traveling. And a lot of that in the back office is manual.","So the new system is a little bit harder and more cumbersome, I think is probably the easiest way for \u2013 as a lay person to describe it. And the (27:20), but the issue is when we have groups that cancel, it is harder for our people to identify those cancellations go in and reopen that seat inventory and then resell those seats. And that's where we're seeing a revenue penalty, if you will, from the groups.","So there's a couple \u2013 and that's the biggest one. So there's a couple of items like that. There's \u2013 fixes are already designed. The construction is underway. And now, it's just a matter of when will they be done. And obviously, Tammy and I are hopeful that they'll be done yesterday. But those \u2013 and we intend \u2013 we expected that we would have some things like that, but those were a couple that we just didn't anticipate.","In fairness, we have some things that are positives too that went into effect with the new system. But these negatives are offsetting the positives right now. So it has nothing to do with the elegance of the system, whether it meets our needs, whether it will be able to realize our benefits. These are just a couple of one-off items that we found, that we'll fix and we'll get behind us.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate going a little bit more in depth there. And then I wanted to talk to your comments as well as you're getting the aircraft in the fleet a little bit faster this year. It sounds like you're still talking about 4% capacity growth in the front half of 2018. Does that mean you're finding incremental opportunities for capacity next year, given that that growth was most likely slated for earlier in the year in 2018?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","If I understand your question, I think what we are about to publish in terms of additional flights, they are flights that we have already planned for next year and we're simply accelerating them to 2018, if that's the answer to your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Sorry, it was a convoluted way to ask it...","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","In other words, if you fast forward to the end of 2018, we're not doing anything right now that would end up more trips, in theory at least, than what we were contemplating before. That's just what the caveat that we're only published through April and we are still working on what we want to do for the balance of 2018. But I think conceptually, all we're doing with the additional fourth quarter flying is we're accelerating already planned adds into the fourth quarter.","The other color commentary I would offer up there is it's a little painful for us here in the fourth quarter to ground the Classics. And in order to continue with funding of some additional flying that's already committed for end 2017, we're having to make cuts in areas that we don't like. So this is an opportunity for us to restore some of those more painful cuts. And as I mentioned before, these are kind of no-brainer opportunities for us where we're very confident that there'll be profit added to the quarter. They were planned additions in the first place. We just found the airplane time available and been able to accelerate it.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","And if I could jump in here, Gary, just to add a little color on the first question. The technology year-over-year impact in the second quarter was in the $10 million to $15 million range. And for the first half of the year, we had pretty heavy spending as well in the first quarter. And that was probably another, call it, $35 million. So for the first half of the year, we've \u2013 the impact is about $50 million, and which will be a headwind as we \u2013 or rather a tailwind as we move into the second half.","As we move into the second half of the year, we'll see the \u2013 basically the year-over-year comparisons essentially go away. So we'll be back in line for the most part in third quarter and fourth quarter with respect to our technology spend.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","There's kind of a punch list along those lines. The technology spend may be a little bit more complicated to think about the future. But we have ramped up our training. There's overtime hours associated with that. So that's a cost bubble, if you will, during this second quarter for our operations team. We've staffed up significantly in our call centers to handle the cutover. And we have committed plans for that, through attrition, for that head count to trend back down. So that will be somewhat of a cost bubble not just to the second quarter. So that will ease back over time.","And then there is some amount \u2013 there's tens of millions \u2013 call it $10-ish million that is related to simply having payment for two reservation systems simultaneously. It's a smaller number, but that will cease as well. So \u2013 there's a fair number of things there. The hard part about the technology is we have a lot of work to do in our technology group. And the question then becomes, well, do we replace that technology spend that was for that new reservation system and put that money to something else? So that's not what we want to do. We haven't set our budget yet for 2018 for that. But there's clearly a handful of items here that will result in some material improvement, I think, going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Since we're on the topic \u2013 on the cost side, it looks like you're kind of exiting the year at a flat year-over-year rate. Any reason we should believe that cost could be down year-over-year next year on the...","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","We \u2013 yes, you're exactly right, Savi. As we get to the fourth quarter, we'll be trending towards flat year-over-year due to a number of tailwinds. And as we look forward to 2018, I do think we have opportunities to improve our cost. We're working through our 2018 plan now, and that certainly would be the goal.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","That'd be the objective, yes.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","But I'd like to come back and give guidance later this year. But that's certainly what our desire is, is to bring unit cost down year-over-year in 2018, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing. And by the way, Savi, just looking at the market as we get past our fuel hedge losses, we'll have relative to the market this year, we'll have nice comparisons on the fuel side as well. So as we end the year here and move into next year, I'm feeling pretty good about our cost position.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I am too. I think these are all qualitative thoughts. In fairness to both of us, we just haven't put a pencil to it yet. We haven't worked through all of our wants and needs for 2018, but the Classics are gone. Some of these res \u2013 transition costs won't be repeated. And just the benefits of having the MAX in the fleet and just overall fleet modernization, and we'll grow a little more next year than we're growing this year. And that's beneficial on the cost side too. So I think those are all reasonable assumptions at this point. And just give us another quarter or so to finalize our plans, and we can give you better guidance for next year.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. And just somewhat tied to that, we're hearing on several \u2013 a couple of different calls that there are kind of these certain areas, aggressive pricing going on even in the walk-up fares in certain hubs. And I'm just kind of curious if you're seeing that. And two, if you're going to see cost lower next year, is there as much pressure to kind of push through pricing increase? I think that was (36:16) this year just because of the level of cost increases. But how do you think about kind of pricing out there?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well again, I would kind of go back to my earlier comments, which I feel like the second quarter was a very strong revenue performance, I think that the third quarter outlook is more of the same. It is very competitive. It's competitive now. It's been competitive for years, as we all know. So there's a lot of action. There's adds, there's subtracts. And despite all of that, we had a really strong second quarter. And I think again, we'll have a strong third quarter. So implicit in that is stable is my report.","Now, are we seeing fare activity along the lines that you described? Absolutely. But one statistic I think that you all would enjoy that I did jot down for this quarter as an example is, for the first time in a while, the majority of our markets are showing unit revenue gains year over year. And for a while, it was a minority of the markets over the past year or so, to my recollection. You can see the granular strength market-by-market. There are some markets that are under pressure. But overall net-net, we're seeing more strength than we are weakness.","And the other thing that is encouraging is we purposefully slowed our growth for 2017. We purposefully reduced the mix of markets under development in the system in 2017. So we're now down to what is a more normal level of about 3% to 4%. And just looking at the quote, developing markets as an entity, they showed very nice same-store year-over-year gains in the second quarter, which again is very encouraging. So we want to be as aggressive as we dare with our capacity. But overall, we want to be cautious and we want to make sure that we're hitting our revenue and our profit targets.","As to next year and the way to think about it, we'll start the year, I'm sure, with a goal to have positive unit revenue performance in 2018. But I know our leadership team would agree that the overall goal is to sustain or grow our margins. So I think we've got an opportunity to do that. We've already talked about the all other than fuel cost outlook for 2018, which right now we're all kind of excited about that.","But in addition to that, we're going to have a fuel price decline next year. So it's set up very well. We're not intending to grow aggressively at all next year, although the percentage increase will be higher than 2017. But we want to manage it in such a way that we drive unit revenue gains and strong margins.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's all very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks very much. Tammy, just given some of the tweaks to the fleet, can you just update us on where you see CapEx in 2018? I think at the Investor Day, the charts that you had showed aircraft CapEx down about $600 million or $700 million. Is that still what you guys are expecting?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, even with the tweaks, we're still expecting our total CapEx to be \u2013 we're hoping to bend it down from the $2.3 billion level, but I would say at\/or below the $2.3 billion is our goal for next year. So I think at least with the fleet changes that we have, we'll be within that guidance.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I mean, I guess that's a lot different than what the message was from Investor Day. Have there been changes on the aircraft side?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Changes from the aircraft side? No, other than the \u2013 so the goal is to bend down from the $2.3 billion, which is in line, that's total CapEx.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Yeah, maybe I can just follow up offline because aircraft and non-aircraft should be down pretty substantially next year. I guess, is that not what you're saying? I mean instead of bending down, it should be down quite a bit.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, we, as I said earlier, we are working through our plan next year for CapEx.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Take it down in 2019 for sure off of the top-line there.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","It's down, yeah. So we'll be down next year, but we're finalizing all of the non-aircraft spend. So technology of course is a piece of that. So we're finalizing what that is going to be for next year. And with this year, just to give the magnitude of that, that's $250 million. And facilities, that's running about $300 million this year. So we're working through all those details for our plan next year, with our goal to bring the total CapEx spend down. But I just don't have a number to give you today, Joe.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then Gary, I think back on the fourth quarter call, you kind of talked about loyalty program disclosures and how you guys wanted to communicate the value that you get from selling miles to Chase. Can you just provide us with an update as to what you think a proper set of disclosures would look like or a better way to kind of communicate to the market, how good of a business that is for you?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Tammy, you want to answer that.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","I'd be happy to. Well, I can answer your question. That is a really good business for us. Our Rapid Rewards revenue, other revenue was up significantly in the quarter, double digits year over year. So it continues to be a strong contributor.","In terms of the disclosure, understand your desire there for more disclosures. And we are looking at that, and we're working to provide additional disclosures. But we need to determine what information would be most useful to all of our investors while protecting our competitive strategy as well as honoring our contractual commitments. So we're working to strike the right balance there. And in terms of when you might expect us to potentially expand our disclosures, we're looking to do that in the first quarter of next year with the New Year.","And keep in mind too, we've got a new revenue standard coming out. So we're looking at all of that together. And that's kind of the timeline we're looking at in terms of providing the disclosures along the lines that I know you're looking for.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. So it's probably safe to assume you guys are looking like a high-single digit capacity growth rate in 2018. But look beyond that, you guys are only growing your fleet count by about 2.5% in 2019, even if you exercise the options that you have in the fleet plan right now. And I know we're a long way away and things are going to change, but Gary, I was kind of hoping maybe you'd kind of put your thumb in the air a little bit and talk about that at a high level. Should we think about maybe 2018 as sort of a transition year, a little bit of catch-up growth from the artificially-depressed growth this year, and that you get back to like GDP-ish-like number in 2019 on capacity, with the caveat things can change?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes. No thumbs in the air, sorry. So I think we'll first focus on our 2018. We're not seriously contemplating any changes to our fleet plan for 2019. And we'll see how things develop for this year and next year. And then we'll set our plans for 2019 accordingly.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I think that's fair. Thanks, I appreciate that. And then let me talk about Hawaii for a second. You're going to announce that if and when you announce it, I'm not asking you to talk about that at all. But would it be fair to assume that you have to solve for some complicated maybe product-related things that make the decision a little more difficult, like say catering or seat assignments or overwater IFE or something like that, before you consider competing there? And \u2013 or do you think just like brands and low fares are alone are simply enough to sort of have a Southwest Effect in the traditional sense in that market?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, we've got operational challenges that would certainly be unique for us with Hawaii, and I think that's the bigger issue for us. Our experience so far on \u2013 the gist of your question is we haven't ran into that in other markets. So it's pretty much the Southwest you know and love. It's very successful everywhere we fly. And recognizing that we want to be humble about this and recognizing that Hawaii may be different, we may want to evaluate that. But we haven't made any decisions obviously about Hawaii at this point. And my belief is that when we do, if \u2013 it's not \u2013 if we were going to go, it's when we go. We think it's an important strategic offering that Southwest needs to make at an editorial point. But when we do that, it's my belief that it will be off-the-shelf Southwest Airlines. The IFE, we're investing in IFE to at least our onboard WiFi and television product to improve that performance this year.","And Tom, off the top of my head, I don't recall whether that provides for overwater or not. It's obviously satellite-delivered service. It will \u2013 so I think, Hunter, we'll have that, and we think that's important also. But our snack offerings, we do tailor to the distance of the segment. It seems to work fine. It's not \u2013 I get a lot of customer feedback. I don't typically get a lot of feedback on food offerings, although we do get some. So it's \u2013 I would think that it will fit within the way our provisioning works today. Whether we want to be something that is a little more unique for Hawaii, we haven't \u2013 you can tell we haven't discussed that yet, but it won't be anything that's dramatically different.","Our catering is pretty straightforward, and it is snack-oriented, doesn't require refrigeration. We manage the shelf life carefully, all of those kinds of things. And I would think that Hawaii would fit right into that just fine.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for the time. Just a question for you on the Classics, as you look to retire those going into the fourth quarter or end of the third quarter. So can you maybe just provide some color on the impact that has to unit revenues? Do Classics tend to have higher RASM? I'm just trying to make sure I'm aware of any dilutive potential as we move forward, or the opposite, if that makes sense, Gary?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes. I think your \u2013 on the revenue side of things, it's not so much that it's the Classic per se, it's just the gauge. So we're \u2013 we'll definitely be back to Hunter's previous question. A lot of the growth that's anticipated in 2018 is gauge-related. So you're swapping out a 137 or a 143-seater for a 175-seater. I think in most cases, we're getting some 700s.","So yes, there'll be \u2013 you've seen that up-gauging since 2013. So that will continue. Tammy, I don't know if you're ready to give a gauge and a gauge guidance for next year, but there'll be some gauge inflation, if you will.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, I would expect.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","On the cost side \u2013 I think you know all that and I think Tammy, it's also fair to say on the gauge, to the extent that there is some revenue dilution, that's all factored into your $200 million EBIT number through 2020.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","That's correct.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Sorry but on the Classic, the RASM is I guess typically higher than on some of these other aircraft, just given the smaller gauge? Is that fair?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","No. Well, again, it is the seats. So we have \u2013 the 700s are the same seats as the Classics.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So that \u2013 I probably didn't make that clear. And the 700s are the majority of our fleet. So for the most part, I would assume about 80% of the Classics will be replaced with a higher-gauge aircraft, tail for tail. I am putting my thumb in the air on that one. I think that's kind of a rough justice on that one. But the \u2013 so if the \u2013 what Mike was just saying is that there's also a shorter-haul orientation for the Classics.","However, we'll still replace short-haul flight with a 700. So I don't think there's any change per se, because you're replacing a Classic with a light seated aircraft. I think that's all the same. But obviously if we're trading it out for a higher gauge, well then yes, there'll be some RASM effect of that, but there ought to be a \u2013 the way to think about it is, yes, the RASM might show lower, but the costs are being lower still. So you're going to get an operating income benefit, tail by tail by trading a Classic for an 800, under the assumption that we schedule the 800 in a way that it's full. And we've done a pretty good job of that. My hat's off to our folks. We had another record load factor in the second quarter. So that's all good stuff related to the Classics.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, helpful. And then just a quick one, Tammy or Gary, you made some comments about the rating upgrade at Moody's, et cetera. I guess, you're now A rated. Is that sort of the goal longer term? I mean to me, it seems like that might be maybe too strong of a position on the leverage side, but just want to hear your thoughts.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, we're trying to strike the right balance there. We do want to maintain our investment-grade rating, but at the same time manage our capital structure. In terms of our kind of leverage goals over the longer term, and historically these have ebbed and flowed over the years, but just sort of as a longer-term goal, maintaining a leverage somewhere in the low 30% range feels about right.","So certainly, don't intend to drive our leverage down really below where we are today. But somewhere in the low to mid-30% range feels about right. So \u2013 but we've always had a strong balance sheet as one of our top priority. So that certainly isn't going to change. But we certainly want to continue to optimize our capital structure as well. So I think we're balancing all of that pretty well.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","You didn't necessarily ask for the philosophy, but I'll just pile on to what Tammy said. The \u2013 I agree with your \u2013 the direction of your question, which is corporate finance theory would suggest there's a more optical rating, let's say, BBB, maybe BBB+. But we want \u2013 we'd like to have some cushion because there will be bad times and our strong balance sheet has served us very well.","You know the 46-year history and there is no airline that comes remotely close. And the balance sheet strength is one of those shock absorbers that has really helped us in bad times. The philosophical point to argue here is we are still going to manage the company under the assumption that there will be very difficult times again. I've heard comments about things are different now. Maybe, but we're going to make sure that Southwest is very well positioned to weather the storm.","And so we're delighted to have that upgrade and still want to have adequate leverage. But we're not trying to fine tune this \u2013 we're not trying to hit the BBB. We're trying to be better than that, so that we can absorb the blow if times get bad and we don't fall into junk. And over the past 15 years, there's been risk of that at times. And bad things happen there, and we don't want that to happen.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question. We'll take our last question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to ask a couple of quick ones for Tammy. Could you maybe comment for a moment or just expand somewhat around the higher unit cost in the back half of the year. Sort of what specific buckets would be driving those when we think about your prior guidance?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure. So I was having a little bit difficult time hearing you there, Jack. But I think what your question was, is, as we move through the year, how should we expect our comparisons to \u2013 how should the second half comparisons be relative to the first half of the year? So, we do have a number of tailwinds and just to recap those for you. We have of course as we get to the fourth quarter, we'll lapse the impact of the labor contracts. So that's about a one to two-point tailwind as we move into the second quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we have about call it $50 million in technology costs that represent about a point. So we'll see some \u2013 our cost pressures ease in that area and then...","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Why is it higher than our previous?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, we had heavy spend again last year, and also just some onetime costs associated with our reservation system. So we have about a one point tailwind as we move into the second half. And then the benefits from just our Classic fleet is about another point. And then as Gary was mentioning earlier kind of wrapped up in other is just some of the training costs and so forth that will ease as we move into the fourth quarter. So that's how we end up, and fourth quarter with kind of flat unit cost comparison. So it's coming from a number of different areas.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I wasn't able to hear his question. I'll just repeat it, Jack.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","I'm sorry.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","You were coming in very faint. His question was our previous guidance was one thing, and now it's higher. What's driving the increase in the guidance?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Oh, I apologize. I did hear your question differently. What's driving our guidance from where we were previously is we have, I guess, just at a high level kind of going back to the technology, it's really related to that. We were seeing our overall technology spend hasn't really changed dramatically. But we are seeing a shift of that spend to more of an operating mix than what we had anticipated in our forecast.","So the overall spend isn't really changing, but we are seeing a little more operating expense pressure than what we had planned for. So I'm going \u2013 and so really the flip of that is in our CapEx. So, I do think we'll come in a little bit lower than our $2.3 billion CapEx for the year. And offset there is on our operating costs.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, okay. Thank you for that. And sorry if I was coming through faint on my question.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","No, I apologize. You were very faint, but it's good to hear your voice.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Likewise. And then just my follow-up question on the $103 million hedge asset that you called out in the press release for FY 2018 through FY 2020, how much of that hedge asset is specifically related to FY 2018?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Of 2018, it's about $40 million.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, okay. Thank you very much.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","You're very welcome.","Operator","And that concludes the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining.","Presentation","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.","Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the media representatives who are on our call today. We can go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion of the call for the news media. Tom, if you will give them some instructions to queue up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin with our first question. Our first question comes from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, I was just wondering what's your thoughts on from what you've seen in Washington D.C. around the air traffic control debate. Are you optimistic that that is proceeding as you'd hoped and that there might be progress made on that before the end of the year?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, let me answer it this way. I am delighted that we have the focus from the administration. I'm grateful for that. I'm delighted that we have the focus from Chairman Shuster. And we have wonderful alignment between the commercial airlines, Chairman Shuster and the administration.","There is just a lot of controversy about the change, and I'd be the first to recognize that. There is good momentum. Congressman Sam Graves from Missouri signed on to the legislation. And I thought that that was a very significant move. And he is very concerned about private aircraft operators. Chairman Shuster, I should say, was able to convince him along with the industry that there were protections in the proposed bill there.","So I remain hopeful that we can get something done. But, Conor, I have to admit that there is just a lot, a lot of work to do. And I don't know that there is a vote scheduled in the House yet, which means that they may not have all the votes that they feel like they need. The Senate, of course, is far behind where the House is, and there is a lot of work left to be done there. But we need to make progress in the House first to have any hope of getting something done.","My concern overall is that if we don't accelerate the pace, that we will face a real capacity crisis in the air. Because it takes longer and longer to operate flight segments, so the air space is getting less and less efficient. Our air traffic controllers do a wonderful job of keeping the airplanes safe, but they do that by slowing things down more and more and more. And of course, for air traffic controllers to use the old technology that they're forced to use is very, very cumbersome. And they're understaffed.","So there is just a lot of things that must change if our country is to continue to grow air travel and people want to fly. So I think that's \u2013 we need to keep our eye on the ball and worry less about some of the other politicking that's going on. And so hopefully, we will make some progress this year.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal.","Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Oh, good afternoon. Gary, I was reading about this new plane. I think it's called the 737 MAX. You might have heard of it. I think Tammy said you were...","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I have.","Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Excellent. I think Tammy said you were due to get 10 in the third quarter. What are you expecting in the fourth quarter and kind of tallied to that, have you sort of picked up anything from those who have already started operating the MAX? And given some of the issues in the engine supply chain, which do seem to be spreading to leap a little bit, do you have confidence that none of those are going to slip into 2018?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","We will have 10 on October 1 when we start service. And then we'll end the year with 14. Mike, do you want to talk about the airplane and what you've heard from Boeing and other operators around the world?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","That airplane has been just really from the day that they designed it until the day that they delivered it, they have been on their timeline. And it appears to be a better airplane, more efficient airplane today than what we thought we were buying years ago. I haven't heard of any issues, or Boeing has not made me aware of any issues that caused me any concern with respect to our delivery schedule or in-service dates or the operation of those airplanes.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And Mike is our Chief Operating Officer.","Doug Cameron - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Yeah, okay. That's very clear. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And we have time for one final question \u2013 I'm sorry, we do have the next question from Nicole Raz with Las Vegas Review-Journal.","Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal","Hi, thank you for taking my call. How does Las Vegas' performance stack up this quarter compared to previous quarters and do you have any visions for expansion plans or where does Las Vegas fall in terms of I don't know near-term future plans?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, you know how important Las Vegas is to Southwest. And it's just another opportunity to thank you on \u2013 for representing Las Vegas for all the support we get from your communities. We have a great relationship with the community. We get tremendous support from the airport. We're the largest airline in terms of customers at Las Vegas and have been for many, many years. And it's a very stable market.","I think I will characterize it as very strong. To your benefit, in the community, there is a lot of competition there, and we welcome that. So we certainly hold our own with competition, but Las Vegas will always be an important part of our plans. And we don't have any plans to do anything significantly different here in the near-term. But again we will always keep an eye on Las Vegas and its needs.","And Las Vegas, I believe today is about the third largest operating point that we have in our system. And it, often times, it vies for second and sometimes first. So right now, it's over 200 daily departures, which for us is very, very large.","Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal","And how did Las Vegas in terms of you said third operating point, how do I compare it to first quarter?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","A stable environment, so we're not adding a lot of flights, we're not subtracting a lot of flights, it's very stable, the business is very strong. And I think Las Vegas is enjoying another boom here. So we're happy to be a part of that.","Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal","Thank you. I'm sorry, just two more questions. You were talking a lot about gauge inflation and fleet changes, having a hard time following that. Are we going to see any type of upgrades or new airplanes here in Las Vegas? What does that actually mean?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","You will. And gauge just means it's an industry euphemism. It just means the number of seats on an aircraft model.","Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So 700 and before we get to the MAX, the 700 is the smaller narrow body airplane and the 800 is the larger one. And in our configuration which is all coach, we put 153 seats on the 700. So when we talk about gauge, if we trade a route for an 800 instead of a 700, we would say we're up-gauging that market. Since you asked, another industry euphemism is density. So we put 175 seats on an 800. Our competitors, who have less pitch in the seats, could put, I don't know, like 190 seats? 189, so 14 more seats.","So that is the same gauge of the airplane, but they've chosen to jam more seats in there. So we don't put the same number of seats in as many of our competitors do, because we want you to have a comfortable flight experience. But that's all that means and the rule of thumb in the airline business is the bigger the gauge, the lower the cost per seat and it puts us in a position as long as we can fill the airplane up with customers, that we'll have a lower cost and can keep your fares lower.","So that's the importance of considering the gauge. You just can't take that to an extreme. You'd be flying 400-seat airplanes by that logic and of course only filling up 100 of them, and you'd go out of business really soon.","Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal","Thank you for clarifying. So the timeline that we'll see that bigger gauge here, the 800, is that you said by the end of this year?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","You've got them now. So out of a fleet of, I'll just call it, 700 airplanes, we probably have, I don't know, Mike, 150 airplanes that are the larger gauge 800s. And we fly a lot of those 800s in and out of Las Vegas. So you're already getting those. What we were \u2013 the previous question was on the next generation from Boeing. So it's the new version of the 800. It's called the MAX 8. So the gauge is the same. The seat density is the same as our 800 and we'll have 14 of those by the end of this year.","It has a different engine. It has different performance characteristics. It's lower fuel burn. It's 40% quieter. So the odds of you getting one of those in Las Vegas because it's \u2013 we'll only have 14, are rather low, but I'm sure you'll get them. So we don't dedicate airplanes to a city. They fly all over the country. And so it will be a little bit random as to whether or not you see one. But one of these days, I am sure you will and I hope you get to ride on it, because it's going to be a really nice ride.","Nicole Raz - Las Vegas Review-Journal","Thank you very, very much.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have time for one final question. It does come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Hi. Mike, I just wanted to ask real quick, you talked about the MAX being more efficient now than when you ordered it. Is that just on fuel burn? And can you talk about how that may have changed and if that's what you were referring to?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, Mary, that's what we were talking about. When we were beginning to talk with Boeing about the airplane, it was a PowerPoint airplane. And they were talking about having its fuel burn improvement in the 10% to 11% range. And I think it's closer to 14% now.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","And has it been at that range for a while now, the 14%?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, it has. As they got further along into the design of the airplane, further along into the wing structure and the gear structure and the engines all coming together, they've solidified that and their flight tests have seemed to prove all that out.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda B.

My name is Tom, and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. Joining me on the call today is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President, Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and President of AirTran Airways; Mike Van De Ven, Executive Vice President and COO; and Ron Ricks, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer.","Today's call will begin with opening comments from Gary; followed by Tammy, providing a review of our fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy's remarks, and Gary, Tammy, Bob, Mike and Ron will all be available to take your questions.","As a quick reminder, 2011 full year consolidated results include AirTran beginning May 2, the date of the acquisition. In order to provide what we believe to be a more meaningful year-over-year comparison on today's call, when referring to full year 2012 results compared to 2011, we may provide commentary on a combined basis, as defined in this morning's press release.","Please be advised that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, such as combined results and results excluding special items, please refer to this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","And with that, Gary, I will turn it over to you.","Gary C. Kelly","Thank you, Marcy, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Welcome. We're very pleased to share our fourth quarter earnings results, obviously pleased to report increased earnings for the year 2012, a solid profit in fourth quarter, slightly ahead of expectations and flat compared to 1 year ago, excluding items.","Our operational performance and our customer service delivery were both exceptional in 2012. Our cash flow from operations, if you exclude all the hedging collateral changes, was an all-time record for Southwest Airlines at $2.1 billion for 2012.","And it was an exceptional year for our shareholders, as we were able to repurchase 46 million shares for $400 million, reducing our shares outstanding almost 6%. We also increased the quarterly dividend by 122% in May of last year.","We were also able to pay down $1.2 billion in debt since the May 2011 AirTran acquisition, with the balance sheet leverages declining and very, very strong.","Real story in 2012 was the progress that we made on our strategic initiatives. There are 5 of those: all-new Rapid Rewards, AirTran, the introduction of the 737-800 into our fleet, overall fleet modernization and then our reservation system replacement.","There were significant accomplishments in 2012. There were significant effort and investment, both from a capital and an operating perspective, that were expended on these strategic initiatives.","I'm not satisfied, of course, with 2012's absolute earnings, but it was still a remarkable year given the amount of construction work that is -- that was under way. And our people are transforming Southwest, and in the meantime, they are running a great airline.","Business, for us, has been good. Yields are up. We've had some traffic effect, but load factors remain near record levels.","The timing of Christmas and New Year's put the month of December behind trend and the month of January ahead of trend. But all in all, fourth quarter and first quarter bookings and revenue trends look very solid, at least at this point.","Broadly speaking, while we see a lot of encouraging signs in the broader economy, we're monitoring demand closely for signs of any weakening by consumers resulting from the increased income taxes. But at this point, we're not seeing any signs of any weakness; at least it's buffered by a pretty benign industry capacity forecast. And our forecast is showing that the industry will be down capacity-wise domestically in the 1% to 2% range in the first quarter.","So thinking about 2013, we want to preserve our strong culture, brand and customer service levels; we want to maintain our operational excellence; and we want to regain our financial prosperity. We have a plan to boost revenues this year by $1.1 billion over 2012 levels. We also have efforts underway to increase our aircraft efficiency and utilization and also increase our fuel efficiency on a unit basis.","2012 cost pressures that we were -- that we've been seeing in maintenance, for example, and depreciation, those will begin to ease in 2013. And of course, we're going to be very focused on managing our invested capital. And in particular, our capital spending plan for 2013 will be down from 2012 levels.","But the #1 deliverable for 2013, without a doubt, is the connection of the Southwest and AirTran route networks. That will put us in a position to follow up aggressively to optimize the combined networks as if it were 1. And we have a number of markets that are not performing to our satisfaction, and we will begin to address those gradually throughout 2013. And of course, that is one of our leading drivers in our plans to boost our 2013 revenues by $1.1 billion. And of course, that is what will position us to hit our 15% return on invested capital requirement.","So with that very quick overview, I'd like to turn it over at this point to Tammy Romo, our CFO. And before I do that, I would just like to thank all of our Southwest family one more time for a tremendous 2012. So Tammy, over to you.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. 2012 was a big year of progress for Southwest, as Gary noted. And I would also like to extend my gratitude to all of our Southwest warriors for their hard work and many accomplishments in 2012 that enabled us to report our 40th consecutive year of profits, which really is a remarkable accomplishment in our industry.","Our full year 2012 GAAP net income was $421 million, or $0.56 per diluted share. And if you back out the special items, our 2012 net income was $417 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, which was up 30% versus our 2011 EPS.","We ended the year with a solid fourth quarter performance. Our fourth quarter 2012 net income x special items was $65 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, which exceeded First Call Consensus by $0.01.","Despite challenging year-over-year comps from the December holiday mismatch, Hurricane Sandy and last year's ticket tax benefit, our fourth quarter revenues were strong. Our operating revenues were a record $4.2 billion, driven by record passenger revenues and an impressive growth in cargo revenues. Passenger revenues were a record $3.9 billion. Passenger revenue yield, passenger unit revenues and operating unit revenues were all fourth quarter record.","Also, I want to point out, we changed the income statement classification of certain revenues from purchase points in our frequent flyer program in the fourth quarter. The reclass didn't change our total revenues, our bottom line, but was simply a shift of revenues from other revenues to passenger revenues. And these points are largely redeemed for Southwest flights. The reclass totaled $27 million for the first 9 months of 2012, and our fourth quarter 2012 results reflect $11 million related to this reclass. For purposes of your models, the impact on a monthly basis was immaterial versus what we reported to you in our monthly traffic releases.","On a unit basis, passenger revenues grew 2.3% year-over-year, led by strong October PRASM of close to 6%, followed by a solid November, especially considering the challenging year-over-year comparison.","December was impacted by Christmas return traffic, as Gary mentioned, falling in January. But overall, we had solid holiday traffic over the 2-week periods spanning December and January.","Passenger revenue yield increased 3.4% year-over-year. We implemented 4 systemwide fare increases. And while they had a positive impact to unit revenues, the benefit from recent fare increases has been less than what we've historically realized. And this is a testament to the challenging yield environment and just underscored -- underscores the nice traction our commercial team is making in this difficult environment and in the midst of integrating the Southwest and AirTran network.","We are seeing encouraging signs in our business travel trends. Our mix of close-in passengers for fourth quarter was in line with the third quarter mix of 20%. While our mix was relatively unchanged from third quarter, revenue performance was encouraging.","We continue to be pleased with the strong revenue contribution from our ancillary products and initiatives. Our Business Select revenues were approximately $23 million, a fourth quarter record performance. We recognized another $50 million in incremental passenger revenues from our Rapid Rewards program, bringing this year's total incremental revenue recognized from our new program to $180 million. As we've ramped up our all new Rapid Rewards program, results have been tremendous.","Wright Amendment revenues were also tremendous, increasing 18% year-over-year to $67 million in fourth quarter and with full year 2012 totaling $276 million.","We continue to be very pleased with the revenue contribution from the incremental 800 and Evolve seating. The fourth quarter benefited by over $50 million from the incremental seats and full year 2012 in excess of $100 million.","Overall, our EBIT contribution from fleet modernization was on track with our forecasted $70 million, and we continue to anticipate a $300 million EBIT contribution in 2013.","Traffic and revenue trends thus far in January suggest passenger unit revenues will be up in the 2% to 3% range compared to January of last year.","On Monday this week, we began selling available A1 through A15 boarding positions to customers 45 minutes prior to departure for $40 per flight. This new option is not a replacement for our Business Select Fare or Earlybird Check-In, but simply a creative way to generate revenue on premium boarding positions that are going unused. We tested the new boarding option in San Diego just -- for just over a month, and the customer response was very exciting. While still very early on, the results thus far from this week's launch have been encouraging.","Turning to fourth quarter freight and other revenue performance. Our freight revenues grew nearly 17%, driven by increased shipments as a results of better domestic economic conditions than fourth quarter last year. We currently expect first quarter freight revenues to be comparable to fourth quarter -- our fourth quarter 2012 performance.","Other revenues declined year-over-year in fourth quarter, largely due to the decrease in ancillary revenue from a reduction in AirTran capacity. We currently expect first quarter other revenues to be comparable to first quarter last year.","EarlyBird revenues in fourth quarter was $39 million and for the full year, $161 million, far exceeding our original expectations. We also recognized $70 million in fourth quarter from other seats.","As previously announced, EarlyBird charge will increase from $10 per one-way ticket to $12.50 per one-way ticket effective in March 2013. Beginning next month, fees charge for certain check baggage will also increase. In addition, we plan to tighten the flexibility associated with our least expensive and most restrictive tickets later this year by implementing a no-show fee for customers that do not call ahead to cancel their ticket prior to the originally scheduled flight time. All of these new 2013 revenue streams are expected to contribute an estimated $100 million incremental revenue.","Turning to fuel. Our fourth quarter 2012 economic fuel price per gallon, including fuel taxes, was $3.32 per gallon, which was in line with our most recent expectations and significantly less than our initial guidance of $3.45 per gallon at the beginning of the quarter.","Our hedging premiums, which are included below the line, and other expenses, were $3 million versus $14 million in the prior year. As always, we provided a fuel hedge sensitivity table for your reference in this morning's release. As all of our 2013 fuel hedge positions are based in Brent, you will notice the chart reflects Brent average crude oil scenarios rather than WTI historically presented in this chart.","Based on market prices as of January 18 and our minimal hedge position, our first quarter 2013 economic fuel price is forecasted to be approximately $3.30 per gallon, including a $0.05 locked in loss. As a reminder, after first quarter 2013, we no longer have any exposure to locked in losses from our 2008 legacy hedge portfolio. Our net premium cost for first quarter will be approximately $5 million.","The increase in our fourth quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, was in line with our guidance. As expected, investment in our fleet initiatives contributed about 1.5 to our fourth quarter cost inflation. The remainder of the fourth quarter year-over-year cost inflation related to labor rate and health cost increases.","We currently expect first quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, to increase year-over-year in the 5% to 6% range. However, we expect year-over-year cost pressures, excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items, as Gary mentioned earlier, to ease dramatically in 2013, especially in the back half, as we complete our Evolve retrofits and begin to realize more of our fleet modernization benefits.","On the nonoperating cost side, our net interest expense declined year-over-year from lower debt. We expect first quarter 2013 net interest expense to be comparable to fourth quarter.","We ended 2013 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. And as Gary already covered, our cash flow from operations was very strong at $2.1 billion and free cash flow for the year was over $700 million. With our share repurchases and increased dividends, we returned $422 million to our shareholders. We repurchased $400 million of stock in 2012 or approximately 46 million shares, and that totals $625 million or 73 million shares under our $1 billion authorization.","We made $578 million of debt repayments in 2012, which included the prepayment of approximately $19 million in December related to a high interest aircraft secured loan that we assumed as part of the AirTran acquisition.","Our leverage, including off balance sheet aircraft leases, continued to decline, and it was 41% at year-end.","For 2013, we expect another year of healthy free cash flow. Our 2012 cap spending forecast remains in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range, and our 2013 scheduled debt maturities are expected to be in that $200 million range, which includes our intent to make a $20 million prem payment on another high interest aircraft secured loan from AirTran later this month.","Overall, I am very pleased with our financial position, as we remain investment-grade with strong liquidity, modest debt and a focus on preserving our financial strength and enhancing shareholder value.","Just to give you a quick recap of our 2013 fleet and capacity plan. For 2013, we have 20 firm orders for 737-800s and we expect to transfer 16 717s to Delta. When combined with our Classic retirement schedule, we expect our fleet to be down slightly this year.","We expect our 2013 ASM capacity to increase modestly in the 2% range year-over-year. And of course, this capacity increase is driven by incremental seats from the addition of the 800s and the 6 extra seats from our Evolve retrofits. However, on a trip basis, we'll be down in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year.","For first quarter 2013, we expect capacity to be flat over -- versus 1 year ago. And for second quarter 2013, we expect our available seat miles to increase in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year.","Overall, just very pleased with our 2012 results. Our people have done a just wonderful job navigating through a year full of tremendous accomplishments. Looking at the first quarter, January revenue trends thus far are encouraging, as well as bookings for the remainder of the quarter. We have significant revenue opportunities this year, bolstered by our strategic initiatives in our new revenue stream.","We continue to work diligently to control our cost, and we expect second half 2013 unit cost tailwinds year-over-year as we complete our Evolve retrofits and we begin realizing more cost benefits from our fleet modernization initiative.","We are starting the year with excitement and confidence in our 2013 plan that calls for reaching a 15% ROIC this year.","And with that, Tom, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just 2 questions here. You talk about some of the ancillary revenue opportunities, and I saw the press release out not too long ago that the Row 44 product, I think it's in 300 or 400 of your airplanes. What's -- how is that doing thus far? What's the uptake? What's the opportunity there? How should we think about it?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think considering that the installation time has been pretty lengthy and we haven't had a majority of the aircraft that were installed. As a consequence, we didn't have any marketing awareness or merchandising of that feature behind it in any meaningful way. Considering that, that's about where we are here, Mike, in 2012, I think it's done fine. The reliability of the product was not where we wanted it to be in prior years. It's now running -- last statistics I saw were 98%, which is not quite good enough, but it's not too bad, considering the leading edge technology that it really offers. So we did, last year, Tammy, I think we did $5 million or so in revenue from the product. Obviously, we're looking for a lot more than that. The take rates are -- escape me at the moment, but I want to say that, clearly, long-haul has a better take rate than the short-haul does. It's a little bit behind our expectations. But again, I would attribute a lot of that to comments that I've already made. What is very exciting that we put in the press release, and again, our marketing folks are going to get behind the product this year and start promoting it much more heavily, is we do have a live television feature. It is really good. They're going to increase the offerings with that. And we'll also be in a position where we can offer some video-on-demand. And that's just, of course, in addition to the straight up Internet access. So I think it has a lot of potential. I don't think that history is going to be a guide. And I'm kind of anxious to see what happens here this year. But with -- Bob, so in terms of your $1.1 billion revenue plan, it's not a material element of that.","Robert E. Jordan","It's not.","Gary C. Kelly","So I think that's just pure upside for us.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, good. Just my second question, and Gary, this is for you as well. When I look at some of the DOT stats on part-time versus full-time employees, one thing that sort of stands out, and again, this may be how they crunch the numbers, Southwest seems to be -- seems to have a lot less part-time than most other carriers. And you've seen a lot of the major carriers, some of these has been through the restructurings that they've gone through. They do have a lot more variable cost element to their business. They brought on a lot more part-time employees. And my sense is that, that's going to become -- there may be more of a drive toward that direction, given the change in health care costs and minimum thresholds that people need to work in order to be fully covered versus sort of pay on their own. Is it because Southwest is historically been much more highly unionized than the average carrier? Has that prevented you from pursuing a lot more part-time type opportunities? Or what's behind that number? And again, I'm assuming that the DOT sort of treats everybody on an apples-to-apples comparison in how they count this data.","Gary C. Kelly","Mike, we -- just trying to cut right to the bottom line here, we are more unionized than probably any other U.S. airline. But I don't think the original -- the essence of it initially was because we're unionized. Now it is a factor in union contracts, so we don't have the unilateral ability in all of our union contracts to have unlimited numbers or percentages of part-time. So let me at least acknowledge that, that is a constraint. What is different today compared to even 20 years ago, much less 40 years ago, is the world has changed and the need for flexibility, I think, more than trying to avoid health care cost, it's the need for flexibility that's really driving this, where we don't have an even flight schedule throughout the day. And now we're trying to get into markets like Key West, Florida, which has 2 daily departures. So clearly, you can't have full-time headcount complements there. We do have a fewer -- we have a lighter schedule on Saturday, as an example, and obviously, we don't need as many staff on a day that we have fewer flights. And I think the future really is trying to get the flight schedule matched up better to customer demand, and that will -- that clearly creates a need for more flexibility in the future than what we had in the past. So for whatever reason the world has changed, perhaps we didn't need as much flexibility 30 or 40 years ago, clearly, today, we do. Fuel prices are probably the big game changer there. And it is definitely something that we will need to do in the future to be successful. We'll need more part-time workers in our workforce.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Gary, is it possible for you guys to introduce checked bag fees without damaging the Southwest brand?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, customers hate bag fees, Hunter. So I think that by definition, there would be an impact to the brand.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. Yes, okay. And I guess, as we think about -- this is kind of a -- just a question about your frequent flyer accounting. As your load factors have been driving up over the last couple of years, is there a thought to maybe changing the frequent flyer accounting from incremental cost to deferred revenue? And if so, what kind of impact should we expect on the financial statements if you were to make that change?","Gary C. Kelly","Tammy, do you want to answer that?","Tammy Romo","Yes. At this point, we're not contemplating any change in our frequent flyer accounting program.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just as we look through the quarter, there's obviously potential to get deeper into the quarter, there's a lot of things moving around on the RASM side. I'm just curious how sort of 2 factors plan to how we should think about the comp progression. One is, I mean, it looks like you're running a schedule that's much more March heavy than it's been in the past. So you have a nice -- you have a more of an uptick in ASMs in March. And then the second thing is you've got the codeshares pulling in. I'm just wondering, how do we balance those 2 things? I mean, should we be thinking about a March RASM comp that's more impacted by the capacity and not enough time with codesharing? Just any help there would be great.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think that, that is a fair question. I think it's a little bit premature to suggest that we're going to have a challenge in March. I think the best -- it's seasonal, so I think the best thing we have going for us with a little more capacity in March is just the fact that, that's when demand really begins to surge. You are correct, at least in my opinion, in assuming that there won't be a whole lot of codeshare traffic realized in the month of March. We really don't have all of that optimized until the 1st of April. So March will miss that. As we look at the broader economic trends, it seems to support the current, the sort of the fourth quarter unit revenue growth rate. Tammy shared with you what we've seen so far in January. And as long as the economy doesn't take a hit from the increase in income taxes, which really [ph] doesn't -- there's no sign of that yet. I'm not overly concerned about March. Tammy, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Tammy Romo","Yes. The only thing I would add to that is just a reminder that March does have the benefit of early Easter versus April in 2012. And then just as you think through the sequential trends, January, of course, benefited from the shift on holiday traffic, so when you look at sequential trends from January to February, that would -- you just want to think through that as you compare that to average. That's in -- I think, when you look at how Easter falls, if you look at historical trends where Easter was in March, I don't think there's really anything, at least at this point, that we're expecting that would be unusual and as you try to trend this throughout the first quarter. And then as you pointed out, codeshare, certainly, that benefit would be more in April.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, just even thinking a little longer term on codeshare. I mean, when you think back to the ATA codeshare, and I know it's in much smaller scale. But you obviously have a booking curve that's got to get into place. But was there also any signs of sort of a spool up above and beyond that? Or is that once you sort of turn on the codeshare, work through the booking curves, you kind of get your fair share, so to speak? Or is it consumers have to take some time to learn that it's out there?","Gary C. Kelly","You're testing our collective memories prior to the summer of '08. But it's pretty instant. You publish these itineraries. And that's where the brand comes in so strong as -- if you have people that come to southwest.com looking for itineraries, they don't know what dots we connect. And so, it's pretty immediate. Because that's the only way you're going to get it. In other words, we're -- you won't have billboards out there promoting these new itineraries, so the only way people are going to find it is by coming to southwest.com. So I think it ought to ramp up pretty quickly. But again, we're -- we don't have any way to -- there's no empirical forecast that we can share. It's just based on our judgment and just the logic that you're applying. And certainly, that was our experience with ATA.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jim Parker with Raymond James.","James D. Parker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Is it correct that your AirTran synergies are in line with your expectations?","Tammy Romo","Yes. They are tracking right in line thus far.","James D. Parker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. It would be a little inconsistent, I guess, with what we're seeing in Atlanta because you have taken down flights rather dramatically. And I -- my question would be, how is Atlanta as a focus point performing, and what is your game plan? Because in the beginning, we were concerned that it would take a -- it would have a very negative impact on Delta, and now it appears actually it's pretty good for Delta. So what is -- are you realizing the synergies in Atlanta that you anticipated, and what's the game plan for Atlanta?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I don't know that I can apply the synergies to a location, Tammy, as I'm thinking out loud here. The -- and Jim, the other thing that I am reacting to is the \"taking down the capacity.\" So I think, we're about, in terms of total flights between Southwest and AirTran, on a combined basis, we're about where we were when we bought AirTran. The problem with Atlanta right now -- the problem with the AirTran flight schedule right now is that it is suboptimized. So we closed 14 airports in 2012. At the same time, we've begun to introduce flying at Southwest with the thought that it will eventually all convert from AirTran into Southwest Airlines. So there is no doubt that it's suboptimized. By extension, because the majority of AirTran flying goes through Atlanta, Atlanta is suboptimized. So I don't think there's any -- there's no secret about that. I think despite all of that, we're still on track realizing synergies. Understanding, Jim, again, I think Tammy and her team have been very clear on this, the synergies so far in '11 and '12 are really cost driven, not revenue driven. So '13, once we connect the networks and then begin this optimization effort, this is the year where Bob and his team are going to be bringing a lot of revenue synergies to the table.","Tammy Romo","Yes, Jim, you'll start to see that flip a little bit here in 2013. So as we continue to bring AirTran employees over to Southwest, you'll see the -- we'll have more cost to synergies. But of course, the thought here and the plan here is that those would be more than offset as we begin connecting the network. So clearly, the revenue synergies will come on much more significantly once we codeshare and have the ability to optimize our Atlanta flying.","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, David (sic) [James]. This is Bob. I would just add a couple of things. There are real positive signs in Atlanta, like the gains we've seen at local passengers. It really is, as Gary said, the inability to just optimize the networks because we don't have the connectivity. So where we have been able to, for example, manage the capacity in overlap markets, we've seen really good results. A lot of that we just cannot do until we have the connectivity. And so you're just running a suboptimized AirTran network in Atlanta. The flight schedule, I think, we're -- as Gary said, we're right on top of about where we are. We might be down 10 to a dozen flights from a year, 18 months ago, but it's -- a lot of that relates to the number of aircraft that have been converted out of AirTran already to pull -- and we've had to pull the schedule down there. But where we've had a lot of optimization techniques and changes are going to come with the connectivity, that will be starting here in the next couple of weeks and continue to the first quarter. And I'm just very optimistic about what that will do for our revenue performance once we can really optimize the combined network.","Gary C. Kelly","Jim, again, and hopefully, we're not over explaining here, but we haven't done anything in Atlanta, I think, is sort of the bottom line. Except to begin the process of unhubbing it. And so I think all of the cities that we closed were tied in to Atlanta. So we're just -- this is the year where we really get to work on building Atlanta. And the nice thing is we've had just such a wonderful reception in the community. So we're very pleased with the reaction to the Southwest brand. And I think we are in a -- from our perspective, we're just getting started in 2011. And to be at this point, I think is very exciting for us. So we got a big year coming up, though, for Atlanta, no question.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Regarding your full year CASM guidance, any update, maybe I missed it here, to the sort of 1% growth rate that you've -- I think you put forth at Investor Day.","Tammy Romo","No update. That is still our guidance.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just tell me what that assumes regarding new labor agreements and how you'd handicap a new pilot agreement this year?","Tammy Romo","It is based on our current contract.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And how would you handicap the odds of a new pilot agreement this year?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I -- that's nothing that I can predict. So we are in negotiations with more groups than our pilots, of course. And we will have more groups coming online this year. So we'll have a lot of labor discussions underway. They're all productive. And of course, we have the benefit that we've always enjoyed here, which is a very strong culture. And I think our employees are very interested in maintaining our low-cost leadership and growing Southwest Airlines. I think everyone understands, we have to hit our prosperity targets. So we're -- I think we're very encouraged about the support that we see on that front from our labor groups.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that detail, Gary. And then just with respect to the sort of priority boarding at the gate. Can you talk about, on average, how many of those A1 through A15 boarding slots are typically open at departure? Or are you now blocking those off going forward?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, let me give it -- I'll let Tammy do a little math in her head here while I'm at least framing this up. So I think you understand well. But for everyone's benefit, we have a new boarding process in 2007. We bring out a new product called Business Select. And that has more than just priority boarding as features with it, and it costs more money. In 2009, we brought out EarlyBird, which allows for a $10 fee that will soon be $12.50, automatic check in and also more of a priority in the boarding process. What we were missing was a feature or a product at the airport. And so this is filling that gap. We do 6% or 7% of our boardings, I think, by Business Select, probably more than double that by EarlyBird. So I don't think it will sell that many of this product. There are plenty of the A1 to A15 boarding positions. If you kind of back in with the math -- I just can't do that in my head. But I wouldn't suggest that you all assume that we'll be selling 10 of these per departure. I don't think it's anything like that. And Bob, your assumptions are much, much more modest.","Robert E. Jordan","Yes. The assumptions that were baked into the revenue plan that we shared with you at the Analyst Day were very modest. And so we're talking about selling 1 or less than 1 per flight. Because again, as Gary said, it just fills the gap in terms of something that's available at the gate. Now we ran a test for about a month in San Diego. And the test was very positive. It was positive both in terms of the feedback from our customers and our employees. We heard a lot of \"wow, this is the best thing you've ever done\" kind of feedback from both sides. And on the take rate, we actually had a take rate in that test, which was not publicized, which exceeded our expectations, so, by a little bit. So I'm very encouraged about the product in total. It launched on Monday. So we have just a little bit of data so far. I wouldn't draw many conclusions from that, but I'm very encouraged about number one, the fact that the product does fill a gap that our customers want. And number two, that will hit the financial targets that we embedded in our plan for 2013 around that product.","Tammy Romo","Yes. And just in terms of the potential benefit and what we have baked in to the plan. As you will recall, it's part of the $100 million guidance we have for all of our new 2013 ancillary revenue initiatives. But just for this product, it's potentially in the tens of millions. So we feel really good about it so far based on the early results.","Gary C. Kelly","And again, Duane, we can wrap this up for you. I'm sure we've given you more than you want. But the -- just to frame it up, Business Select, our target was $100 million a year, and we're real close to that in 2012. EarlyBird is more robust. So it's not $200 million, but it's getting closer to that. So this is far more modest than either Business Select or EarlyBird, we think. If it's better than that, I think that will be fine, too.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, just a follow-up on the bag fees concept. Years ago, when you introduced the no-bag-fees policy, you used to talk about how much you benefited on the PRASM side through a load factor growth and even some yield strength by not charging the fees. I'm not sure if you can quantify that benefit today. But if you were to pursue bag fees, wouldn't it follow that we'd see significant pressure on either yields or loads that could more than offset the benefits of the fees? Or has something changed about that framework today?","Gary C. Kelly","Oh, no. I think you're exactly right. And of course, the longer -- the more the time goes by, the more chance we have to research this and experiment. But our judgment at the time was that we would be revenue positive by virtue of the fact that we would get more customers, and that would outweigh the direct fee revenue. In the intervening years from -- -- that was lost in '09. In the intervening years, our market share, adjusting for capacity changes, has been up as much as 2 percentage points at times. So yes, we've consistently shared that the best estimate that we had was about $1 billion increase annually from these market share gains, which we attribute much of that to our baggage policy. What marketing has begun to do more scientifically here in 2012 is much more specific research. Because now customers know. I mean, they know what we do. They know what others do. And so you can introduce a series of questions. And in doing that, interestingly enough, it supports the argument that we've been making that it would cost us, and it would cost us something close to $1 billion. Now who knows if that is true until you try to do that. But in any event, that is our judgment. And we don't have any plans to charge for bags at this time.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's really helpful. And just some of your competitors have suggested that continued rationalization in the industry is going to raise returns at the legacy airlines, mostly in the domestic market as opposed to international. When you think about what that might mean for Southwest, if it's true, would that be an opportunity to ride sort of the rising tide of improving domestic returns? Or is that more of an opportunity to bring back this sort of virtuous cycle of taking advantage of markets where competitors are earning too much by growing market share and then using that growth to keep cost low and reinforce your advantage there? How do you think about that?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think our overarching goal is safety and financial prosperity. And it is just through that mechanism that we can take care of our people, take care of our customers, take care of our shareholders. So it has to be with the goal in mind that we're going to hit our 15% return on invested capital target. Clearly, if you think about the big 3 factors on us, externally, it's the economy, fuel prices and competition. So if competition eases in markets, that's just going to make it more attractive for us and certainly could facilitate us hitting our 15% return.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But it's fair to say that until you've hit those -- until you hit that return target, we probably wouldn't see this -- more of this bringing back the virtuous cycle kind of angle? Is that a fair concept?","Gary C. Kelly","I'm not sure I agree with your virtuous cycle terminology.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","What I'm getting at is just more accelerating capacity growth.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, the world is just not that black and white. So the answer to your question in the sense that yes, that is our overarching goal is to achieve financial prosperity, which is specifically defined as 15% returns. So that will be -- we've got to have a belief that we're on a path to do that or we shouldn't be taking any actions to the contrary of that. Whether or not we're going to be more aggressive at a point in time or less aggressive with capacity, I'm not taking that off the table. I mean, that's one of our biggest competitive advantages, it's our low cost, our superior customer service. And you simply weaken a company by retreating. So we'll definitely want to continue to be aggressive but mindful of the fact that we need to hit our 15% return.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If I was to walk into the headquarters and survey Southwest employees as to which department wields more clout, the finance department or the marketing department, what do you think the answer would be? And the reason I'm asking here is when I think about your accounts, trends and raising fares or first bag fees, these do seem like good marketing ideas. But as an analyst, I'm conflicted in terms of the financial impact. So I'm just kind of wondering, which department carries a bigger stick, for lack of a better term?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, that's like asking what's more important, your brain or your liver. You can't live without either one. So they're all important and they all really carry equal importance. And that's why I said I think the highest priority that we have at the company is to be safe and to be financially strong. So those are -- they're not mutually exclusive.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let me go at it about a slightly different way. Let's say your revenue management team, hypothetically, you see strength across the board in all markets and decides that demand could support higher fares. How does that process play out? What happens next? Do they walk into your office, Gary? Do they walk to the marketing department to get approval? Do they have a unilateral power to execute an increase on their own? I'm not asking you to comment on future pricing. I'm just curious when you've raise fares in the past, how does the process internally play out?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think, I'm the old CFO. But the -- there are companies that are famous in the country for having the finance department control the company. No, our commercial organization is led by Bob Jordan, and he is empowered to execute his plan.","Robert E. Jordan","No. We'll tell you, of course, when we have -- when we're working on new ideas, the A1 to A15, for example. We always have that vetted by our financial team. We are a team. We work together. But yes, the -- particularly on the commercial side, things are moving every single day, and we have to make a lot of judgments hour by hour as they come at us.","Tammy Romo","Jamie, we all sit very close to each other and we talk all the time. So we are -- we vet everything and we work very, very closely together.","Gary C. Kelly","I mean, the nice -- and I'm not sure exactly where you're angling, Jamie. So we may not be addressing the essence of your question. But the nice thing about this group is that they are a team. And they don't even think the way that you're asking the question. So it's -- we all share the same -- you will get the same answer from every person here when you talk about what we stand for, where we want the company to go, how -- what we're going to do to get there. It is a very tight team and we work extremely well together, and that's how we're going to win.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","When I look at your revenues over the last, say, 3 or 4 years, the real revenue increase that you've seen recently has been as a result of the AirTran merger. So could you talk a little bit about how you get to the next level? How you get the next -- well, you talked about your goal for the next $1.1 billion. But how do you go beyond that? Or is that it?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, maybe a contrast is helpful in answering the question. If I think about where we are compared to the competition, we're not dependent solely on fare increases from here. We have a number of opportunities to optimize the acquisition that we've been spending quite a bit of time talking about this morning. We have opportunities to enhance our revenue management. We're going to be bringing forward new technology with a reservation system, which has tremendous revenue-generating capabilities along with that. And we don't serve beyond the 48 states in any meaningful way. So we have opportunities to grow our loyalty, to grow the number of customers that we have and also to, obviously, grow the number of destinations that we serve. So we have enormous opportunities to grow revenues. It just has to be done in a way that also grows profits and at the right return level, so very different than our competitors. And we'll always have the ability to expand beyond North America later. But really, everything that we're talking about is within the reach of the 737 as well. So it's a very efficient way for us to expand.","Robert E. Jordan","Helane, the other way -- just to make the point, if you just look at what we've laid out for 2013, what we talked about at Analyst Day, for example, the addition of the O&D revenue management, the network changes to harvest aircraft out of block and turn these ancillary revenue ideas, continued increase on All-New Rapid Rewards, the addition of the seats to the Evolve and 800s, those are adding in 2013 on the order of $700 million to the revenue plan. So that is completely outside of the AirTran acquisition, for the most part. So I think if you just look at the plan for 2013, I think it proves that the -- the fact that there's a lot of opportunity.","Gary C. Kelly","And I guess just the last point to try to make here is, and I think it relates to several of the previous questions, that we are a brand. And it is firmly affixed in people's mind, and that is a good thing. But we are a low-fare, low-cost brand. And so in answering your question and others', what we are -- what we're determined to do is maintain that low-cost leadership so that we can maintain our low-fare leadership, and then it makes these things possible. If we're going to change our brand, then I think it changes the answer to your question entirely because I don't think we do have opportunities to grow revenues in a meaningful way, if we're going to become a high-cost, high-fare carrier. So it all has to start with who are you and what do you want to be. And I think so long as we're low cost and low fare, we have significant opportunities to grow revenues.","Operator","And we have time for one final question today, it is from Kevin Crissey with UBS.","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","If I just take your return on invested capital table and just simply do the math to get to 15%, if we double your operating income and don't change the invested capital base, you come out of it like 14.4%. So you need to do a little bit more than that. If we think about the mix between the denominator and the numerator, how much should we expect of it to be coming from the improved operating income versus the reduction in the invested capital, considering that your invested capital calculation is a 5 quarter average, it looks like?","Tammy Romo","Well, I think we have already shared with you, I've been pretty -- well, actually in great detail what our numerator, at least our planned numerator would be for the -- for ROIC calculation. So obviously, just mathematically, the rest would have to come from the invested capital base.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Brand for any additional and closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom, and thanks everyone from the analyst community for joining us today. Everyone, have a great day. Of course, if you have any additional questions, we are available this afternoon.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communications and Strategic Outreach.","Linda B. Rutherford","Hi, Tom. Thank you, and good morning. Everyone. If the media folks would queue up, then we will begin to take your questions. So Tom, if you could let them know how to do that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll begin with our first question from Terry Maxon with The Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxon","I'll have my usual parochial question. The -- your first gates at Dallas Love Field's new terminal open, I believe, in April for you, about 12 gates.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, sir.","Terry Maxon","In that interim, 18 months between the time that you can fly nonstop anywhere out of Dallas Love Field, how do you intend to use those 12 gates? Will you use them more intensely than you had at the -- at your old concourse and there's a period where you'll be using gates in both of them? Do you intend to step up your activity in the short term with the new gates? Will it allow you to do so?","Gary C. Kelly","I think, Terry, the way to think about 2013 is it's pretty much a continuation of what you've been seeing. So I don't think we'll have any major changes just because of the opening of the new airport. As we get closer, it's really more of a question about what are we going to do next year. And we're in the, I would say, early stages of debating what our options are there. A lot of it will have to do with, obviously, trade-offs throughout the rest of our system. But the -- and Ron Ricks is here. So I'll let him jump in. But we've opened the ticket counter space on November 1, as you well know. The concourse is on schedule to open. I believe it's 11 gates first, Ron, and there's a 12th that's added very quickly. I think there's some ramp or tarmac work that has to be completed. And we'll move the vast majority, the super majority of our flights over to the new terminals. So we're very excited about that. But that's just going to pick up Southwest as you know it today and move it over to some brand-spanking-new facilities.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Koenig with the Associated Press.","David Koenig","Gary, yesterday, Scott Kirby talked about the high load factors, and said they're offering a precursor to higher fares. He wasn't talking specifically, I don't think, about his airline. I wondered if you agree. And also whether further industry consolidation might increase momentum for higher fares?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think that the fares, at least from our perspective, are a function of cost. And we are finally in 2012 and 2013 getting adjusted to record energy prices. So to have crude oil in $112 a barrel and us talking about hitting our prosperity, a financial target is a pretty remarkable thing of -- for those of us who fought the battle here for the last decade to overcome fuel prices. So that's the main driver. As a practical matter, if the market can't absorb those charges, well then, you're kind of left with an unsuccessful business. So clearly, supply and demand and -- are key factors in any economic equation. And then of course, it ultimately is at what price. So if supplies stay the same and demand improves, clearly, there's an opportunity for pricing to strengthen. Load factors are one indication of that. But because we have such disparate travel habits between business travelers and consumers, that's not always a good indicator. But load factors, absolutely across the industry, are at record high levels. That does indicate, I think, pretty good health of the industry, certainly in relative terms to the prior years. And as I reported earlier, the industry, at least in the markets that we serve, is not growing capacity. So if the economy continues to improve and demand continues to improve, that would be a good healthy environment for everyone.","David Koenig","And then the consolidation part of that, would more consolidation increase that momentum?","Gary C. Kelly","It just depends on what is done in consolidation. If consolidation is 1 plus 1 is less than 2, then that means you're taking supply down. And yes, I think that, that would strengthen pricing, if that's what happens.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andy Compart with Aviation Week.","Andrew Compart","Gary, you said at the beginning of the analyst call that there are a number of markets not performing to Southwest's satisfaction, and you'd begin to address those gradually during this year.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, sir.","Andrew Compart","If you can elaborate on how you plan to address them? Are these markets that you're going to pull out of to change the pattern of service, change the frequencies? What's your thinking there?","Gary C. Kelly","Andy, I think it's all of the above. And in some cases, it may just be moving the flight times around a bit. One of the things that Mike Van de Ven and Bob Jordan are working jointly together on is to get more of our flights concentrated between 8 a.m. and, say, 7 p.m. And so there are -- if we can improve the efficiency of the aircraft scheduling during the day, there are opportunities to get more flights in that premium part of the day. So you -- we have obvious things like that, that we could do. But it could be that short-haul markets are a perfect example, Andy, where 10 years ago, we had far more frequencies in short-haul markets because there were far more travelers in those markets. So we've trimmed out frequencies, and I'm sure we'll continue to do some of that here in 2013. I hope what we have less of is eliminating nonstop service between city pairs. But again, in this environment where costs have gone up, fares have gone up and travel demand has gone down in certain markets, that is a possibility, too. But for the most part, it will be, and Bob mentioned this earlier, it's a matter of trying to improve the efficiency of the airline schedule and have better market timings for our flights.","Operator","And we have time for one final question today. It does come from Ghim-Lay Yeo with Flight Global.","Ghim-Lay Yeo","I just have 2 quick questions. The first is about the retirement of 737 Classic. I think it was Tammy who mentioned earlier on that you'll be retiring some aircraft this year. Are you able to elaborate on that, please? And I have a second question that's to clarify about your comments about Atlanta. You said that 2013 is going to be a big year for the airport. So does that mean you're looking at adding capacity back in the -- into the airport for the year ahead?","Tammy Romo","Yes. In terms of Classic retirements for 2013, we're expecting to retire about 13. But again, as I mentioned in my comments, just from an overall fleet perspective, we are expecting to maybe be down just slightly in terms of a number of aircraft.","Gary C. Kelly","And with respect to Atlanta, Bob, would you like to speak to that?","Robert E. Jordan","Oh, yes, sure. On Atlanta, it's really not a change in the number of flight, it's a change in the flight schedule, so, particularly post the codeshare implementation. We can really begin to optimize the combined AirTran and Southwest schedules, which of course, most of that flows through Atlanta. So you'll see, what I would call pretty substantial changes in the actual schedule. But not -- I would say not substantial changes in the number of flights in Atlanta between the 2 carriers.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing or additional remarks.","Linda B. Rutherford","Thanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us this morning.

My name is Abby, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Martinez - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Abby, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Tom Nealon, our President; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we get started, please note that our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections. A variety of factors could cause our actual results to be materially different from our current expectations. And we also make references to non-GAAP results, which exclude special items. And for more information regarding forward-looking statements and our reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP results, please visit our Investor Relations section of southwest.com, where you can find this morning's earnings release as well as our SEC filings.","And now I will turn the call over to Gary.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call.","First of all, I want to thank all of our employees for an excellent third quarter performance. It was a very nice recovery from the second quarter, which was down 3% on a RASM basis due to Flight 1380. And then that was a nice turnaround to the third quarter RASM performance of up 1.2%.","Mexico was weak for us in terms of revenue. But our domestic performance, excluding all the international, the domestic performance was a solid RASM of plus 2.3% year over year. And it is 2.9% if you adjust for stage and gauge increases. Overall, we had a sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement of 2 percentage points ahead of normal trends, so, again, it was a very nice recovery.","Our year-over-year comps always have noise in them but I'm expecting another sequential trend improvement in fourth quarter and then a year-over-year improvement as we said in the press release of 1% to 2%. So, again, that would be another nice better than trend, sequential improvement if we do that. Our unit cost ex-items will come in roughly flat to up 1% for the year-end for the fourth quarter for that matter but another excellent cost performance. We wanted to provide you an early look ahead to 2019.","Our confidence level forecasting revenues is never a 100%, of course, and especially looking a year out but our goal for next year right now is positive RASM and of at least 3%. And while it is a goal, trends and initiatives that we already have underway would support that goal.","Our confidence level in predicting cost is much higher of course than revenues. And based on the planning that's currently underway, the preliminary read is that unit cost ex-items will also be up at least 3%. I'm not satisfied with that as I'm sure our investors aren't either and Tammy will describe the cost pressures further. But I did want to provide some perspective first.","Just looking across the last decade plus, we've committed to strategic initiatives and invested accordingly. Some investments were revenue generating, some investments were capacity and growth related, some investments were efficiency related. But as a consequence of that strategy and those investments, the airline has been transformed and the cost during this intervening time period have been well controlled. And to do that, we've relied primarily on fleet modernization to accomplish that.","We have a stronger, much more prosperous, but a more complex airline. In some cases, there are costs associated with driving these higher revenues. But the main point that I want to make is that our focus with our strategic efforts has clearly been on transforming the airline and driving more revenue along with operational reliability and customer service. I'm very pleased with the results of all those efforts. The results must be sustained and continuously improved from here.","But eventually, I think all of us at Southwest knew that the time would come where our initiatives would need to zero in on efficiency and productivity and just overall cost control. And clearly that time has arrived and cost will be our number one priority. So the basic inflationary themes that Tammy is going to talk about we constantly battle. We're investing in airport infrastructure. We're investing in technology initiatives and projects. Aircraft maintenance is an ever-increasing burden. And then there is just natural salaries, wages and benefits inflation.","So the opportunities to offset that natural inflation are what you would expect lies in modernizing our fleet, just overall quality of our flight schedule, continuing to drive operational efficiency, controlling our G&A spending. And then, from there of course we just rely on individual department missions.","So for 2019, at this preliminary juncture while we're seeing the known cost pressures, we aren't yet seeing the productivity offsets. There are offsets in fuel because of fuel efficiency which of course aren't showing up in the cost ex-fuel items. But we're not seeing enough productivity offsets yet.","So speaking plainly, it will take more focus on our part and more effort on our part to make that happen. And as I've already said that's where our focus will be and we may have to de-prioritize some other yearned for things that we have in the meantime.","I'll also point out that many of our efficiencies are already underway. Again, we'll show up in jet fuel consumption. And we'll need to clearly identify that for you as offsets in the future. So we have a challenge. And we always do by the way. We always have challenges. We're very well prepared and very well positioned.","Number one, we have a very strong balance sheet with declining leverage and it's below 30%. We have very strong liquidity with cash levels well ahead of our target. We just reported record earnings for the quarter. And barring the unforeseen, we expect very strong year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter. We have an outstanding fuel hedge that's built for the next 24 months. We have very manageable growth plans for 2019. And in fact, we need growth to absorb investments that were made related to capacity like airports and training facilities.","Our operations are excellent. Our brand and our customer ratings are very high and industry-leading. Our culture of course is unmatched, and our ability to attract talented people in this falling employment (sic) [unemployment] environment is very strong.","And then finally and I think most importantly, we have a low-cost DNA. We have a proven track record of managing not just cost, but industry-leading profits and margins and returns. And in the meantime, again assuming nothing unforeseen, we will continue our focus on excellent shareholder returns.","So with that hopefully helpful perspective, let me just turn the call over to Tom Nealon to take us through the commercial side here.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thank you, Gary. Good morning everybody.","As Gary said, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance and we are seeing continued strength into the fourth quarter in terms of passenger demand throughout the booking curve as well as continued strength in the pricing environments and very solid yield momentum, so we're very pleased with that.","Before getting into the fourth quarter, let me walk you through the performance indicators of the third quarter. I'll try and tie that back to my comments in the July call. So as you know, we ended the third quarter with a record $5.6 billion in operating revenues, which is up about 5% year over year. And our passenger yields increased 2.3% for the quarter. So again, we were very pleased with that.","Our load factor was 83.9%, which was down about 1 point year over year. But we actually saw passenger growth of 2.5% for the quarter, and we carried a record 33.9 million passengers in the third quarter. So we're very pleased with the strength of passenger demand as well as the strength in the pricing environment, and I think our teams did a phenomenal job of balancing our yields and load factors for a very well-balanced strong result. So that's all good.","I shared with you all in July going into the quarter we knew that we had three RASM headwinds, which all together were a 2 point drag on Q3 RASM. First, we had the Rapid Rewards accounting change, which was 1 point. Second, we had about 0.5 point of drag from our summer fare sale, which was part of our 1380 recovery as you'll recall. And third, we expect about 0.5 point of drag resulting from the suboptimal schedule, which is tied to the shoulder flying and the fleet retirement and such. These headwinds materialized as we expected in the third quarter, which again was 2 points of RASM headwinds. And also, as expected, we do not see them repeating in the fourth quarter.","In our mid-September update, we made a positive revision to our Q3 RASM outlook, an outlook of roughly flat to RASM increasing in the 1% to 1.5% range. Our third quarter RASM came in right in line with our latest guidance, and we finished the quarter up 1.2% year over year. And there were really two primary drivers of our improved Q3 RASM result compared to our original guidance in July.","So first, we had about 2,200 total flight cancellations due to weather during the quarter, and that resulted in about 0.5 point of RASM benefit for the quarter. The weather events were primarily severe storms in late July and early August, and it was very concentrated in Denver and Baltimore, where we obviously have very large, very complex operations, so that was significant. Conversely, though, we only saw a few hundred cancellations due to Hurricane Florence, and the RASM impact of Florence was really immaterial for us.","Second and more importantly and more interesting, we saw strong improvements in our passenger yield trends, in particular with close-in bookings, which resulted in a little more than 0.5 point benefit to third quarter RASM.","Our new revenue management tools and techniques also contributed to our yield performance and solid RASM results. So for the third quarter, we realized an EBIT benefit of approximately $75 million, which was right in line with our expectations, which is roughly a 1.5 point benefit to third quarter RASM. Now, this benefit was driven primarily by our new O&D revenue management capabilities, but we also saw meaningful benefit from our new pricing capabilities as well. So we are very happy, very, very happy with the performance of our new res system and revenue management capabilities, and we are achieving the benefits that we signed up for and committed to.","So in terms of our ancillary revenue performance, we had another really good quarter. As I'm sure you saw in late August, we introduced a new pricing structure for our EarlyBird product, where we moved from a fixed $15 one-way price point to price points of $15, $20, and $25, and the price points are based on a combination of length of haul and EarlyBird demand by market. So it's still early, but so far we've been very pleased with the results. The take rates are right in line with our expectations, which not only results in incremental revenue, but it also allows us to better manage the number of priority boarding positions sold on each flight, which makes the product that much more valuable to our customers.","Our Rapid Rewards Program, it continues to strengthen and grow, as well as our business partner revenues, and these categories were again the primary drivers of the 6.6% growth in other revenues in Q3.","We are continuing to see strong growth in new Rapid Rewards credit card members as well as strength in credit card spending, both of which were up again double digits year over year. And while it's early, our new credit card, which launched in Q3, is also performing very well, and it's also in line with our expectations.","So net of all this is that we had a very strong third quarter. We are very pleased with how our new tools and our new products are performing.","Now, let's move on to the fourth quarter. Looking forward, as I said earlier, we are seeing continued revenue strength into the fourth quarter. Our year-over-year capacity growth is planned in the 6% to 6.5% range, which is 2.5 points higher than in Q3. And despite that, we are in fact expecting a sequential improvement in our year-over-year RASM performance in Q4, as Gary said. As I mentioned, I think we'll have a clean year-over-year RASM comparison.","So based on our current bookings and yield trends, we expect Q4 RASM to increase in the range of 1% to 2% year over year. Our base business trends continue to be very strong throughout the booking curve. Our passenger yield expectations are, once again, being aided by benefits from O&D revenue management and our new pricing capabilities. And based on the bookings so far, fourth quarter demand appears to be very, very solid and holding up very nicely. So again, we do expect to see some load factor decline, but the net effect should continue to be a positive for RASM performance.","We do expect a year-over-year EBIT benefit of $80 million to $90 million in Q4 from our new res system, which gets us to an estimated 1.5 point benefit to Q4 RASM. And that puts us right in line with our annual 2018 EBIT goal of $200 million from our new res system.","I'll tell you, I'm very proud of how our revenue management capabilities were delivered on time and on plan. They are working exactly as they were designed. I think the commercial and technology teams did an awesome job. I couldn't be more proud and more pleased and more thankful with the quality of the execution and the results.","So in terms of our shoulder flying, as expected, we began to reduce our shoulder flying beginning in Q3, and the reduction continues into Q4. In particular, we did reduce our deep shoulder flying, and this is flying before 6:00 AM and after 10:00 PM, just as a reminder. And with this reduction in deep shoulder flying, we are not seeing a RASM drag in Q4 from our schedule, and we expect deep shoulder flying to subside further as we move into 2019.","So to wrap it up, I am very pleased with the trends that we're seeing in the back half of 2018. And as Gary said, barring any unforeseen events, this sets us up very well and very nicely as we head into 2019. And finally, we are very, very anxious, very eager for our upcoming launch to Hawaii. And we are ready to go with our flight schedules once we receive the necessary approvals.","So with that, I will turn it over to Mike Van de Ven for our operations update.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon to some of you all and morning to others.","As you guys know, the third quarter is a transition period for the operation, and we began the quarter with very heavy summer flying. We had just over 4,000 flights a day at the beginning of the quarter, and we ended up in late August and September timeframe with just under that amount.","And the operation is often impacted in this period by a combination of high load factors and weather, and this year just wasn't any different. We had a tough last half of July and early August with 2,200 weather-related cancellations as Tom mentioned. In addition to those cancellations, though, we experienced more weather-related ATC\/Block delays this July than we had in any July over the last 10 years.","So despite that difficult environment, our people were just, they were magnificent. And I think we delivered superb operational performance for the quarter. We expect to finish fourth in the DoT on-time performance for the quarter, and that's based on our marketing carrier results. And that's an improvement of three spots over last year.","We set a third quarter record for the lowest percentage of mishandled bags in our history. And our DoT complaints that have been reported through August were at 5-year lows and are down 24.5% from last year. And just as a reminder we were number one in the industry last year.","In our fuel efficiency, as Gary mentioned, continues to grow in terms of the ASMs we produced per gallon. And we're improving at about 1.1%. And again that's primarily as a result of our fleet modernization efforts. So we've had very strong operational results in terms of reliability and hospitality. I think that will continue into the fourth quarter. And we're going to spend more time, as Gary mentioned, focusing towards our efficiency and cost opportunities as we move forward.","A couple other highlights in the third quarter, we announced that we are partnering with the State of Maryland to build a maintenance hangar in Baltimore. That's going to house three Boeing 737s inside the hangar and will also provide us with additional parking spots of up to eight airplanes overnight. That's our first hangar in the Northeast and it's really a needed addition to one of our busiest cities.","We've also previously announced our intent to add both a pilot and a flight attendant crew base in Los Angeles and those will be open and up here in December and the first part of next year. And that will in part support our Hawaii efforts. And then speaking of Hawaii, it's our expansion focus for next year. And just subject to the timing of our ETOPS certification from the FAA, our goal continues still to be to sell tickets at the end of this year and operate flights early next year.","So, with that brief update, Tammy, I think I'll just turn it over to you.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Right. Thank you, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.","Moving right into cost, our third quarter CASM, excluding special items, increased 4.1% year over year, driven in part by a nearly 9% increase in our hedged fuel costs. Our hedged fuel price per gallon remains steady at $2.25 and that's despite an increase in market jet fuel prices during the quarter.","Our hedged jet fuel remains in line with our guidance due to more material hedging gains that kicked in at higher prices. The $0.04 net hedge benefit consisted of $0.10 of hedging gains offset by $0.06 of premium costs.","For fourth quarter and based on market prices last Friday and given our hedging positions, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.30 to $2.35 range. This guidance includes an estimated $0.07 net hedging benefit including $0.14 of hedging gains offset by $0.07 of premium costs. The $0.10 sequential increase in our estimated fourth quarter fuel price normalizing for the hedging gains is largely due to the increase in market prices.","For 2019, we are also well prepared with a 63% hedge in protection beginning at $70 Brent crude equivalent with more material gains that kick in at $80 per barrel and continue to increase well above $100 per barrel.","Our 2019 hedges are a mix of WTI and Brent crude oil and are structured so that we fully participate in market price decline. For full year 2019 based on market prices last Friday and our current hedging positions, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.35 to $2.40 range with an estimated $0.08 hedging gain and $0.04 premium cost. We expect 2019 fuel hedge premium costs, which is included in fuel and oil expense to be approximately $80 million or $0.04 per gallon and down from this year.","As Mike said, we continue to benefit from increased fuel efficiency from our fleet modernization. Our third quarter available seat mile per gallon, which is our key fuel efficiency metric improved by 1.1% year over year.","As I mentioned last quarter, our fuel efficiency improvement is slightly behind our 2018 goal of 2% to 3% primarily due to our utilization of the -700 fleet to cover our fleet deficit and suboptimal flight schedule. As our schedule becomes more optimized and as we take on more MAX aircraft and began the retirement cycle of the 700, we expect the fuel efficiency profile of our fleet to continue to improve. In fact, I expect sequential improvement in our fourth quarter year-over-year fuel efficiency more in line with what we were expecting for the full year.","I'm going to move on to third and fourth quarter our non-fuel costs and I'll talk in more detail about 2019 at the end of my prepared remarks. When you strip out fuel profit sharing and special items, our unit cost inflation in the third quarter was in line with our expectations. As we previously disclosed in our investor update our third quarter unit costs were impacted by weather-related flight cancellations, resulting in about 1 point reduction in ASM.","When combined with modest weather-related costs, the flight cancellations resulted in a nearly 1 point year-over-year negative impact to CASM. We ended up at the lower end of our CASM guidance, primarily due to approximately $10 million of spending that shifted into the fourth quarter and beyond. The shifts are primarily due to the timing of maintenance events and technology spending. Aside from shifting, the other cost categories were pretty much in line with expectations.","Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM outlook looks good, particularly from the easier comparisons that we had with last year's tax reform year-end bonus. Despite some cost pressure from shifting of spend out of the first half and third quarter, fourth quarter year-over-year CASM excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing is expected to be flat to up 1%. We've also had some capacity cuts here in fourth quarter, so we do have some related cost pressures. Netting out the moving parts, our full year 2018 CASM excluding fuel, profit sharing and special items remains unchanged.","Our balance sheet remains very strong and investment-grade credit rating and with ample liquidity and we also have very healthy cash flows. Our year-to-date operating cash flow was $3.9 billion. We've invested $1.4 billion back into the business thus far in 2018. And for full year 2018 CapEx, we continue to expect to be in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range. And we are planning for a similar level of CapEx for 2019.","So far in 2018, we've returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $332 million in dividends. This includes the $500 million accelerated share repurchase we launched in the third quarter and just completed earlier this month. This most recent ASR completed our previous $2 billion share repurchase authorization and the first $150 million from our new $2 billion authorization. So we have $1.85 billion remaining.","Over the past five years we've returned nearly all of our free cash flow through share repurchases and dividends, supporting our commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders. So, overall I'm very pleased with our continued approach to capital deployment with appropriate balance. We intend to continue investing back in the business while focusing on opportunities to drive further value, and we continue to have great opportunities to do so in particular with further investments in fleet modernization. Barring unforeseen circumstances, we also intend to continue returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends with our excess cash.","Regarding our fleet plan, we made some slight tweaks to our order book recently. First as planned, we took delivery of five Boeing 737-800 aircraft and seven MAX 8s in the quarter and we continue to expect to end the year with 751 aircraft.","During third quarter, we signed leases on an additional four MAX 8 aircraft with delivery in 2019. We still have 27 firm orders with Boeing for 737 MAX 7 and MAX 8 aircraft next year. And now we have 7 leased MAX 8s coming next year as well for a total of 34 aircraft in 2019.","As we've previously shared, we're planning to designate some of our 737-700 aircraft for retirement next year to support our continued investment in fleet modernization. These additional aircraft acquisitions or any future opportunities to pick up a few additional new aircraft for fleet replacement do not change our previously communicated 2019 capacity plan.","On the capacity side with the storm cancellations in the third quarter, we are now planning for our 2018 capacity to increase approximately 4% with fourth quarter ASMs up in the 6% to 6.5% range year over year. And we continue to plan for 2019 capacity to increase no more than 5% year over year, which is unchanged.","Our schedule is currently published through early June 2019 and they exclude expected Hawaii flying. You can see that excluding Hawaii our January through May year-over-year ASM growth is modest.","In regards to 2019 cost, and as Gary mentioned, we are expecting full year 2019 CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase at least 3% year over year. The key drivers of our year-over-year unit cost pressures in 2019 are primarily due to operations, staffing demand and healthcare inflation, which is driving an increase in salary, wages and benefits. Increased maintenance expense driven in part by expected timing of maintenance events. Airport cost increase is driven in part by airport infrastructure investments and continued heavy investments in technology focused primarily on operational investments.","Much of the cost inflation we are seeing here in the second half 2018 is continuing into next year. Of course, I'm adjusting our current fourth quarter 2018 unit cost trends for higher fourth quarter capacity growth as well as fourth quarter 2017's tax reform employee bonus and charitable contribution, which was about 3 points to fourth quarter 2017. So our current growth rate continues into next year and we will shift our number one focus to control cost in 2019 to arrest that trend.","In closing, we had an excellent third quarter and we were able to expand our net margin and deliver record third quarter earnings per share. These are notable achievements in the industry and I'd like to thank our more than 58,000 employees for their outstanding efforts.","I am very pleased with our rebound in revenue trends in third quarter and our continued momentum thus far in fourth quarter. Our fuel hedging gains have offset a significant portion of higher market jet fuel prices so far this year and will continue to provide protection, especially if prices continue to rise. While we face some unit cost inflation next year, I believe we have great opportunities ahead of us to more efficiently scale our growth and drive further productivity and efficiencies and this will be a primary focus for us next year.","We strive to continue delivering very healthy margins, as we continue to invest in our future. We continue to deliver high returns on invested capital and that will remain a top priority.","With that Abby, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin with our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, Gary, let me start with the revenue question, if I could. And I appreciate your willingness to provide some initial thoughts on RASM growth next year. I guess as we sort of do the math for 2019 to get to margin expansion, you will need to see at least 3.5% RASM growth or so. Could you kind of talk through some of the specific initiatives on the revenue side that you think will help get you there? And I would just be curious to know your level of conviction behind the ability to drive margin expansion next year?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, obviously, great question Jack. I think we're very motivated. And I admitted in my opening remarks that the confidence level we have with revenue forecast 15 months from now or 14 months from now can't be that high relative to our confidence level on the cost side of things. So we admit that going in. Revenues can be tough to predict.","And I think just couching it in those terms based on what we see right now and based on the plans that are already underway we're very convicted to that. So, Tom, is here and leads our commercial organization along with Andrew Watterson and Ryan Green and we're well along in our planning for 2019.","The specifics are pretty much what you know. And I thought Tom was very clear in his report that we had a plan for 2018. We're delivering against that plan remarkably well, remarkably accurately, I guess, I can say. And we're looking forward to the full year benefit of many of those things for 2019. And so if you like Tom can sort of renumerate what those are.","In terms of new revenue streams for 2019, we don't have anything to report there today. I did tease last time that we are busy working on the next stream of initiatives. And it will be next year before we're ready to talk about those. So you'll have to stay tuned on that. And Tom as I'm thinking out loud, I don't know that anything new will necessarily come online in 2019.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I think what we're seeing is the ancillary products are growing in a pace faster than our core business and our credit card business is very, very strong and such. I think it starts with just the close-in current environment is very, very strong and I think that one of our areas of focus is just that just focus, focus, execute and drive that into 2019.","And I think what we're seeing is the initiatives are paying off. I think that our One Res initiative whether it's O&D bid pricing or the pricing capabilities, the credit cards, the ancillary, these things are paying off. We're seeing real strength in our corporate sales business. That's a really bright spot for us. And I think when you look at some of this more broad-based of our key focus cities, there's just real economic strength and the performance is outstanding. So we got our work in front of us but I feel very, very good about what we know at this point.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I think, said just a little different way, based on what our plan is for 2019 we're not depending on new things that we have no experience with. Now, from a macro perspective, it's not necessarily trying to give you a read on what we think about the economy next year. If you'll just forgive that, I mean, our guess is as good as yours I suppose. But we're not assuming any change in the economy and broader industry demand.","As we look at the industry macro levers, supply and demand, I think are in pretty nice balance right now, and I don't think that that will get out of balance next year. But it's a pretty strong environment right now, and I think we have some easier comps, to be blunt, in the first half of next year. That was pointed out by one of your colleagues last time, and we fully acknowledge that. So that's a factor, but it makes the at least 3% RASM growth I think a very viable goal.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Okay, great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly in your prepared remarks, the 3% \u2013 I guess at least 3% CASM ex-growth for next year doesn't include any of the efficiencies that you guys are trying to zero in on now. First of all, is that correct? And I guess is there the potential that you can maybe offset some of those inflationary costs that Tammy laid out in her comments with some efficiencies that you can maybe come back to us with later on?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","That is correct. And based on what we know right now, I don't think we're willing to commit to anything different than what we've said. Now clearly Jack, we'll be working very hard on this, and we'll owe you and the world an update on our progress, and I would say, Ryan, in 60 days. I'll leave it up to Investor Relations exactly what we'll do next. But we're not done with our 2019 plan and I haven't done this for a long time with you all. I don't remember a time where we ever gave you this much advance insight into the following year.","But this one was different enough that quite frankly we felt the obligation for full disclosure here. So this is where we are. I'm not going to say I don't like it because I'm just not satisfied with it. And I think I was also trying to articulate for everyone the perspective that wow, our folks are doing a really good job on so many other dimensions. It's hard to say that you don't like it. But clearly, it's a result that we can't be satisfied with. We need to be a low-cost producer. And if anything, our goal is to drive our unit cost down and not up and certainly up that much.","So I gave you an array of things at least to give you some insight as to what we would be attacking here. And I'm going to ask \u2013 I've already had a number of volunteers to take on the new initiatives here, and Tom and Mike will head that up. And I'll be asking them to devote a significant amount of their time to these efforts.","The balance or the trick here is to keep everything in balance. So we don't want to chase this challenge and all of a sudden let our on-time performance degrade our customer service. And that's why I think the perspective and the balance is correct. So we'll want to make some smart decisions here. But clearly, we can't be satisfied with that kind of unit cost inflation, and we're not.","Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, great. Gary, thanks again for the time.","Operator","We will take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, a couple of questions, not surprisingly I guess on the unit cost side, Gary, Tammy. So I guess first in terms of the 2019 guide and that 3% number, it seems like that may be an up around just given some of the initiatives that you're going to push out there, Gary, in terms of an opportunity? That's one.","And then the second part of it is, as you think about unit cost over the next few years, is 2019 now going to be an anomaly, or should we think of Southwest as now having higher costs over the next few years? Because, Gary, you did make some comments about Southwest being transformed versus its history and that sort of a thing. So I wasn't sure as to what you were trying to message there.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I was just \u2013 and thanks for that question. It's another really good one. Because I do want to be as clear, and I know Tammy does too, as we can on where we are for 2019. It was really just a perspective that a lot of investment and initiatives have occurred over the last decade.","Our load factor, Mike, I'm going to have to guess off the top of my head a decade ago was 10 points lower. So some of the cost that we're incurring today as compared to 2008 are simply because we have a lot more customers per departure. We have a lot more bags. And so some of these cost increases, in other words, are acceptable to me, if you want to describe it that way.","There's a lot more to it than that, but most of our transformational efforts were geared towards driving more revenue, and we have been very, very successful with that. We had a huge investment in a new frequent flyer program, ultimately followed on by a huge investment in a new reservation system. And, Tom, as far as I know, the reservation system, which is very valuable, only increases our unit cost. So it is significantly more costly than what we had before. But the business case is really solid. It's just paid for on the revenue side. So that's all I meant there.","And then just admitting to you and everyone that for us to manage our cost more aggressively, it's just going to have to take the higher priority and just a lot more elbow grease, because the cost \u2013 we are optimizing our schedule, but what we are not realizing is the cost efficiencies that go along with that. And we're going to have to work hard to achieve that.","So the other thing I would speak to is \u2013 I was very careful with the words. What we are telling you is we're looking at least 3%. So I'm not ready to provide any more information than that because that is all I feel like we can accurately tell you at this point. So that's really the report today. And then as we finish up our planning and as we do identify and commit to some initiatives here, we'll have a much better number. Again, I'll defer to Investor Relations over the next 60 to 90 days, and we'll update you there. So hopefully that answers your question.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It does. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you very much. Hey, good morning everybody. Gary, you mentioned obviously the initiative to drive productivity, but you also said that you may have to de-prioritize certain other things to drive that productivity. What were you talking about?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, nothing specific, Hunter. It was just acknowledging that a company or its leaders or its people can only do so many things at one time. We've got a really good multiyear program planned in terms of strategic initiatives. A lot of it involves technology construction.","And at least for this era, for Southwest, a lot of it involves new technology or replacement technology for Mike Van de Ven and our operations team. So we've starved them a little bit over the last decade because again our focus was more on the commercial side.","So it's simply to admit that if we're going to have a major cost initiative or two or three or four, something may have to give. And I don't have anything specific in mind, but my colleagues will confirm. I've been worried for some time that, as usual, we have more things that we want to do than we have capacity to complete. So something may have to give there.","So it's just \u2013 if you were to come back and ask the uninformed question of how are you going to fit these things in, I think that that's part of what we have to figure out here over the next 60 days is what might make sense. And of course, none of our leaders want to give up on anything because they're all individually very good ideas. So, it's not necessarily to warn you, it is basically just to say that's where we are in this task that we're going to have to crowbar it in on our to-do list here somehow and it's got to bear fruit.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just a modeling question. I believe you guys accrue for the mechanics deal, but obviously they rejected the deal. I'm not asking you to tell me where you are in those negotiations, but can you just help us know \u2013 help us understand how much of that accrual was in the 2018 CASM? Is that hitting the 2019 CASM number, any color you can provide there? Thanks, I appreciate it.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure, I'm happy to take that. Yes, we've incorporated all of our any anticipated rate increases, our agreements into the guidance that we provided this morning. So you've got all of that baked in, which I would point out based on what I've read from some of the other carriers, I noticed that not all the carriers have incorporated that into their guidance. So, what we've given you is fully loaded with our expectations.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon. Just a question maybe on the cost side, but on the holistic view here, if I look at pre-tax margin, it's down about 2 points year-over-year, down about 4 points versus kind of the peak which is a low fuel price environment. Given kind of this \u2013 assuming the current conditions continue, no change in the environment, how long do you think it takes to recapture or get back to maybe even last year's pre-tax margins?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Savi, I feel like we have really recaptured our fuel cost increase here. We've got a nice hedge that's mitigating that and that's properly covering 25% or so of the \u2013 if you compare our hedge versus the increase in market prices I feel like we're recovering a nice chunk of that just from our fuel hedge. And of course from a revenue perspective we're performing well there. So to deliver this quarter margin expansion we're really proud of that. So we feel like we have largely recovered that.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Tammy, I think you're talking about net income and I'm talking about pre-tax. And it's not like we're going to...","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes, excuse me. On a pre-tax margin, I think that goes back to just our earlier discussion on the cost, Savi. We're going to have to work through that here in our planning process to offset some of the headwinds. But we delivered on all of our guidance here in the third quarter. And, again, we're kind of focused on the pre-tax margin and again delivered on a very solid margin both operating and on a pre-tax basis. So we'll keep working at that. But pre-tax and after-tax, we feel like we're largely recovering that to the bottom-line.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Let me see if this is in line with what you're asking. The goal is to \u2013 I think there's \u2013 it's sort of multifaceted. But every year we have a goal to grow our unit revenues. And then I would say from that we have a goal to hit an overall return on invested capital target, which we well exceeded that for a handful of years here. But that is always a goal year-in, year-out. So then within that there would always be a goal to grow earnings and at least sustain if not grow margins. The tax savings is real.","So, I don't \u2013 it's a little hard and I would debate this with you Savi, it's a little hard to think about pre-tax margins today compared to a period where tax rates were higher because there is some interchange between the tax savings and pre-tax margins. They haven't been competed away at Southwest, but hopefully you get the point there. It's just not \u2013 it doesn't all just drop to the bottom line over a period of time.","But the main point here in the near term with the early guidance that we're giving you for 2019 is that our goal is to at least sustain and hopefully grow our margins for next year. And it doesn't matter of course in that sense whether you're talking about pre or post-tax. But in terms of trying to \u2013 I don't think we have gone back and took a prior year margin and said how will that compare to 2019 or 2020 or 2021. We just haven't done that. And in fairness to Tammy's answer. So what we are focused on is \u2013 just so again everybody is clear, we had a really good plan for the third quarter and we executed. Now we have a really good plan for the fourth quarter and we're going to focus on executing that.","And in the meantime we're going to finish our plans for 2019 with elements that aren't satisfactory to us and then come back with a firm plan for 2019 that we will give you again a lot more update and insight into.","But at least preliminarily those are our goals and right now they don't seem unachievable. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and finalizing our plan. And again there's more information to come on that.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. If I might just quickly ask a modeling question from Tammy. Just the $521 million in free market value in 2019-plus could you give me that like 2019 and 2020, the breakdown of that?","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yes. It's \u2013 yes. For 2019, it's roughly $270 million. And I'll share 2020 that's about $175 million.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, great. Thank you, both.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey! Good morning, everybody. And Gary, just on this cost issue the challenge that I'm having is really gauging the urgency around the topic, and I think, it's pretty high.","But your response earlier to Jack's question suggested that you'd plan to use the current toolbox to extract sufficient revenue as to ensure margin growth. I guess my question is if that toolbox is inadequate for whatever reason, how willing are you to think outside the box?","And look I don't even know how to define that. Maybe offering a higher fare that would guarantee a seat in the first three rows. I suppose at the very extreme it extends to M&A.","I don't \u2013 that's up to you. I understand your earlier comment was that you didn't have to plan anything new. My question is have you ruled out that possibility of doing something there?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I love the question and especially the opportunity to try to clarify that. Oh! Yeah, we will absolutely need to continue to innovate and challenge ourselves and think about ways to bring on new revenue streams.","That work is already underway. At least with the way we were coming into the planning season here for 2019, I wasn't thinking that we would want to attempt to deploy anything new in a more urgent way along the way you've asked the question.","I think, it's very reasonable...","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","...you asked your question that way, and so I would agree with you that that would be a consideration.","Now some of the things that we haven't shared with you have a build to them. And there we \u2013 we can't turn them on January 1 to be fair to the things that we do have in our minds that we want to pursue.","That doesn't include the other kinds of things that we might dream up that say you know what we need to do this and we are going to do it January 1. So all of that is in play. I'm very glad you asked the question.","The main focus I want to have though is on the cost side of things. And I have always had in my mind that at some point it will need to be a higher priority. And as I pointed out in my remarks the time is now.","We are not seeing the kinds of efficiencies here as we begin to trim the schedule back that I was counting on and so we're just going to have to work that much harder to do that.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very helpful, Gary. And second, with Hawaiian yields under pressure at the moment, I'm just curious if internally you've downwardly revised your forecast in response to that.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","No. Okay. We feel very good about Hawaii, and the work. I think, Tom and Mike, both commented on the status of that work there. So...","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","We will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey. Thanks. Gary, the press release reads like all of the 2019 cost increase is discretionary. Can you segment for us how much of the three points is inflation versus investments you are electing to make?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, I may have to go back and reread it and reflect on your interpretation there. But, Tammy, you can help me explain here. I think the...","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","...part of what we were \u2013 and I think, Tammy and I have both covered it. But just to make sure we've been clear, there are known cost increases coming into 2019. So, we've been spending money on airports.","Mike retired the classics and bought new airplanes to replace those. So there are line items that will see cost increases. We know about that. And that's what I was trying to point out. Those investments have been made. We've implemented a new reservation system. That depreciation is flowing through on and on. So those things are known.","The airline also has not in many cases added enough capacity yet to absorb some of these step increases and investments. Some of them are very, very fixed. And as time goes by, you will see unit cost declines, and of course, I know you can imagine what those are. So the opportunities for us are \u2013 they're classic opportunities. It is our corporate overhead, which is much more discretionary than having \u2013 as compared to frontline operations.","But operations is key here. It's having a very high-quality schedule that Mike delivers really good on on-time performance that helps keep cost down. And then, we just need to turn airplanes efficiently. We need to have efficient en route times. All of those things combined to produce very efficient and low-cost operations, which we're famous for. So, there's always opportunities to go in and fix things.","And again the challenge for us is to make sure that we don't make changes that mess something else up unintentionally. So we've got a very good schedule right now. And just thinking about 2019, we're very enthused about its revenue producing capabilities. It may be a little harder for Mike to staff it and to operate it, and so we just want to again try to keep these in balance, so there are things that our commercial team can do to perhaps make it easier on the operation from a staffing perspective.","And a classic example would be we have a lot of originating flights early in the morning at an airport and then nothing for them to do all day long until the airport goes to sleep. That may be great for revenue, but it's not the most efficient from operating the airport just to give you some color into what we mean. And we'll be pursuing all of those opportunities and our folks already have a plethora of ideas to pursue.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","That's helpful color. And then just to follow-up, why would IT drive operating expense? Is it just depreciation? I thought there was a big training investment that was going to kind of roll off as these systems mature.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, there is \u2013 if you just think about the reservation system and we've shared that cost $500 million many, many times, not all of that got capitalized and not all of that flows through over time through depreciation expense. And it is beyond me to explain to you those rules on which one is which. But in \u2013 while we are currently working on developing a lot of technology for our operations team as an example, there is \u2013 I'm searching for the right word.","Our costs do balloon as all this work is underway. We need extra help. And sometimes it shows up in consulting and professional services, maybe some other software firms or whatever it might be. And it also flows through the business side. So these technology projects are wonderful, but they are very expensive. And so not all of that \u2013 Tammy off the top of your head I don't know if you have a rule of thumb. But it's \u2013 I mean, it's not even 50% capitalized.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. It's 60%.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","It is 60%.","Tammy Romo - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah. And just to add to \u2013 just to help you out where some of these pressures are going to manifest in the P&L, certainly we do expect some headwinds in our depreciation. And that is from the investments in the technologies that we've been making here. So you'll see some \u2013 we'll see some headwinds there in depreciation and amortization related specifically to the technologies.","And then of course salary, wages and benefits is where you'll see some pressure as well on a unit cost basis year over year as we work to absorb some of the investments that we've made here over the past number of years. So \u2013 and I would expect salary, wages and benefits to be the most significant driver of our unit cost pressure next year. So \u2013 and some of that will fall out in other as well. So we don't \u2013 again we're \u2013 I'm not ready to give specific line item guidance today because we're still working our way through the plan, but at least directionally that will \u2013 can maybe help you with your modeling.","And then just another thought that I had as Gary was talking just as we look ahead to 2019 and just thinking about some of the inefficiencies that we've at least talked about, we'll \u2013 and as we grow into that we would expect to absorb some of that. But our \u2013 just one note on our 2019 ASM guidance of no more than 5%, as I mentioned that does include Hawaii flying. And that's estimated to be about half or so I mean of our planned year-over-year growth.","And you \u2013 and I know a lot of you look at our \u2013 follow the Diio schedules. If you look out at Diio, you can see that our capacity without Hawaii is quite modest. And I think they're trending in the 1% to 3% range without that Hawaii flying.","So we're anxious to start our Hawaii flying and ramp up our schedule there. So hopefully that provides a little more color as you're trying to complete your models there.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And Duane, you remind me of an earlier question that I don't think I ever answered. I know we're over our time. So I'll try to be quick year. But there was a question about whether or not this was sort of a transitional year and the inflation goes away post 2019.","And that may very well be. I don't think we are prepared to give you an answer on that yet because obviously the 2019 information is important to you and is new information.","And we want \u2013 I want us to be comfortable that whatever we tell you that will happen next that we've done enough work to be able to support that. But I do think that that's a reasonable thought that this is somewhat transitional. But we need to be comfortable with that.","Obviously, we do long-range plans. But the longer they are the less certain we are that they are realistic. So we'll want to revisit those longer-term plans now that 2019 has come more into focus before we answer that question.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay, thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And, Ryan, I think we'll give it back to you. I beg your pardon, one more question.","Operator","We have time for one more question. And we will take our last question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. It looks like the pressure is really on. So I just have a question actually as you think about Hawaii service for next year. When we're looking at the bookings for that, when you start to look at bookings for that, what are you thinking about in terms of redeemed Rapid Rewards versus people actually paying for those flights? Because I would imagine a lot of your customers are chomping at the bit to start booking and are saving up Rapid Rewards for exactly that.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I don't know, I'll let Tom guess on this too. And maybe Tom and Andrew have some sense of what other airlines see. We have a different frequent flyer program. Every seat every day is available for redemption, and it's de facto revenue managed. It takes more points to make a booking the week of travel than it does to get an advance purchase ticket. So there are natural revenue management controls over that.","But I think they would also tell you that we're really indifferent where those awards get used. The accounting has changed, so that the revenue recognition doesn't penalize that. So in other words, you won't see it. And our assumption is our customers earned these points and they're going to fly them somewhere. If they want to fly to Hawaii or they want to fly to Amarillo, it's all good by me.","But I can't imagine a scenario like the old days, people were worried about we're going to fill this whole airplane up with zero paying frequent flyers. I can't imagine that scenario. But if it happens that way, you still won't see a problem.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","Helene, my guess is you'll see a lot of Rapid Reward redemptions early on, a lot. We've been acquiring customers and credit card holders for the past year very, very intentionally. And they just, as you said, are building their points up. And as Gary said, we don't care. We would love to have that plane full of passengers. Whether it's a cash passenger or a Rapid Reward passenger, I'm indifferent. They are good customers and we're getting our financial piece out of that sale. That's how I think about it.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","I'll make one other quick business argument to you, which will hopefully give you \u2013 if you're not convinced yet, more comfort, which is remember, the awards are earned in two basic methods. One is you can fly and get a point, but you can also spend money with a credit card and get a point, and for those we get paid.","So the way we look at it, whenever we have a redemption, it's not zero dollars coming in. It's realizing the deferred revenue or the air traffic liability that was already received by Chase in payment of those points. So maybe some customers literally have \u2013 they're taking a \"free ticket,\" but most of them have a blend of credit card and flights. And so that makes it even easier to get comfortable that it's a good business decision for the company to manage the frequent flyer program this way.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, that's great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you for joining. And, ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications Officer.","Linda B. Rutherford - Southwest Airlines Co.","Abby, thank you. I think we'll go and get started with the media portion of our Q&A. So if you would, give them instructions on how to queue up for a question.","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin with our first question from Conor Shine with Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","I was wondering if you can provide any more information about what stage of the ETOPS certification process you guys are at. And then once that is presumably granted by the FAA, what kind of timeframe are you looking at between getting that approval and actually operating flights?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","I'll give you an update on the certification process, I will talk on the commercial side.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","So. Conor, I think Tom and I are going to double team on this.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Okay.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","So the ETOPS process takes around 12 to 18 months. That's generally the scheduled time for that process, and we're coming up on just about 12 months of work in there to date. So we have made \u2013 continue to make steady progress with the FAA on it. And I would say that we have completed really the regulatory reviews of the manuals.","And we've got the feedback from the FAA and made the changes, and we are transitioning now from the design and documentation of our ETOPS procedures into what I would call a demonstration phase. And that's characterized by us doing tabletop exercises with the FAA and then ultimately validation flights. And so we're in the process right now of trying to get those tabletops and those validation flights scheduled. So we've got a couple of months to still do that before the end of the year.","Hopefully, after we get that done and we would have the certification in place, then we will begin the process of selling the tickets and trying to book up. So we've got the resources and the locations ready in Hawaii. We've got the equipment there. We have our people bid and staffed, ready to go out there. And as soon as we get the approval from the FAA, we can start our training program with our people. And so on the operations side we'll be ready and then we'll just coordinate with the commercial side of the business.","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","I think, Conor, that once we get that certification, we're ready to go. Andrew and the commercial team have been working on the schedule and how that builds over time and how quickly that kind of thing, it's a great schedule. We're excited to get out there. But once we get the certification, then we'll publish the schedule and it will be flying within weeks or a month, I would think.","Back to what Mike was saying, our facilities are ready to go. Our teams are over there. The aircraft are ready, and we've been working on this for quite a while. So we are really just chomping at the bit ready to go once Mike pulls that trigger and says okay, commercial, we've got a go.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So, Conor, from the time we get the certification, it's days to publish is the way to think about it. And then what Tom was describing there is from the date that we then publish, we could be flying in weeks. I think a lot of that, when we fly we'll be more dependent upon what is the calendar. We don't want to start flying on Christmas Day, as an example. So that will be a factor. But anyway, you get the idea. There won't be a long timeline once we get the approval.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We will take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Thank you. Hey, Mike, I wanted to see if you could give an update on the engine fan blade inspections, how those have been going, and if you have continued to find any cracked blades.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Sure. Sure, Mary. So if you don't mind, I'll maybe just give everybody just a quick refresher course on the program because it's fairly complicated. But we do have roughly, as you know, Mary, 35,000 fan blades probably supporting our fleet. And the inspection program that's mandated out there today is to do recurring inspections every 1,600 cycles. And the inspection technique you use with that is an ultrasonic inspection technique. And so the engine remains attached to the wing of the airplane, and we do it on overnight checks with the airplane.","And that inspection technique is designed to tack cracks as small as 0.016 of an inch. Then in addition to those when the engines comes off for overhaul at the normal overhaul period, an Eddy current inspection is done, and that will detect a crack down to 0.021 inch. And so both of those detection capabilities give us multiple opportunities to identify cracks in any blade out there long before they would become an issue.","So, Mary, as you know, after we had 1380, a big fleet-wide inspection program not only just at Southwest Airlines but worldwide. And so we had identified some of the cracks during that process. But now we've got the steady stream in state, and we have not found any cracks with that UTI inspection process during our steady state of 1,600 cycles. But we did last month during a normal engine overhaul, there was a crack found with an Eddy current inspection. And again that was a small crack and so long before it became an issue.","So I think we should expect that on an ongoing basis, we'll find one or two of our 35,000 blades cracked through these processes. But that's why we're doing them. And I feel really good about the program that we have in place and I think we are hopefully killing it at this point in time.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Mary, the only thing that I would add just for emphasis is that, we know enough now to expect that a very small number of blades will show up with a crack. So that's what Mike is saying. That's what the protocol is for. I think that we and the manufacturer have been delighted with the success that we're having with our procedure. And again what Mike was describing with Eddy current, CFM or GE, I guess, does that. We don't do the Eddy current test and that's only done at the engine overhaul step, Mike...","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","That's right.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","But it's working as designed and we would expect to find a couple of cracks every year. Don't you think, Mike?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay. Great, thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","And Mary when you and I talked earlier, I may have misspoke, by the way. You were asking me about the flight cancellations. And I thought most of those were attributable to Florence. And I think Mike was pointing out \u2013 I don't know if you heard his report earlier, but most of that, it sounds like, Mike, was in Denver and Baltimore.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Southwest Airlines Co.","That's right.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","So I just want to \u2013 if that was important to you, I want to make sure that you know that I was a little off-track on my answer earlier.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg LP","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Tracy Rucinski - Thomson Reuters","Hi. When you talk about identifying new revenue streams, can you just give us a little more direction of what you're analyzing? Is the possibility of charging bag fees on the table?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Yeah, I don't mind doing that. I'm not going to give you much information, but I would say so that your mind doesn't go there that we're not thinking charging for bags. We're not thinking about charging change fees. The good news is, we have other opportunities that we can explore that will actually enhance the Southwest brand and not detract from it. So that will absolutely be our goal.","And by the way, I'll just quickly add, I don't think it would be revenue positive for us to charge for bags. That's sort of implied by my earlier comment. We like the fact that it's more customer-friendly, but we also believe that we get more customers and therefore more revenues by that approach. And it helps to be the only airline that does that. So it provides a bit of \u2013 interestingly some distinctiveness that we've, I think, capitalized on very well.","Tracy Rucinski - Thomson Reuters","Okay. Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","But otherwise, I can't really give you any other teasers as to what we are up to until it's ready for primetime. And that's \u2013 sorry, it's just not ready yet.","Tracy Rucinski - Thomson Reuters","Okay.","Operator","We will take our next question from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Alison Sider - The Wall Street Journal","Thanks. Yeah. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit, how you're seeing the mix between business and leisure travelers right now. If you're sort of depending more on business travelers and close-in bookings to drive more of your revenue, and if you're seeing any pullback from leisure if that's sort of behind some of the drop in the load factor?","Thomas M. Nealon - Southwest Airlines Co.","This is Tom, Alison. We're seeing strength in both leisure and business. In fact, what we're really seeing, it's not just strength in both of them, but we're seeing our corporate sales slice of business really perform very nicely. And I think part of that does have to do with some of the revenue management techniques and tools we talked about earlier in terms of some of our pricing techniques and our ability to create higher value itinerary result kind of stuff.","But bottom line is I'm getting to revenue management behind you. I think that our corporate business is really performing really nicely. We are seeing very strong performance there in terms of loads and in terms of fares in passenger. And I think that our leisure business just continues to perform nicely. So at 84% load factor, which is down a point, isn't bad, we still carry worth 40 million passengers. So we feel really good about that, but the mix is very strong and our business mix is really picking up.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","If it's kind of a broader economic, sort of more macro insight question which we get often, we're not seeing any signs of economic weakness and demand is very strong. I agree with Tom, that the business versus leisure mix is very strong. Corporate sales is a real outlier with its strength and it's just an overall very good report.","Alison Sider - The Wall Street Journal","Thanks.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Ghim-Lay Yeo with FlightGlobal. Please go ahead.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, you mentioned just now that Southwest saw some revenue weakness in Mexico in the third quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about that? How bad was it? Is it getting better from the airlines perspective? And what is Southwest doing to work against it? Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","Well, yeah, a great question. And of course, I'll just talk more broadly if you don't mind about our international segment and it's relatively small. It's only roughly 3.5% of our capacity. But Mexico in particular is off trend. And really it's not just the third quarter. It's this year. And I think the rest of the industry has been reporting the same thing.","I did share with you that if you just take domestic versus international, our domestic performance was RASM up 2.3%. If my memory is accurate it'll be close at least on the international segment on really a modest capacity increase overall, but the international segment was down about 3.5%. So it's a pretty big gap between international and domestic.","I'm a believer in Mexico and we've had a really strong demand up until this year from leisure customers going to the beaches. And I think that will return, but I think we've seen a pretty widespread weakness across the travel industry. And you could speculate on the reasons as well as I could but consumers have options, and if they feel like they've got better options, they'll go other places. So it may have in fact helped our business in other Caribbean beach destinations for all I know. But in any event, we're definitely seeing \u2013 like the rest of the industry, we're definitely seeing a weakness this year. And I don't see any signs of that abating dramatically, but it does sound like it's not getting worse and maybe we'll see some strengthening here.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal","Right. Are you planning to cut any capacity on those flights to Mexico?","Gary C. Kelly - Southwest Airlines Co.","We're not ready to make any cuts at this point. The only thing that I would say is that \u2013 and Tammy made this very clear with her comments with the analyst is that our focus with our \u2013 not more than 5% growth in 2019 \u2013 is Hawaii. And so we're not planning on adding any meaningful amount of international flying in 2019 because of that. But we haven't shared whether we plan to trim any routes and that's something that we routinely do. But again, there's nothing to share about that at this point.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - FlightGlobal","Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda B.

Joining the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President, and CEO; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","At this time, I\u2019d like to go ahead and turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary Kelly","Thank you, Marcy and good morning everybody and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings call. We are celebrating, this is a terrific quarter and really a terrific year. I am very proud of all of our people, all 47,000 of them and I want to thank them and congratulate them on these stellar results. This is the culmination of years of hard work on their part as well as daily dedication to running a great airline and taking great care of our customers. ","While it is true that the majority of the 71% surge in our earnings-per-share was due to a dramatic drop in jet fuel prices, there are a lot of other good things happening in this quarter. Our Rapid Rewards program continues to grow in terms of members and revenues and obviously the amended credit card deal is a highlight for the quarter and for future years. ","Next, our core passenger business overall is solid and steady and that's despite the very brisk competitive environment that we find ourselves in. I'm especially pleased with our record load factor and record revenues considering the aggressive Dallas, Love Field expansion, the transition of the AirTran markets this year, the slot acquisitions at DCA and LaGuardia and our continuing international expansion. ","Next, our cost performance was also very good. Profit sharing was up significantly and of course that\u2019s a very good thing. Our nine-month accrual for profit sharing was a record $484 million and well earned by our people and of course they too are benefiting from dramatically lower fuel prices. ","As far as the year 2015 goes, I just want to recap our plan for a perspective. This year is a confluence of events, some planned and some not but the result is spectacular. We have significant opportunities to expand, Dallas, Love Field, Washington Reagan, LaGuardia International, Houston International all converging here in 2015. ","While we have significant opportunities, we also have significant access to low-cost incremental capacity to pursue these opportunities and that\u2019s through the restoration of our aircraft utilization to more historic levels and our fleet over the last several years has been underutilized as we\u2019ve been going through the merger process. ","And then finally with dramatically lower fuel prices, we have the cushion to mitigate this expansion risk and actually been very fortunate to help \u2013 have that help to drive record profits at the same time that we\u2019re growing. So we\u2019ve been able to significantly augment our revenue production this year also with the amended credit card deal. ","So all this has supported our growth plan of 7% in ASMs for 2015 and still resulted in record earnings and returns and our plans for 2016 are unchanged from our previous guidance. We are expecting unit revenue growth year-over-year in fourth quarter \u201815 which has been an improvement from the third quarter and that's primarily because our developing markets are continuing to mature rapidly. So we expect to end this year with roughly 700 airplanes and add roughly 15 aircraft next year, again for an available seat mile growth of between 5% and 6%. ","So the work over the last five years in particular has come together exceptionally well. We\u2019re exceptionally well positioned for future growth and that will continue dependent upon our continued success with our low fare brand which of course is built with low-cost and our transparency and we\u2019re exceptionally well-positioned for future growth but also dependent upon our continued success with our customer service and especially the hospitality of our people which is something that Southwest is beloved by our customers for. ","So with that brief overview, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Tammy Romo, our CFO who will take us through the quarterly results.","Tammy Romo","Thanks, Gary and welcome everyone. We are pleased to report incredibly strong third quarter results marked by many records. ","Our third-quarter earnings excluding special items were a record $623 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, an increase of 71% over last year\u2019s $0.55 per diluted share. Our GAAP net income was $584 million, including $39 million in special items. In addition to our usual special items related to out of period fuel hedging adjustments, we had two other large special items this quarter. First, we recorded an expense of $140 million associated with the tentative agreement with our pilots in accordance with accounting guidance, and second, as we discussed last quarter, we had a special revenue item of $172 million related to the required change in accounting methodology as a result of our amended credit card agreement with Chase. That was effective in July. ","Our operating income excluding special items was a third quarter record $1 billion which produced nearly a 700 basis point improvement in operating margin of 20.3%. And to top up these records, we produced a 12-month trailing pre-tax return on invested capital, excluding special items, of 31.1%. So congratulations to all of our terrific employees on this outstanding achievement. ","Total operating revenues in the third quarter, also a record, were $5.3 billion, up 10.8% year over year on a capacity increase of 7.6%. Passenger revenues were also a record $4.7 billion. Demand for our low fares remained very strong throughout the quarter resulting in nearly 9% growth in traffic and an all time quarterly high record low factor. The yield environment remained but stabilized and sequentially our third quarter unit revenue trends were above average driven by our credit card agreement with Chase, which again was amended in July. ","Our third quarter operating revenues included a $300 million from the amended Chase contract and resulting change in accounting. Included in that benefit was a one-time non-cash adjustment of $172 million, that reduced the deferred revenue liability and thereby increased revenue. This was recorded as a special revenue adjustment and was excluded from the RASM that we reported. The remaining $130 million incremental benefit was due to the improved economics of the co-brand contracts and required accounting treatment combined. This $130 million benefit was about a 2 to 3 point improvement to RASM and we expect a similar benefit in fourth quarter 2015 which is incorporated with the guidance. I will discuss here with you shortly. ","With the amended agreement with Chase and change in accounting treatment, our third quarter 2015 passenger revenues would have been $40 million higher and our other revenues would have been $170 million lower for a net incremental reduction to operating revenues of $130 million and of course we wouldn\u2019t have had the $172 million special revenue adjustment. ","As Gary said, our Rapid Rewards program overall is a huge success and continue to contribute a significant incremental revenue year over year. On a unit basis, our third quarter operating revenues declined 0.4% on a 7.6% capacity increase and we are pleased with this very solid performance especially considering the impact of increased station scheduling which impacted our third quarter year-over-year unit revenues by about two points, as well as the high percentage of development markets which impacted year-over-year unit revenues by an additional point. ","For third quarter about 18% of our network was under development. We are delighted as we have been talking about here for some time with the performance of these new markets which are performing at or above our expectation and Dallas continues to outperform the systems margins and returns with a robust demand in all facets of our Dallas growth. ","International is also developing as planned and again very excited to begin international service out of Houston last week. ","So looking ahead to fourth quarter, so far demand for our low fares remains strong. Based on our current bookings and revenue trends we are estimating fourth quarter RASM will increase approximately 1% year over year, including about a $130 million estimated benefit from the Chase agreement and corresponding change in accounting treatment. ","Considering the estimated 2 percentage point impact of more stage engaged as well as another point impact from 12% of our network under development, all year-over-year we are very pleased with our fourth quarter revenue outlook. ","Turning to freight and other revenues, we are also very pleased there and we currently expect our fourth quarter freight revenues to be comparable to third quarter this year and as I discussed previously, other revenues increased significantly year-over-year and that was largely due to the amended Chase agreement. And in addition to certain ancillary revenues such as EarlyBird and Upgraded Boarding, those were also strong contributors to our other revenue growth. The growth in such ancillary revenues completely offset the loss of AirTran\u2019s ancillary revenues, so we were \u2013 again just a strong performance from the ancillary revenue side. ","We expect another significant year-over-year increase in fourth quarter 2015 other revenues largely due to the combined impact of the Chase agreement and required accounting treatment change. ","So now I will walk through our cost performance briefly. Third quarter unit costs excluding special items decreased approximately 8% year-over-year due to substantially lower fuel prices and cost control particularly fleet modernization. Our economic fuel costs decreased almost $300 million year-over-year driven by the 25% decline in fuel prices and an improvement in fuel burn. Our fuel price per gallon declined $0.74 to $2.20 versus $2.94 in third quarter of last year. And our third-quarter fuel burn improved 1.8% year-over-year reducing our third-quarter fuel costs by approximately 80 million and we are on track to achieve our target of at least 74 that we mentioned in last November at our investor day. ","Based on our hedge position and market price just as of Monday we expect our fourth quarter \u201815 fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.05 to $2.10 range which is well below fourth quarter last year\u2019s $2.62 per gallon. And since last fall, we -- just remind everybody, we\u2019ve significantly participated in the market decline and we currently expect 2015 economic fuel costs to decline approximately $1.3 billion over last year. ","Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were up less than a percent which was largely driven by the 77% year-over-year increase in profit sharing and our profit sharing expense increase is a record 484 million as Gary mentioned. Excluding profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit costs decreased 1.6% year-over-year which way better than expected due to some cents particularly in advertising and technology related to project costs that had been shifted to fourth quarter 2015 and better-than-expected airport costs. ","Our modernization remains on track to produce an estimated 700 million EBIT this year even with the drop in fuel prices. Based on current cost trends we expect total fourth quarter unit cost excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing to be comparable to fourth quarter last year\u2019s $0.0822. ","Now I will move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our investment grade balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong and we ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our free cash flow was $1.6 billion with $583 million in third quarter alone. Our very strong cash flow generation has allowed us to deliver on our commitment to return significant value back to our shareholders while we continue to reinvest prudently in our business. ","During the third quarter we repurchased 500 million in common stock which brings our share repurchases this year to nearly 1.2 billion thus far. We received approximately 9.7 million shares under the $500 million accelerated share repurchase during -- and we expected to receive the remaining 25% of total shares expected by the end of this month. ","We currently have 700 million remaining of the 1.5 billion repurchase program that was authorized in May of this year. We\u2019ve also repaid $170 million in debt and capital lease obligations thus far this year and our leverage including off-balance-sheet aircraft leases is in the low to mid 30% range. We continue to estimate our 2015 capital spend to be approximately $1.8 million and that excludes assets constructed for others which is estimated to be in the 50 million to 100 million range and that includes approximately 1.1 billion in aircraft spend. And for 2016 we continue to estimate aircraft spend in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range with total CapEx estimated to be roughly $2 billion. ","Turning to our fleet plans for just a quick minute. We ended third quarter with 692 aircraft in our fleet and continue to expect our fleet to end with roughly 700 by the end of this year. And regarding capacity, our fourth quarter available seat miles are estimated to increase year-over-year approximately 8.5% on year-over-year seat growth of 4.4%. ","Our full year capacity growth remains on pace to increase approximately 7% year-over-year with the seat growing only 2.9% year-over-year which as you all know is driven in large part by Dallas\u2019 new non-stop \u2013 longer haul flying and also on Washington Reagan, LaGuardia and our new international markets. ","Our 2016 growth plans haven\u2019t changed, as Gary said, and we continue to expect to grow our available seat miles for the full year in the 5% to 6% range versus 2015 and as a reminder the vast majority of 2016\u2019s growth will simply be the annualized impact of 2015 capacity additions that we discussed. ","So in conclusion, we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with our results this quarter. Substantially lower fuel prices along with solid revenues and cost controls produced a record earnings and our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong and we continue to be disciplined with our approach to capital allocation as evidenced by a very strong return on invested capital. ","So with that brief overview, I would like to close again by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and outstanding contributions to these strong results. Tom, with that, we\u2019re ready to take questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now begin with our first question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth ","Just on the growth opportunity, I\u2019d like to discuss \u2013 and you\u2019ve kind of talked about things, still being a substantial and a domestic growth opportunity here. I was wondering, does that come from just routes that you are not in today that you want to add or is it more from just increasing frequency and gaining share in the markets that you are in today, outside of what we see happen in Dallas?","Gary Kelly","We have 85 domestic mainland 48 state destinations today. I don't believe we have many more dots that we can add to the route map, so that\u2019s first part of the answer. Among the 85 we have a variety of opportunities to add non-stop segments and especially in short haul markets if those markets begin to return to pre 2000 traffic levels we will have a lot of opportunities to add frequencies in those markets as examples. ","Savi Syth ","And I guess you\u2019ve also talked about \u2013 I think I see new [ph] and articles talking about the potential to gain share in the long haul market, now again going to Dallas, I understand that was kind of an artificial kind of holding back in that market but wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on -- your comment on long haul market, market share opportunity and why maybe Southwest is lagging there and how you kind of ago about increasing that market share?","Gary Kelly","Savi, ,I think what you are picking up there was an interview that was done with Fortune and I really think that\u2019s old news, so that article was really recounting where we\u2019ve come over the last decade, so that was much more of a story 10 or 15 years ago. Today we are very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made, you are very familiar with the initiatives that we\u2019ve been working on over the last five years. So I think prospectively that would not be our messaging today that we believe that we can gain share in long haul markets. ","Now in terms of the expansion opportunities that we have, just geographically, since we\u2019re just now getting started flying trans-border, obviously those will be long haul opportunities but that's really more a function of us building off of our domestic base having a very small presence internationally and having a lot of potential destinations that we can add to our route map. So we are pleased with the customer experience as we have it today. We are very pleased with the market performance whether it\u2019s long, medium or short and we are happy to have the 737-800 as a component of our fleet. It\u2019s just performing exceptionally well. ","Savi Syth ","And if just may, what I am trying to understanding, Gary, is just the opportunity growth 5% to 6% type levels in the future. I am trying to understand is how much of that comes from domestic, I know the past commentary on international has been more of kind of slow growth and it\u2019s 1% of ASM, so it\u2019s a small base. Just trying to figure out, as you look out over the next three, four years even, just how the growth will be \u2013 what\u2019s the composition of the growth and what level of growth is reasonable for Southwest?","Gary Kelly","Well, the only guidance I can give you on the growth rate is for 2016 and there we\u2019re going to grow 5% to 6%. Next year, about a point or two of that will be international and beyond that we will just take that on a year-to-year basis and we will pursue the opportunities that are the most advantageous for us. Over time I think that most of our growth opportunities in the future will skew towards domestic but clearly most of these, virtually all of the new destinations will be international. But we are not operating under a route target either way. We've got decisions that we\u2019re making still even for 2016 as to what we want to do with the additional capacities that we are adding next year. So again as Tammy has already pointed out, there is not much new plan for 2016 anyway because most of it is just going to be the full year effect of decisions that you are already familiar with here in 2015. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates ","Realize it\u2019s little early to comment on 2016 unit cost trends, can you offer any color at least directionally on what we should expect in 2016 assuming the pilot deal is ratified and can we look at the Q4 run rate of flat as a good proxy?","Tammy Romo","And Julie, you were breaking up a little bit there but I believe that you were asking about our 2016 cost performance, if I picked your question up right, is that correct?","Julie Yates ","Correct. Yes, I just said it, I know it\u2019s a little early but can you offer any color directionally assuming that the pilot deal is ratified and can we look at the Q4 run rate of flat as a good proxy as we move into next year?","Tammy Romo","Sure. I can provide a little bit of color but we are still working through our 2016 plans, so I am not prepared to give you cost guidance here today. But just a couple of items of note, as you are thinking through 2016, while I would expect ongoing benefit from our fleet modernization effort, I wouldn\u2019t expect the year-over-year impact to be as significant as this year since we are passing anniversary of 717 so we still get some benefit there. I\u2019d also anticipate some cost pressures particularly salary raises and benefits, I think you noted and in addition, while we aren\u2019t prepared to provide an implementation date of our reservation system until we get past a couple of milestones here, I would encourage you to keep in mind that we would expect to have some training costs associated with that implementation as well. So but as always, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated year in, year out that we are very diligent when it comes to our cost control effort and we will work hard here and 2016 but until we have completed our planning effort here for 2016, I will hold off on giving you any specific guidance until later this year. ","Julie Yates ","I mean to be clear, is that going to be later this year or will that be in January with Q4?","Tammy Romo","Well, it may be with Q4 with earnings, I don\u2019t know, Julie, well but it will be later, I am just not prepared here today to give you specific guidance yet simply because we are still working through our plans with respect to cost for 2016. ","Mike Van de Ven","Julie, the only thing I was going to add to what Tammy said is that again to be clear, with the pilot tentative agreement, if that is ratified, that will be a cost for that work group, that will be a cost increase next year but that is an investment in our people, it\u2019s an investment in Southwest Airlines, it gives us certainty that we can plan around and obviously our objective here is to work together to grow Southwest Airlines. So obviously we\u2019re very pleased to have the tentative agreement and we should know the results of that voting here in I guess two weeks. ","Julie Yates ","Gary, let me ask you something we had talked about I think during the headquarters back in May, about you guys continuing to focus on expanding your fundamental margins. And so you are doing that again in the fourth quarter now that your RASM is back to positive and your costs are flat. Looking into next year, would you expect the spread for RASM to exceed the growth in CASM?","Gary Kelly","That will clearly be the target in that I would just again defer to Tammy and repeat what she said which is once we are ready we will provide the cost outlook for next year but part of the strategy with our growth in \u201915 and \u201916 is to allow this large percentage of markets that are under development, give them a chance to mature next year, so the percentage of markets under development a year from now, I think, Bob, will be in about the 5% range -- ","Bob Jordan","Yes.","Gary Kelly","So clearly we are well set on expectations for some tailwinds here with the RASM improvement and do the best job we can to match that up with some of the cost pressures that Tammy has referred to for next year. But clearly that will be our objective. ","Tammy Romo","And Julie, the only other thing I would add to that, just keep in mind, we will have a full year impact from the Chase agreement. So just make sure to factor that into your thought as you are thinking about next year. ","Gary Kelly","And you all, I know, will take some time to evaluate our revenue results but there is quite a bit of noise in those numbers. They look very solid today, whether you tease apart, the increase in the stage length, the increase in the gauge, some of the effective reclassification for accounting purposes for passenger revenues to other, there is quite a bit of noise there and it looks very good. So it\u2019s just helpful that even with the noise the fourth quarter number shows a positive, so you don\u2019t have to go through a lot of this analysis but if you are careful and you look at the analysis, I think you will be pretty impressed with the revenue performance here in the third quarter also. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani ","Just first on capacity growth as you look at next year, can you just talk about that cadence and maybe compare that the beginning of the year going towards maybe the end of the year?","Tammy Romo","In terms of just the capacity, Rajeev, yes, you will see similar \u2013 in terms of ASM growth you will see similar trends in the first quarter as you are seeing here in the fourth quarter, and then it will obviously taper out as we go through the year. ","Rajeev Lalwani ","And then just continuing on a lot of comment around the revenue environment, I was just hoping to get more color, Gary touched on sort of competitive environment, so just to get your thoughts on sort of what makes that calm down going forward, is it fuel, is it just lapping certain dynamics, just your thoughts there would be great?","Gary Kelly","Well, I am chuckling because you are talking about competition in the industry et cetera, so we are doing well in this environment, we are a low cost carrier, we are a low fare brand and we are growing and we love the competition and we love being pro-consumer. So I think we will continue to manage our growth according to our ability to generate appropriate returns and we\u2019re going to continue to work very hard to deliver on our low fare brand promise to our customers. So low fares is our specialty and our business and we\u2019ve been profitable for 42 years with that, so I would expect that will continue. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. ","Darryl Genovesi ","So Gary, you\u2019ve got a couple things going on, I guess, you\u2019ve got some new IT on the merchandising side and at the same time your average stage length continues to increase. And I just wondered if you could give us some updated thoughts on, any perhaps big picture kind of changes to the product positioning that you are concerned currently and others, been various questions asked on this topic over the years, which is wondering kind of how you are thinking currently about, things like perhaps doing a premium economy, perhaps plugging in more of a seat selection ability in the main cabin, those types of opportunities, anything you could say would be helpful?","Gary Kelly","You bet, and again thanks for the question there. So and you are right, we are continuing to invest in the company in various ways, so we have investments underway that are physical in nature in terms of airport capacity, we just opened up Houston Hobby, we\u2019ve got a large project underway at LAX, we\u2019ve got a large project underway at Fort Lauderdale which will create international flying capability there. So that\u2019s one thing that we are doing that I think fits in somewhat with your question. ","From a technology perspective, we are replacing our reservation system but there is a broader commercial agenda that will roll out, Bob, over the next five years, I would say, lot of it will come on line sooner than that. But that will give us significantly updated capabilities to pursue our commercial goals, and then thirdly, we also have a similarly large agenda with Mike Van de Ven and his team on the operations side of the house. So there is a lot of infrastructure investment taking place. There is a lot of infrastructure spending by the way that will be occurring in 2016, so that will be something that Tammy will want to share when we are ready here at a future date. We are excited about all of that. ","With respect to the customer experience, there is no question that we will have better tools in the future to make more tactical decisions in terms of changes to the current approach. Having said that, and looking at the current results and our expectation for 2016, I am very happy with our customer experience and our focus right now is very much on the basics. It is using the tools that we have to improve the reliability of our operation and also to invest in our people to improve the hospitality of our customer service, and that we can do without new technology and it\u2019s something that we are very excited about, the technology I think will certainly enhance our ability to better execute against those two goals. But we are really happy with the product that we have right now. I think we\u2019ve actually got opportunities to improve further and the kinds of considerations that you are asking for, I think, something that we can think about in the future but we have no plans to make any changes that are material along those lines. ","Darryl Genovesi ","And then Tammy, on the fuel hedge margin, it looks like you reversed about half of what you had posted last quarter, I think it looks like you\u2019ve got about $200 million left. Should that come through in Q4?","Tammy Romo","Yes, that\u2019s correct. We provided you the liability and for the remainder of 2015 I want to say that in the 100 million to 125 million range, I think it was 116 million.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays. ","David Fintzen ","Question on the Wright Amendment and flying, now that you\u2019ve got \u2013 I guess, about a year thereabout, do you view the new flying as markets that have sort of jump started the typical market development cycle where you\u2019re going to get to that 18 to 24 months processing you got there quite fast, or do you think it\u2019s sort of these markets from here developed \u2013 like they are not finished developing that continue to go?","Gary Kelly","It\u2019s both. First of all, we\u2019ve never had anything like this. It\u2019s a pretty unique \u2013 well it\u2019s a very unique scenario and we were already in those markets already and had a lot of customers and I know you know all of this. So that clearly gave us a head-start and it allowed us in terms of our planning, if you go back 12 months before the launch of these flights, it allowed us to be more bold and more aggressive and just believing that those flights wouldn\u2019t be a drag on our earnings, as we were \u2013 our objective for 2013, \u201914 and \u201915 was to hit our earnings targets and we\u2019ve done that. Having said that, while they\u2019ve out of the box virtually every flight, not literally but the almost every flight has been very successful financially. They are still developing, I mean any \u2013 as you know, our flight activity is up 50%, I believe the available seat mile capacity is up 188%. We all know that is huge and there are bound to be some imperfections there that need to be tuned. So we will continue to look at our schedule and we will continue to look at our revenue management and with the idea that we will continue to improve from here. But it is with the understanding that \u2013 and we\u2019ve been very clear about this of the financial performance out of Dallas has been superb from day one. So the improvement may not be as sharp in those markets as it will be in some others but nonetheless I absolutely would expect that we will continue to see improvement from that capacity. ","David Fintzen ","And just maybe a quick one in terms of \u2013 couple of weeks from new we find out about the TA, if it is voted down, how does the CASM guide change for the fourth quarter? ","Tammy Romo","We will \u2013 if there is any change to our guidance, we will just update you as appropriate later this quarter. ","Gary Kelly","And the first \u2013 just trying to help you a little bit here, that you don\u2019t get a full quarter change because \u2013 and think about the fourth quarter, because the effective pay rate change date is November 1, Mike, if I remember right. So it\u2019s not the \u2013 we would have a full quarter effect of the pay increase in the fourth quarter.","David Fintzen ","And in terms of how the contract is implemented, are there other things that sort of \u2013 from a crew planning standpoint et cetera that, sort of hit you cost wise upfront that you kind of manage over time or is it once the sort of contract goes in, that\u2019s kind of the \u2013 that\u2019s right run rate on the pilot side?","Gary Kelly","Again, I think we will need to win that is all certain one way or the other. I think we will need to go into the effects of the contract. But at least for the time being you\u2019ve got good guidance from Southwest on the fourth quarter cost outlook. We booked the accrual for the bonus and with that we are assuming in our guidance that the agreement is ratified. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg ","Just two quick ones here. Tammy, the next year\u2019s growth of 5% to 6% ASMs, do you have a \u2013 what percent on departures, I think you gave us departure growth for the fourth quarter and then the new Houston International terminal and it looks like you have been adding international flights from some other markets, how should we think about what part of that is international, split between international and domestic?","Tammy Romo","For 2016?","Michael Linenberg ","Yes, 2016.","Tammy Romo","Most of that\u2019s going \u2013 it\u2019s going to be weighted obviously towards domestic, so a small, I guess, probably call a point or so would be international and rest of that would be domestic. ","Michael Linenberg ","And then just the departure growth rate?","Tammy Romo","Yes. Our seats \u2013 we are expecting those to be up \u2013 somewhere, 3.5, call it, 3.5%, 3.6% and that is going to \u2013 of course Dallas, LaGuardia and Reagan National and that\u2019s call it probably half of that, and then the remainder with the other \u2013 just regional additions that we make here this year. ","Michael Linenberg ","And just second question, I caught it somewhere in the press, I think it was reported that you paid $120 million to get access to the Love Field gates, so I was just wondering maybe if you could talk about how you got to that share value and whether or not \u2013 I mean do you have exclusivity of those gates or will you have to accommodate Delta, what\u2019s the story there?","Gary Kelly","Well, I will answer the question, Mike and I just want to recognize that we are under a gag order from the federal judge on this case. So I am going to be very careful not to \u2013 not comply with his order. But the value was pretty straightforward, we simply looked at the equivalent values for slot controlled airports, slots are readily traded, and I would argue to you that there is no more effectively slot controlled airport in the United States than Dallas, Love Field. So it was pretty straightforward on how we arrived at that value and obviously you heard our results from Love Field. ","With respect to the exclusivity, this sub-lease operates like any other airport lease where, yes, we do have preferential rights to the gates and then are required to make reasonable accommodation which simply means if you have room available, then you can\u2019t prohibit someone from using the gates and that\u2019s the way it works, that\u2019s where it works at Love Field, that\u2019s the way it works everywhere. Obviously there is no room at Love Field for anybody other than Southwest on our gates, by the way we are operating. ","Tammy Romo","Again, Mike, just one clarification, the numbers I gave you are for a carryover and it wasn\u2019t clear if your question was carryover or in total, but it\u2019s not going to move a lot, it\u2019s probably somewhere in that 4%, the seats are probably somewhere in the 4% growth range. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay ","We all think of Dallas as being Dallas obviously, that is very competitive, and the reality is two different airports there and at times they behave like different markets. So I love to hear what you guys have discovered as the Wright Amendment route is still up about the competitive dynamics in Dallas. In terms of sort of when Love Field and DFW truly compete with each other and maybe when they don\u2019t as in maybe does the competitiveness become a little bit less important during trough period travel times, and are there times maybe these two airports may be distinct to \u2013 more distinct to one another than maybe a lot of people realize it at a high level, anything you can share of your experience are appreciated. ","Gary Kelly","I would be happy to. I would say more than any other dual or multiple airport market that I can think of, they operate as one airport, and they have \u2013 I have been here for 30 years and they always have. So the prices are matched, they are matched, obviously when it\u2019s Swiss Airlines leaving in the market, it\u2019s been rate historically to have any low fare offering at DFW because of the dominance of that airport. So really it was left to Southwest in this market to provide that low fare competition. That changed materially in 2006 when President Bush signed the Wright Amendment compromise because we could then begin offering itineraries beyond the Wright Amendment area and you saw prices come down significantly. Now we are able of course after 2014 to fly those markets non-stop and so there are more seats available at lower fares, you\u2019re seeing the increase in traffic not just at low but by virtue of that increased competition over DFW. What we\u2019ve typically seen over a 30-year period is as we\u2019ve grown with a focus on local traffic, the hub and spoke carriers and especially in DFW began to de-emphasize that and shift their focus to flow traffic which is why in the old days you\u2019d say one-third of the flight is coming from Southwest, one third from the City Pair, one-third from Delta, one-third from American and Southwest would have two-thirds of the traffic on that segment. Dallas, Houston was my all time favourite example, and that phenomenon continued more and more and more because they simply could not compete effectively with our cost on those \u2013 especially those short haul segment. So they absolutely compete, I talk to customers here in the DFW area all the time who tell me that they choose between DFW and Southwest for various reasons, or rather Love Field for various reasons and \u2013 I mean the same situation, I can drive to DFW just as fast as I can drive to Love Field, and obviously I drive to Love Field but they are very close together and it is much more of a single market than Houston as an example, or the Washington DC area, maybe it\u2019s more akin to the Bay Area where Oakland and SFO I think are pretty inter-changeable but it operates as one market. ","Hunter Keay ","And then as it relates to fuel hedging, Tammy, can you talk about some of the risk parameters that you guys put in place when you think about taking out a hedge position and how much you\u2019re willing to absolute in terms of not just premium expenses in terms of sort of downside and upside and collateral being posted, what are the risk parameters you use when putting on hedges and when you make unfortunate hedging choices, is there a level of accountability that exists within your department, if the bet \u2013 if the wrong choice is made?","Tammy Romo","I\u2019d be happy to walk you through that, Hunter. As you are aware, fuel represents one of our largest expenses, these are our first or second and it\u2019s really pretty straightforward. Our fuel hedging program is designed to provide an insurance when prices are rising. Obviously when prices are low, that\u2019s not as great of a risk and I think this quarter is evidence of that where we are producing very nice earnings. So we really look at our fuel hedging to help us mitigate the impact of the volatile swings that we see in fuel prices and just provide us at least a little more certainty with respect to what kind of fuel spikes we might have as we are planning for the future. So in terms of what do we think about, I think it\u2019s all the things that you would expect us to, we certainly do consider our balance sheet in determining how much risk we\u2019re able to absorb either on the high side or the low side, with respect to risk that we might be willing to accept with on the floor side. But that\u2019s simply what we do. We really do a lot of scenario planning to make sure that we are comfortable with the possible prices \u2013 possible fluctuations in fuel as we work through our plan. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of insight. So we are looking up and down the curve to make sure that we\u2019re comfortable when prices are high as well as when prices are low. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joseph Denardi with Stifel.","Joseph Denardi ","Gary, I think in that Fortune interview you also talked about potentially getting to a 90% load factor within five years. So I am wondering if that\u2019s how you are managing the airline whether Southwest can handle that operationally and whether you have the appropriate ancillary revenue stream to have that strategy make sense?","Gary Kelly","To be honest with you, I don\u2019t remember saying that. You might be right. Mike Van de Ven sitting next to me is about to punch me saying that, but I don\u2019t know \u2013 honestly I don\u2019t know if 90% is a realistic number or not, I really don\u2019t know the context of the statement. But today -- I will answer it today, rather than trying to reconcile or whatever is in that article. Last year, Mike, we were an 83% annual load factor, that is 15 points higher than what we produced 15 years ago in the year 2000, and a lot of that increase \u2013 of course, it\u2019s all been necessary that we\u2019ve had economic imperatives to adjust our schedule to have fewer empty seats, we are also carrying more connecting passengers, still heavily weighted towards non-stop passengers but I think that, that\u2019s all important background to think about your question. We lag the industry, think a lot of our employees believe that we are the highest low factor, but actually we lag in the industry because we don\u2019t hub and spoke and we don\u2019t schedule so intentionally for connecting customers. We\u2019ve had not more of that way in recent years but not nearly as much as the rest of the industry. So it seems to me unless we continue to evolve more towards trying to fill airplanes up with connections, we are going to be somewhere here in the low 80s, we are running a bit ahead this year over year ago, we just had a record low factor for the third quarter which was at 85%, that was up one point versus a year ago, it feels like we will probably beat last year\u2019s 83%-ish 2014 load factor, Mike, that we had, so I think we can kind of inch things along from here and I am happy at these levels, as long as the rest of our economics continue to be successful. ","So one of the things that we\u2019ve tried to do over the last five to 10 years is have more customers per departure, so we would be relying less on having to raise our fares. That\u2019s a great way to increase revenues and still keep our fares low. And obviously we\u2019re getting closer to the point where that may not be as achievable. I think we have opportunities to manage our revenues better with revenue management techniques that\u2019s one of the things that will come with our new reservation system and by adding value in areas like our frequent flier program. So very pleased with the improvement that we\u2019ve seen with our credit card compensation there. So we will continue to look for opportunities to grow our unit revenues and I think for the most part that will need to come from optimizing our route network and less so in terms of trying to fill more empty seats. ","Joseph Denardi ","And then I think at the investor day you also said that once you get beyond 2015, the growth out of Love that you see yourselves as a low single digit type grower domestically. Is that still the case or has that changed at all?","Gary Kelly","I am sorry, I was thinking about your question, so is the question about our domestic growth opportunities to grow beyond Love Field? Well, no, I think we\u2019ve got \u2013 we have a large opportunity to grow, it depends upon a number of things, it depends on fuel prices, fares, the economy, all things that you know, depends on our competition, but as we see things today, there are more than ample opportunities to grow domestically, and as I have said many many times, we will want to grow in a sensible way and we want to make sure that we maintain a strong balance sheet, we maintain hitting our profit targets, our return targets but it is important to grow, it\u2019s important to keep the customers that we have. We will need to continue to add service to meet their needs as long as the traffic is growing. So not growing is obviously not \u2013 it\u2019s not a good alternative but as the domestic economy continues to grow and especially if the short haul traffic continues to rebuild as \u2013 some of the early signs we\u2019ve seen here 2015, then we will have ample opportunities to grow. I am reluctant to put a number on it. Whatever I say really doesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019re going to grow at the rate that is justified by our financial parameters as well as the demand in the marketplace. And if we are lucky to have growth opportunities like we\u2019re experiencing right now out of Dallas, out of Washington, out of Houston International, then that will be fantastic and we will grow and we will manage it and we will continue hopefully to have a record earnings, that would be our goal. ","Joseph Denardi ","And then just a quick one, Tammy, can you provide what the no-show fee revenue was in the quarter?","Tammy Romo","Sure, I\u2019d be happy to pull that for you. It was 16 million for third quarter. ","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth ","Only two from me, I am not going to ask you six or seven. So on the other revenue line, it looks like you increased nicely even excluding the new credit card agreement. Can you just talk about what is driving that and trends you expect going forward?","Tammy Romo","Yes. As I mentioned \u2013 as opened the call, we have had a nice growth in our ancillary revenue, obviously the Chase agreement is benefitting significantly in the other revenue line. So that\u2019s going to be the large \u2013 that\u2019s going to be the biggest piece of that, Duane. And we also had a freight \u2013 freight and others are also performing well, so we were actually quite pleased because our ancillaries offset as you know, we had the AirTran back seats coming off that we were pleased that that, offset our revenue but it\u2019s primarily the Chase agreement and in addition we had a nice showing with EarlyBird and Upgraded Boarding, those are also contributors to our other revenue growth, and I think those are really the headlines. ","And one other note is just charters, we also had a very strong growth during the third quarter as well. I think our charters were up in the 20% to 30% range. ","Gary Kelly","Duane, again just I am saying the same thing Tammy is but the Chase deal \u2013 if I do my arithmetic here right, accounts for all that about 25 million of the increase. So there is a $40 million adjustment out of passenger into other, in addition to the 130 million that we\u2019ve been talking about, for the third quarter. So there is actually 170 million in other. ","Duane Pfennigwerth ","I think the trick was to get beyond AirTran because it was shrinking for a while and now it looks like it\u2019s growing even ex this deal. And then on the domestic res migration, it sounds like you are messaging little bit on the cost side, the things that we can sort of look forward to on the revenue side levers that you haven\u2019t pulled yet, can you give any update there, is it 2017, is it 2018, when can we start to get excited about the new levers that you haven\u2019t pulled yet? Thanks for taking the questions. ","Gary Kelly","Well, I am thinking to myself about the new levers that you must be referring to. In terms of the levers that we have been talking about, I think it\u2019s primarily our new reservation system, with some enhanced revenue management capabilities, so I will let Tammy talk about that. But beyond that \u2013 and she has already made this point \u2013 you get the full year benefit of the new credit card deal which is something we are excited about for next year, and then we are working really hard to mature our route network, it\u2019s gone through a lot of change over the last couple of years, we are absolutely expecting that we are going to drive more performance from that especially with the maturing of the developing markets. But Tammy, anything else you can add there?","Tammy Romo","No, I really don\u2019t have much to add to that. The first phase of that, I agree, would be the revenue management opportunity and just continuing to optimize the network, and then as we get past \u2013 turning on our new reservation system, we will certainly provide a more insight at that time. ","Duane Pfennigwerth ","So when we would you expect it to turn on, is that a \u201916 event?","Tammy Romo","We have not given the exact date yet but what we have said is that we will be on our current reservation through the end of 2016 and we have transitioned the systems beyond that. So we\u2019re getting closer, so just stay tuned and we will be back in probably not too much longer with more details on the timeline, but we\u2019re just not ready to lay out \u2013 all of that out for you today. ","Operator","That concludes the analyst portion of today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communications and Outreach.","Linda Rutherford","Good day everyone. We\u2019ll just jump straight to the questions, so Tom, if you could instruct them on how to queue up, we will get started. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Lindenberger with Dallas Morning News.","Michael Lindenberger ","I mean I wanted to ask you \u2013 you saved a lot of money on fuel and you\u2019ve made a lot of efforts to try to keep your prices low by finding other revenue, I guess, by volume. Is there any calculation that you ought to invest some of these savings rather than share buybacks but in more aggressive pricing to drive up your volume and just sort of give the flying public the benefit that you guys have been sharing with your shareholders currently?","Gary Kelly","Well, first of all, we want to be America\u2019s low fare leader and I think that we are. We are the only \u2013 I think the only \u2013 I was going to say the only major carrier \u2013 we\u2019re the only carrier that doesn\u2019t nickel and dime with bag fees, change fees, so we offer a tremendous value, and we have \u2013 we are meeting our financial goals with respect to our cash and our balance sheet and we are trying to serve all of our constituents, our people, our customers, our shareholders, so we are trying to take care of each one of those. Nobody a year ago saw a 50% decline in fuel prices looming. Nobody saw that, and so logic would tell you that as we sit here today it is going to be very difficult for any of us, you, me, Tammy, anybody, to predict what fuel prices will be a year from now. What I can tell you from experience is that it\u2019s very difficult to increase fares rapidly. Customers hate that and it tends to chase away demand very rapidly. Everyone of our legacy competitors that we compete against has been bankrupt over the past decade and bankrupted primarily because of surging fuel prices. So I think speaking for Southwest, I am very reluctant to take our customers through a rollercoaster ride fares and if we are all lucky, and energy prices remain low for an extended period of time, I can assure you that we will continue to offer low fares and continue to add flights and grow Southwest Airlines. So that\u2019s where the money is going. It\u2019s going back to invest in the infrastructure for Southwest, we\u2019re building new airports, we are building new technology for commercial purposes, for operational purposes and we are buying more airplanes. We are replacing our older airplanes and we are also adding growth so that we can expand in exciting places like we did last week by launching new international flights out of Houston. ","Michael Lindenberger ","If I can just ask one quick follow up, you mentioned the legacy airlines, obviously you guys have sort of stayed out of the flight between them and the Gulf carriers but it does implicate this sort of \u2013 you\u2019re all in the same competitive mix, not obviously as much on the international carriers, but I am just wondering if you think there is any weakness in the legacy carriers position of arguing against the Gulf carriers, huge gains in the US market base in large part by lower fares and better service?","Gary Kelly","Well, I would certainly acknowledge that we are all in the same industry but I would also be quick to add that we often take a differing view \u2013 with respect to the particular issue that you mentioned, it is not our priority, we haven\u2019t spent any time on it, and therefore we just have not taken a position. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Andrea Ahles with the Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles ","Hi Gary, if you -- I heard you talk on the call about the Love Field case with Delta, in front of a federal judge. Delta was asked last week if they plan to appeal the ruling, if it goes against them and I wanted to ask you the same question, will you appeal \u2013 the Southwest appeal the judge\u2019s ruling if it goes against Southwest?","Gary Kelly","Well, really I want to honor the judge\u2019s order here and comply first of all. We are looking forward to the decision and would expect that hopefully soon and I think we will respond accordingly at that time. ","Andrea Ahles ","You are not willing to come out like Delta side and say that yes, we definitely plan to appeal this to the Circuit Court if it goes against that.","Gary Kelly","I am not going to \u2013 not comply with the judge\u2019s order to not comment on this case. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Conny [ph] with The Associated Press.","Unidentified Analyst","I\u2019ve got two questions, because I think the first one is probably a quick answer but can you say what your early load factors are on those international flights out of Houston and also on the cost side, that labor cost line really stands out, and even if that includes the pilots ratification bonus, even if it does, you are still up 14.4% and I am wondering if that is going to be a trend that your investors should expect to see going forward?","Gary Kelly","David, on the latter, that\u2019s really profit sharing that\u2019s driving this. So I would welcome that kind of increase but yes, that\u2019s our variable pay component, when the company does well, our employees do even better. I\u2019ve talked more \u2013 I forgot your first easy question.","Unidentified Analyst","Houston Hobby load factors, international \u2013","Gary Kelly","Well I can report this, we\u2019ve got by far the majority of our destinations or leisure destinations, those load factors are consistently very high. These are brand new markets. I am expecting us to have periods of time now when we have pretty light loads. The only markets that we\u2019ve typically seen softer loads than we would like would be the more business markets which is primarily Mexico City and some of the flight times there aren\u2019t optimal yet with the slot controls that they have in place. But I was there on Thursday and virtually all every flight going out there was full. So early returns are pretty much what we would have expected and I think we will do very well in that market, the fares have been very high, we\u2019re going to come in with famous low fares and would very much expect to have the Southwest effect to kick in. ","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters. ","Jeffrey Dastin ","Has Southwest finished its response to the Justice Department, civil investigative demand and kind of give any other updates on where that process stands now?","Gary Kelly","I think the only thing that I can appropriately comment on is that we are fully complying with the civil investigative demand. Certainly we\u2019ve worked hard and turned over a lot of information but as to exactly where that stands, I can\u2019t really comment any further. ","End of Q&A","Operator","And at this time I would like to turn the call back to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.","Linda Rutherford","Thank you all very much. Of course, if there is any follow up questions, don\u2019t hesitate to call us or you can always reach out at swamedia.com and we will take care of you. Thanks and have a great day.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining.

My name is Tom, and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call to discuss our second quarter results. Joining me on the call today is Gary Kelly, Southwest Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and President of AirTran Airways; and Laura Wright, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will begin with opening comments from Gary, followed by Bob providing an update on the AirTran integration and operations, and then followed by Laura providing a review of our second quarter results and current outlook.","As a quick reminder, prior-year consolidated results include AirTran results beginning May 2, the date of the acquisition. In order to provide what we believe to be a more meaningful year-over-year comparison on today's call, we will also be discussing specified current results and providing outlook commentary on a combined basis as defined in this morning's press release.","Please be advised that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","As this call will include references to non-GAAP results such as combined results and results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.","Gary C. Kelly","Thank you, Marcy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased with our second quarter financial performance. Excluding items, second quarter profits of $273 million is an all-time quarterly record. It's up 126% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $0.36 is also an all-time record and it's up 140% year-over-year, and also $0.03 ahead of Wall Street estimates.","The sluggish economy was no help. High fuel prices were no help, although they at least were lower than the first quarter. But I give all the credit to our people at Southwest and AirTran. And once again, they did a great job of running a very high-quality airline with solid on-time performance, excellent baggage handling, outstanding schedule reliability. And at the same time, our people at both airlines are doing an exceptional job of integrating AirTran, and our people have done an extraordinary job of rolling out a lot of new initiatives like our All-New Rapid Rewards program, the Boeing 737-800, the Evolve seating retrofit for our 700s and a number of other initiatives.","And in particular, as we outlined in the release today, the AirTran integration is very much on track. The AirTran business was a significant contributor to our second quarter profit record. A couple of things to note there: First, I'm very proud of our team's efforts to get a deal with Delta and Boeing to replace all of the Boeing 717s and retire them from our fleet by the end of 2015. The operational and cost benefits are obvious with an all-Boeing-737 fleet. But the revenue benefits are huge, given that we've got 26 more seats with the 737 at essentially the same trip cost as the 717. So after gathering up all the one-time accounting charges for this deal in 3Q, the ongoing rental expense versus sublease income is essentially awash once we start delivering the 717s to Delta. And Laura is going to cover all of that in more detail in a few moments.","And further, we have significant technology work underway related to the AirTran integration. Our top priority is an international reservation system implementation that's on track for a 2014 deployment. Next is the systems capability at both airlines to connect the networks and the itineraries, and that work is on track for our first quarter 2013 deployment. In addition to core AirTran profits, that acquisition is contributing profit synergies in line with our expectations, and we continue to target $400 million in synergies from that for 2013, which is more than double the current run rate that we have.","Still related to AirTran, each airline continues to make aggressive but prudent schedule changes. International cities are being added in AirTran. Small cities that don't fit the Southwest model in this high-fuel-cost environment are being closed.","During the second quarter, Southwest picked up additional slots at Washington Reagan. We received authorization from the City of Houston City Council to proceed with an international facility at Hobby Airport, and that's targeted for 2015.","And work at Dallas Love Field is on target, on schedule and on budget, and all of that is in anticipation of the full Wright Amendment repeal in October of 2014.","So needless to say, there's a lot going on at Southwest. It is already bringing significant shareholder value, and there's a lot more to come over the next several years.","I want to thank our Board of Directors for their hard work and their devotion to driving shareholder value. In May, they increased our authorization to repurchase shares to $1 billion, of which half of that repurchase has been completed. And they also more than doubled the quarterly dividend to $0.01 a share.","Our strong cash flow, our leverage is low, our annualized return on invested capital for this quarter actually exceeded our 15% requirement. And so you can see why the board took these actions by all of these strong positions and strong performances.","And then finally, while we remain cautious about the domestic economy, our business seems to be holding up well. Fuel prices, at least right now, are no higher than they were in the second quarter and hopefully, they will be lower this quarter. But we're keeping our capacity roughly flat this year and next until we're comfortable with our earnings performance hitting our 15% return on invested capital target. And of course, this quarter's results were a great step forward in that regard.","So Bob, without further ado, I'll turn it over to you.","Robert E. Jordan","Well, thank you, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm really pleased to give you a report on AirTran. We continue to make great progress on the integration front. Five AirTran 737s have been converted to the Southwest delivery, and we've got another one in progress. We plan to transition 11 737 this year, and the majority of the remaining 41 we will transition in 2014 once international capabilities are in place in Southwest.","As Gary mentioned, the recent agreement with Delta and Boeing Capital to transition out of the AirTran 717s is a great deal for us. While that was not anticipated at the start of the acquisition, the opportunity to replace 717 flying with 737 flying offers -- that offers significantly more seats. And therefore, of course, revenue opportunity at essentially the same trip cost makes just perfect economic sense for us. The first 717s will transition in August of 2013, with the entire fleet exiting by the end of 2015.","On the labor front, the majority of our unions have seniority integration agreements in place, and we're making really good progress on the 2 that remain. We continue to transition AirTran employees to Southwest. The first groups of AirTran pilots and flight attendants have completed their moves, and over 1,000 AirTran employees have transitioned to Southwest and that number is rising each and every month.","Airport transitions continue, with ground operations folks beginning that transition at 6 stations last month. And AirTran's operations in Seattle and Des Moines fully convert to Southwest this quarter. Of course, optimizing the combined networks continues to be a major focus. We added several new AirTran international markets to the roadmap during the second quarter, and those were primarily funded through redeploying capacity from closed small cities.","And I'm just very pleased with the performance of those new markets. They all look very strong. And I'm extremely pleased and thrilled that the Houston City Council cleared the way for Southwest to build a new 5-gate international terminal at Hobby Airport. Construction there is planned to begin next year, with flying to destinations such as Mexico, the Caribbean and cities in Central and South America beginning in 2015.","We're making great progress towards implementing connecting capabilities during the first quarter of 2013, as Gary mentioned, and that, of course, opens up significant opportunities in the combined Southwest-AirTran networks ahead of full integration.","On the operation front, the AirTran operation continues to perform very, very well. They are posting stellar DOT results in all 3 categories. For example in May, which is the most recent month of results published, AirTran ranked first in the category of customer complaints, second in mishandled bags and third in on-time performance overall. So I'm just extremely pleased with the operation at AirTran and cannot be more proud of our people there.","Overall, AirTran's business continues to improve solidly year-over-year. And while still underperforming Southwest revenues on a nominal unit basis, positive RASM and yield trends continue. We realized net synergies in the first half of this year of approximately $80 million and our plan continues to call for reaching $400 million total pretax synergies in 2013 based, of course, on our current network and fleet plans.","So in summary, I am very pleased with our integration progress and timing. Our synergies are on track, the 717 deal is a great long-term deal for the company. And the AirTran folks are posting stellar operational results. And I think that's pretty darn good, and I'm very proud of our AirTran folks and their excellent work.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Laura Wright to walk us through the details.","Laura H. Wright","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, or afternoon, everyone. Excluding special items, our second quarter operating profits was an all-time record quarterly performance of $485 million. Revenue was solid throughout the quarter, producing record revenue results, and our nonfuel operating costs came in better than expected.","Although fuel prices on average were still very high, we benefited from the decline in market prices that occurred during the quarter, as evidenced by a roughly $60 million decrease in our economic fuel cost compared to both the second quarter of last year as well as to our expectations back in May.","We also have a $28 million year-over-year reduction in our non-operating expenses, excluding special items, and all-in, this led to a net income of $273 million, excluding special items, or $0.36 per diluted share, both quarterly records.","For the 12 months ended June 30, our pretax return on invested capital was 8%. And as Gary pointed out, our June quarter as stand-alone results exceeded the 15% annual target.","And overall, I would reiterate Gary and Bob's comments that we're very pleased with the second quarter results, particularly the improvements from a year ago.","Our passenger revenues increased over $400 million or 11.5% from last year's $3.9 billion. And on a combined basis, our passenger revenue is still a solid 5.1%.","On a unit basis, passenger revenues were up 6.4% versus combined results, and total unit revenues grew 6%. Our PRASM strength came primarily from our yields. They were up 6.7% on a combined basis. And as Bob noted, we continued to significantly improve AirTran's year-over-year revenue performance. However, on a nominal unit basis, we still have significant synergy opportunities yet to be realized on AirTran's network.","Southwest's mix of full-fare passengers was 17%, which was slightly down from first quarter's 18%. However, business traffic indicators that we monitor suggest that our business traffic has remained steady.","Our Business Select fare product contributed approximately $25 million in incremental revenues in the quarter, and our Wright Amendment revenues also continue to contribute significantly. We had $74 million of incremental revenues in the second quarter from Wright Amendment.","Our 800s and Evolve flights, which were just introduced in the second quarter, are already producing great results and they contributed millions collectively in 2Q '12.","All-New Rapid Rewards continues to perform well. We had approximately $75 million incremental cash sales from our business partners compared to the second quarter of last year. And cumulatively, our business partner cash sales from our frequent flyer program increased in excess of $300 million for the 12 months ended June 12 compared to the 12 months ended June 2011.","While the vast majority of this is still being deferred from a P&L perspective, thereby increasing our air traffic liability, we did recognize about $50 million additional incremental passenger revenue from the frequent-flier business partner sales in the second quarter '12 over last year.","Thus far, our July passenger unit revenue growth was solid. We do not expect our July passenger unit revenues to be up as much as June's 6% year-over-year increase due to softer July 4 holiday traffic, which is to be expected when July 4 falls in the middle of the week.","Our bookings in place thus far for the quarter look good and overall, we expect another solid third quarter unit revenue performance but do not expect the year-over-year growth to exceed second quarter's 6%.","Our freight and other revenues were in line with our expectation. And we currently expect that our third quarter freight and other revenues will decrease slightly from the third quarter 2011 freight and other revenues, primarily due to AirTran's fees trending lower year-over-year as their capacity is moved over to Southwest.","Our second quarter economic fuel price per gallon was $3.22, and that was down a $0.05 from the prior year combined. The $3.22 includes a net $0.04 unfavorable cash settlement from the lock-in losses from our legacy hedging portfolio. Our premiums in the quarter were $12 million, that's down from $26 million in the prior year. And our economic fuel costs were up $0.13 per gallon better than the last guidance that we provided in mid-May of $3.35. And that was really due to the $6 drop in oil prices since that time.","At current market prices, we expect that our third quarter economic fuel price, including taxes, will be in the $3.05 to $3.10 per gallon range. That's based on the July 17 forward pricing. This estimate includes an estimated $0.03 per gallon fuel hedging penalty and again, this relates to the lock-in losses from the legacy hedging portfolio.","Our third quarter hedge does provide protection if WTI prices average above $100 per barrel, as illustrated in this morning's press release.  However, we also participate in the third quarter fully and following prices until we reach WTI prices below $75 per barrel. Again, this is illustrated in this morning's press release.","Our third quarter premium expense is also expected to be about $17 million, and that's down from $36 million last year.","For the fourth quarter of 2012 and looking out into 2013, our current hedge portfolio provides a meaningful protection in the rising fuel price environment, again with that protection kicking in at $100 of WTI oil price and above. In the event prices drop from current forward levels, we will continue to participate in lower fuel prices fully until we hit at $75 per barrel WTI price in the fourth quarter as well as 2013.","Our second quarter unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, were up 4.3% year-over-year on a combined basis. And excluding profit-sharing, we're up 2.7%. This was better than we expected, and that was primarily due to lower maintenance, airport, depreciation and advertising costs. Maintenance was less than expected, due to fewer Evolve seating conversions and fewer heavier maintenance events than planned. Our airport costs benefited more than we anticipated from airport settlements we received during the quarter. And depreciation came in lower due to some of the changes we had in our aircraft retirement schedule. And finally, advertising was under planned as we deferred some of the spend that we had previously planned for the second quarter to the back half of 2012.","For the third quarter of 2012, we're currently anticipating our nonfuel unit costs, excluding special items and profit-sharing, will increase in the mid to high single-digit range compared to third quarter 2011's $0.0727. While we've had more modest cost increases in the first half of this year than expected, we do anticipate higher costs in the back half, primarily from maintenance, including Evolve, airport costs, depreciation and the deferred advertising.","We remain focused on controlling our core costs with significant opportunities ahead with our fleet modernization plans. On the non-operating cost side, we have significant year-over-year improvement. Our net interest expense for 2012 is expected to be down by $70 million on a combined basis due to paying down about $1 billion of debt. And as noted in the fuel discussion, our 2012 fuel hedging premiums, which are recorded in other gains and losses, are expected to be down approximately $65 million from 2011.","Let me provide a quick recap of our balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and short-term investments at quarter end were $3.3 billion, and as of yesterday were $3.7 billion. For the first 6 months of the year, we had $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations and over $800 million of free cash flow. Our leverage, including our off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is approximately 45% and is expected to decline at the low 40% range by year end.","And from August of 2011 through the end of the second quarter, we purchased approximately 500 million or 59 million shares of Southwest common stock under our current $1 billion authorization at an average price of $8.44.","I'll move to fleet and capacity. We had 14 737 Classics retirements during the second quarter, 3 of these were lease returns and the remainder owned aircraft, ending the quarter with 695 active aircraft. Of the 34 800 deliveries planned this year, there are 15 remaining. And we're still planning for 40 total Classic retirements this year, which will put our fleet count around 692 at year end.","In terms of our capacity plans, our 2012 available seat miles will be comparable to 2011's combined ASMs.","For 2013, we don't plan to grow the fleet, and we're planning for modest capacity growth compared to 2012.","Although we are increasing the aircraft gauge in 2013 with 800s and the additional 6-seats on our 700s, we have capacity offsets with planned Classic and 717 retirements. And currently, our capacity for the first quarter is expected at 2013 is expected to be relatively flat to slightly down year-over-year.","I will end with an update on the current status of our fleet modernization initiative. Back in January, you'll remember that we provided estimates for EBIT contribution over the next 3 years as a result of our fleet initiatives. Since then, we've made a few changes. We announced a $1 billion of deferral of capital spending in new airplanes. And most recently, we announced that we will sublease or lease all 88 of AirTran's 717s to Delta. Replacing AirTran's 717 flying with 737s as they transition to Delta is expected to benefit our annual pretax results by approximately $200 million after all of the 717s are transitioned to Delta and replaced with 737s flying.","The primary source to the benefits from a revenue contribution of more seats as a nominal trip cost of the 717 compared to our 737s is approximately the same. And as a result of this opportunity to retire the 717s from our fleet earlier than the head lease obligations, we have made adjustments to our retirement schedule of our Classic fleet to be able to replace the 717s flying as they transition to Delta.","Because we're replacing the 717 flying with adjustments to our Classic retirement schedule, this agreement does not increase our near-term capital spending plans for future aircraft needs.","Collectively, the 717 deal and the aircraft deferrals announced in May have not changed our EBIT estimates for 2012 through 2014, which were $70 million in '12, more than $300 million in 2013 and more than $500 million in 2014.","For 2015, however, we're expecting that the EBIT contribution from our fleet initiatives will exceed $700 million, and the $200 million increase in 2015 is largely the result of the replaced 717s line.","Overall, the improvement in EBIT by replacing the 717s with 7-3s coupled with the reduction in our invested capital that comes from the aircraft deferrals as well as the early retirement of the 717 leases, significantly improves the return on investment of the collective fleet modernization plan.","In the third quarter, we expect to record an accounting charge of approximately $140 million. It's primarily associated with the costs that were contractually assumed by Southwest to convert the AirTran aircraft to Delta's labor and  configuration. The charge will be included in our AirTran acquisition an integration costs, which are treated as non-GAAP special items.","With respect to these aircraft transition costs, we expect to only spend approximately $100 million in net costs. And the difference between that expected $100 million net costs and the $140 million GAAP third quarter special charge is a result of financial assistance that is being provided by the manufacturer that will be recorded on our financial statements as a reduction in aircraft basis on future deliveries.","The $100 million of net conversion costs are about $50 million higher than we expected to incur if we would've integrated the 717s directly into Southwest. So as a result, this will increase our estimate of total acquisition and integration costs from $500 million to approximately $550 million.","In regards to the net rent expense, as aircraft are transitioned from Southwest the Delta, our book rental expenses is eliminated, and the sublease income basically offsets that.","So in summary, we're very excited about the opportunity to retire the 717s from the fleet early. And we're confident that the net economics of the transaction better support our strategic, our operational, as well as our financial goals.","And with that, Tom, I believe we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now begin with our first question from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on your comments about third quarter RASM likely being solid. It definitely helps put some boundaries on it to know it won't  exceed the second quarter, but I think investors are still a little bit confused at how to interpret it, just given the tough comps throughout the quarter. If July isn't as good as June and comps get a lot tougher in August and then again in September, it seems possible that PRASM might go negative in September. Is this the sort of ramp throughout the quarter that would be reasonable? Or am I missing something about how the months shape up from here?","Laura H. Wright","Yes, I think -- I'm looking for the comps, John. But certainly we think July, the fact that we had July 4 on a Wednesday produces a tougher year-over-year comp than what we expect in August and September. I think we also have July, as you say, a very optimal month, and I think we've noted in the past that some of the suboptimal months, and we just have more room to grow revenues than we do in the peak periods like July. But overall, our bookings for the quarter look solid, and we don't see anything for August or September. But I would admit that July is impacted by Fourth of July.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And Gary, when we think about Southwest historically, capacity growth demand stimulation, solid returns have gone hand-in-hand. But as you've gone through this tougher phase here, the answer has been still in capacity growth until returns improve, and that makes sense. But as we look forward, and you mentioned that you're going to keep 2013 capacity flat, is the flat or minimal capacity growth the sort of new normal? Or do you envision getting back to a world where you see capacity growth, demand stimulation as again sort of aligned with maintaining solid returns from here?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, we definitely have some opportunities to stimulate demand. But I think that it will be perhaps a bit more tactical in the future than it has been in the past. And also, it has to be at a revenue production level that hits our 15% return requirement. So I think step one is just restoring our profitability to those levels, number one. Number two is to make sure that we have the capabilities in place to pursue expansion opportunities, which we are doing, that's adding the 737-800, that's investing in international capabilities, those kinds of activities. We'll have access to airplanes to be able to grow the airline. So all of those necessary pieces will be in place. And then it's just a matter of, again, making tactical decisions about what new markets we might want to add. Because it's tactical, I think we just have to wait and see when we're ready to add aircraft, what opportunities are available, and that'll be a function of capacity in the market and the price in the market. So Bob Jordan and I both highlighted Houston Hobby and the international opportunity there, which is a perfect example to your question. I'm hopeful that we will be hitting our return requirements so that we can add aircraft, because there is a significant opportunity to lower fares and grow the market in Houston Hobby internationally, as one example. And there are plenty more examples like that, but I think we just don't want to get the cart before the horse. So the first thing is we need to hit our profit targets, and then we'll be in the position to make those kind of choices.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","So my first question, Laura, is my usual Wright Amendment question. Can you just update us on the Wright Amendment revenues year-to-date? And then the other question that kind of goes along with that is I've noticed that some of your -- some of the other airlines are adding service to Love Field from their hubs using 50-passenger jets. So can you just talk about the opportunity that you have to -- as 2014 approaches, to do a lot of that service with larger aircraft and the potential for revenue benefit?","Laura H. Wright","Okay, I'll take the first one. So in the quarter, Wright Amendment revenue was $74 million. That was versus $63 million a year ago. Year-to-date, it's $1.34 billion versus the second quarter. So very strong. And Gary, I will let you talk about...","Gary C. Kelly","Well, Helane, I'll try to answer your question here. I think first of all, by federal law, Love Field will be limited to 20 gates. I guess it is limited now. But certainly, the new airport construction will be 20 gates. We have ample access to those 20 gates to support our operation. We'll be able to grow from here. We have a very strong business in Dallas, as Laura just reported to you. That is very nice growth in what is a pretty tough economic environment. So we're very pleased with our business here out of Dallas. We always take the competition seriously, but I think we would be delighted to compete head-to-head against regional jets every day. So in the grand scheme of things, our big competition out of Dallas is coming from DFW Airport, not Love Field.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan McKenzie with Rodman & Renshaw.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","Bob, I appreciate the AirTran commentary. But the one thing that stands out is the $2 million operating loss at AirTran. So it does look like roughly 15% of Southwest business is losing money, at least prior to the synergies. And I guess as I look at the operating costs, individual line items seem pretty much the same, if not better than AirTran's stand-alone historically. So...","Gary C. Kelly","Dan. Hey, Dan. Let me just interrupt you there. That is the 2011 required presentation. So that, first of all, that's not this year, that's last year. And I'll defer to Marcy as to what we'll have on our IR website for AirTran, if anything, separately. But we're having a harder time separating the profits between AirTran and Southwest as time goes by because they just -- they begin to blend more and more together. But again, I'll defer to Investor Relations over the next several days or weeks. But there was a significant operating profit from AirTran in the second quarter, that's fact number one. Of the $485 million operating profit, which was an all-time record, x items, I don't recall off the top of my head, but as Bob Jordan mentioned earlier, the operating margins at AirTran lags Southwest's margins some. But they're not far off. So they were a substantial portion of that $485 million.","Robert E. Jordan","And they're better year-over-year.","Gary C. Kelly","And they're better year-over-year.","Robert E. Jordan","There's progress along the way here.","Gary C. Kelly","So I apologize for the misinterpretation there, but the -- but that was a 2011 chart that was required at the time for combining financial statements. I think it's because it was split between -- there was AirTran standalone for a month and Southwest owned it for 2 months, and that's the only reason that's in there. But I agree with you that it is somewhat confusing.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So thank you for clarifying that, and I apologize for the confusion on my part. And then I guess if I could just ask the -- my next question. If I can just focus on productivity, perhaps a little differently than what's stated in the press release. I didn't see block hour stats in the press release. So I guess I'm wondering, first, what that average block hour time was in the second quarter? And then how does that compare to second quarter block hour time historically? And if you can just talk a little bit about the potential productivity improvements there?","Gary C. Kelly","Well for the most part, our utilization is still very high and especially in relation to prior years. Since 2007, we've concentrated more of the flying into the meat of the day, sort of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. And the block hours per day are down somewhat year-over-year, but I think that probably suggests, Laura, that maybe we have some opportunities to add more flights outside of the mean part or the meaty part of the day. But...","Laura H. Wright","Yes, and then there's [ph] 2Q '12 11 hours and 24 minutes was the block time average for the quarter. Last year was 11.41, but at '10, it was 11.11, so it's some. And I think we peaked at around 11.50 back in '07. So it's still very, very high.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us an update on the Evolve project, how many aircraft have been completed and the rate at which you're converting those over and when you think that's done?","Laura H. Wright","We can do that, Duane. We have 50 converted through June. We expect to convert about 200 more, about 100 in the third quarter and 100 in the fourth quarter. And we will be done in the second quarter of 2013 with all of the 700s.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just on fuel efficiency, I guess, as we think about whatever that line is in the model, ASMs per gallon, it kind of feels like that should accelerate a bit as you do this Evolve program and as you layer in more of these 800s. Can you give us any sense for the sort of year-to-year gains we can expect going forward?","Laura H. Wright","When you're talking about the fuel efficiency and all the economics, we haven't provided anything in 2013. As you know, the Evolve seats we're actually expensing. They're not being capitalized, so that's actually adding to some of the cost pressure and why you're not seeing net improvement in the 2013 time  frame. But certainly \u2013 or 2012 time frame. But certainly as we get into 2013, we have the majority of the fleet, we'll see some nice gains on the fuel efficiency and just the overall CASM from those, but we haven't provided any 2013 guidance yet.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in, could you clarify your comment about capacity growth next year?","Laura H. Wright","Yes. So we expect capacity growth in 2013 to be modest. That's going to become as a result of the extra seats from the 800 and Evolve. First quarter will be flat to relatively down, but full year will be a modest increase.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess 2 quick ones. Back to capacity growth, Laura, you gave us next year. Did you give us the third and fourth quarter of this year?","Laura H. Wright","I did not. I think I told you that for the full year we're going to be relatively flat with last year.","Gary C. Kelly","I think we reached down about 1 point, 1 percentage point. So we're down about 1 point, Mike, here in this second quarter. I think it's pretty...","Robert E. Jordan","1.2, I think.","Laura H. Wright","Yes, 1.2, I think there.","Gary C. Kelly","Pretty consistent in the third and fourth quarter.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, good. And then my second question. On the $1 billion of CapEx that you saved 2012 to 2014, Laura, how does that break out per year? Is it evenly across the 3 years or is it front-end loaded?","Laura H. Wright","No, it's actually weighted towards 2013 and 2014. The 2012 estimates are about $1.3 billion, so it was modest, but the real difference is in '13 and '14. Right now, '13 is 1 to 1.1, and that had been in the 1.4 rate so it's definitely the next 2 years when you see most of it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ray Neidl with the Maxim Group.","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Gary, I think you said on CNBC this morning that your ROIC goal is 15%. You've stated that previously. And I'm just wondering the components of that. It looks like it's coming from cost reductions, reconfiguration of your aircraft, resuming growth, which you're not doing for the next 3 or 4 quarters. So relatively speaking, is that a goal that's well beyond the year 2013, in other words, about 1.5 years out or more?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, we're -- the 12 months ended June of '12, we hit an 8% return on invested capital, I believe that's in the press release. This quarter, if you annualize the second quarter, it would be over 15%. And that's not my prediction for the next 4 quarters. But it just at least puts in perspective the kind of progress that we've made towards that goal. If we can sustain the current core earnings and then drive the values that we're targeting from the AirTran acquisition from the All-New Rapid Rewards rollout, the fleet initiatives, I think the way Laura categorizes those in her mind probably includes the 800s. Sometimes, I separate them in my own mind. But in any event that the -- what we have detailed for you in the press release shows very significant pretax earnings contributions coming from this collection of fleet initiatives, 800s, the Evolve, the swapping of the 717s in favor of 737s, and I already said Evolve. And by the way, we -- back to Duane's earlier question, we will likely retrofit 100 of our Classic aircraft with Evolve seating as well. But that won't meet the time line that Laura shared earlier. So all told, those more than take us from our current levels to the 15% returns. So we've got a very nice portfolio of opportunities that will bring very significant value. And with respect to your specific point about 2013, whether it's well beyond 2013, I don't think we're prepared to say at all that we won't hit our target next year.","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. That's good to hear. One other macro question, Gary. The industry is probably going to change here with the American bankruptcy, one way or the other. And is that going to have any effect at all or a major effect on Southwest if one, American comes at a bankruptcy to begin with, and if they did merge with U.S. Airways, they might become a larger, more aggressive competitor?","Gary C. Kelly","And just to tie-in again, Ray, on your 15% question, we've had a 15% target for 25 years. So that has -- I don't see that changing. So there's nothing new about that. On American, I think we agree with you that certainly, what we have to plan for is a much stronger, much more viable, much more cost effective competitor in the future. The old American is gone, and it will be replaced by something. So we agree with you. So we're gearing for stronger competition in the future. And that certainly provides the kind of discipline that we need to keep our costs low and our service levels high. Whether the reorganization of American results in some kind of opportunities for us, that's pure speculation right now on our part. But just like we were able to move very quickly to pick up a couple of slots at Washington Reagan, we know what we want to do with the airline over the next 5 to 10 years. And I think we've got the horsepower to move. And as some opportunities present themselves, I think we can decide and move quickly.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","From the time you announced the merger, my assumption was that the product AirTran was at the time would eventually become the product that Southwest is today. Basically, the Southwest way would prevail in terms of the passenger experience, single fleet type, IT, pricing and so forth. I'm curious now that you have a more thorough understanding of AirTran's operations and procedures, is there anything that they did better or different than Southwest that might actually continue? It could be as simple as red eye flying, for example, or maybe something much deeper than that? Any thoughts?","Gary C. Kelly","And just so I don't confuse anyone, our plan for integrating AirTran is unchanged from what you initially described. In other words, we will follow through with moving all of the AirTran operations into Southwest Airlines with the product that you know and love today at Southwest Airlines. Absolutely, we've learned a lot from AirTran. I think they do operate differently, and they are an outstanding operator. I mean, they have very strong on-time performance, outstanding baggage handling, and they have a different method of scheduling than we do. And they manage their fuel loads different than we do. So there's a number of things that are still queued up for us, I would say, as opportunities to continue to explore. We don't like to make massive changes to our operating procedures. Safety is our top priority. We want to make sure that people are fully trained and before we undertake a very large change there, we're very measured and very reasoned about how we go about that. But those are a couple of items that I'm very excited about that I think over time, Bob Jordan and Mike Van de Ven have been looking at and some things I'm sure we will implement. The biggest value I think that they have brought to us besides just seeing how another company works is international. Because our ability to research international fares and profits is much -- as you know, is much more difficult than what we're able to do domestically. So this gives us not only just the operating expertise and experience. And we admit, at Southwest we're novices to this, so get that from AirTran. And in addition to that, we get very meaningful insight into those international markets. And of course, these are markets that are expansion opportunities for us. So all of that is really invaluable. But they're very fine people, and they're very excited to be joining Southwest Airlines. We've added a lot of former AirTran folks into our leadership team. And again, I can't say enough of good things about our AirTran family members. They're doing a great job.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. And a quick follow up for Laura. I'll recheck my notes related to last year's FAA shutdown. Do you disclose what the estimated third quarter benefit was? It's fairly easy to compute what your net benefit was for that -- at that time. But of course, not all the revenue fell all at 1. it was spread across 2 quarters.","Laura H. Wright","And I'll let Marcy correct me, but I believe the July benefit was $36 million last year. So again, I think going back to John's question earlier, that could be playing into some of the comps year-over-year in July as well. But...","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And do you have an August and September figure, since revenue recognition would have affected those months as well?","Laura H. Wright","We disclosed those, so Marcy Brand will follow up later.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First question is does -- I understand the -- out of the $700 million, $200 million is coming from the 717 transition. Could you break out the $500 million between the 6-seat and the 800 transition?","Laura H. Wright","I don't know if we've broken it out, Savi, but what we have disclosed is with the Evolve, the 6 extra seats, that's conservatively a couple of hundred million a year. This from some pretty easy math on that. You've got the benefits of the 800s and the Classics being retired, that would really make up. All 3 of those together make up the $500 million.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you provide what EarlyBird and the Pets and Unaccompanied were in the second quarter, as well as what those 2 end businesses were like in the first quarter?","Laura H. Wright","You bet. So in the second quarter, our EarlyBird was $40 million, that was up from $36 million last year. I'll get your first quarter in a minute. Pets, UMs and excess bag charges were $19 million, that was slightly different, Southwest against standalone, that was equal to last year. And I don't know if I have 1Q in front of me. Again, I think that's something we can follow up with you. Marcy Brand will give you a call.","Operator","And we'll go next to Glenn Engel with Bank of America.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. First on the 737 Classics, now, that you're pushing out the retirement of those, does that mean that maintenance is going to remain elevated for a few years?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, let me just -- while Laura is thinking about your maintenance question, just to clarify, we had an original useful life plan for our Classics. We accelerated the retirement of those. Then when we reached the -- in our planning, then when we reached the deal for the 717s, we pushed some of the accelerated retirement dates back a bit. But they're still earlier than what they would have been had we kept them the entire useful life. So I don't know that that's meaningful to your question. But...","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That tells me the depreciation impact that you talked about earlier in the year will be somewhat less than you previously said.","Gary C. Kelly","Yes, there's just a lot of things that are going on in our fleet estimates and retirement dates, and then are we going to have a 717 deal. So I think all that now is finally settled, and Laura has also updated salvage values and just a number of things related to all of the depreciation charges. But on the maintenance...","Laura H. Wright","Yes, and so what I'm going to say to Gary's point, some airplanes still aren't accelerated somewhat. We have 40 Classics retiring this year, which is a significant number. So we do expect to see benefit. But all in all, when we look at the total operating costs of the 717 on a nominal basis compared to our 737s, when you look at ownership, maintenance, all the operating costs, they're about the same. So when you think of it that way, we're not expecting to see maintenance increase as a result of this deal. And we'll still get the benefit of the Classics that have been accelerated from where they were.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So the current level of maintenance cost for ASM is something that's a good steady-state number?","Laura H. Wright","You're looking out for 2013 and beyond?","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Laura H. Wright","Yes, we will give guidance on that for our 2013 plan. But certainly, with our fleet plan, we expect to see improvements over time with the acceleration of both the 717s and the Classics.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So tax rate was relatively low in the June quarter, what will the tax rate be now for 2012?","Laura H. Wright","Yes, Glenn, it was 38% in the quarter, and we expect it to be in that 38% to 48% range for the full year.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Why would it pop back up? Why wouldn't it stay down to 38%?","Laura H. Wright","It all depends on what your nondeductible items are, as well as just what your full-year PBT [ph] is. So that's why we are giving you a range. But certainly, a 38% range is reasonable.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And finally, the headcount was up over 5% year-over-year in the June quarter, with capacity being down. Why? What's driving that and when will that reverse?","Gary C. Kelly","I think that's -- the same question, same answer that we've discussed perhaps as early as in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We had -- first of all, we introduced a new frequent flyer program that simply required more support at our call centers. Now as that -- we actually have seen our calls offered this year compared to last year come down substantially. So I think some of the pressure that we had in our call centers is already behind us. The other thing that we are always trying to manage, Glenn, is just the right balance of staffing and overtime and other forms of premium pay. Last year, I felt like it was a little bit pushed too hard, and we had too much premium pay. So we have allowed for some of our staffing to increase in operating groups across the company, primarily in the call centers, by the way. But the overtime and the premium pay and all of those categories are down substantially, and the overall unit costs performance in salaries, wages and benefits was quite good in the quarter, as an example. So I don't expect our staffing to continue to increase. It has slowed to a crawl, if anything, for all the reasons that you pointed out. So now, all we're doing is simply trying to optimize the cost and the service levels, understanding that we're trying to keep our fleet roughly flat and more importantly, our trips and capacity roughly flat.","Laura H. Wright","And Glenn, I was going to add to that is on the AirTran side, Southwest is doing all of the ground service AirTran had outsourced previously in the stations that we both -- and we're doing that much more cost effectively, but it does mean we have more heads than we had on a combined basis.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So a question, Laura, just to follow up on the CASM x fuel commentary for the third quarter. You said mid to high single digits but that was, I guess, you said excluding profit-sharing. So assuming you have in higher profit on an absolute basis, which looks like it's going to be the case. Should we expect that CASM x fuel off the 7.39 number to be actually closer to straight up high single digits? Am I thinking about properly?","Laura H. Wright","I think that's probably reasonable. Let me just walk you through, Hunter, some of the items just so you can understand where the costs are coming from. But to your point, 2Q on a CASM x fuel, it was up 4.3, it was 2.7 with our profit-sharing, just to put that in perspective. And what we've got in the half of the year is I think Dan asked a question on Evolve. We've got 50 airplanes that were down in the first 6 months. I think it was maybe only 40. And we've got 100 per quarter in each of the third and fourth quarters. So that's going to be expensed, and that's going to put more pressure on our maintenance expense in the third and fourth. But high return on investment on that. On the airports, we've got some really nice credits that happen to hit in the second quarter. So all in all if you look at our airport costs for the year, they make sense. But first half is coming in lower. We are having some adjustments on our depreciation and ownership as a result of the myriad of things going on in the fleet side that are going to hit the back half of the year. And advertising is the other item where we significantly underspend on advertising and deferred a lot of that. So again, that's an investment that's going to hit in the back half of the year.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And as you think about the buybacks, you guys got very aggressive on this on your announcement, which I think a lot of the people appreciate. But how -- can you maybe give us some sense for the timing of those buybacks during the quarter? Sort of obviously, there's quiet periods or blackout periods that you can't buy the stock, and how should we think about how you think about timing future buybacks? Do you try to get opportunistic pullbacks, or is it more sort of systematic, methodical approach? Just anything in that area will be great.","Gary C. Kelly","I don't think we can give you any answers to those questions. I think first of all, we're managing the business and in particular, our operating cash flow. Secondly, we want to manage our operating cash flow in such a way that it drives free cash flow. So it will have -- we'll be thinking about having an available amount of money that we want to provide to our shareholders. But that, again, that just depends upon the performance and the availability of that money. I think the other way to think about the share repurchase and the reason that the board did authorize an increase back in May is because we were anticipating that we would before the next board meeting, which is next week, that we would be completing the first authorization. And we certainly wanted to acknowledge to you and the rest of the market that we're still willing to be a buyer, given the circumstances that I described. But there is no deadline. We'll certainly give no pricing guidance or timing guidance whatsoever.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Our questions have been answered.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brand for any additional or closing remarks.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom, and as always, if anyone has follow-up questions, Gary and I are available. Thank you all for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Ginger Hardage, Senior Vice President of Culture and Communications.","Ginger Hardage","Right. Thanks so much. Now is the time we'd like to begin the media portion. So I now will queue up the questions for you all to be able to post those to Gary, Laura and Bob. So will you please give those instructions?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now begin with our first question from Matt Joyce with the Dallas Business Journal.","Matt Joyce","Matt here. I wanted to ask, Gary, what's your take on Spirit's expansion at DFW Airport and how it relates to the competitive feel for Southwest?","Gary C. Kelly","Gosh, Matt, I don't know that I have any particular reaction. Clearly, Spirit is one of just a very few airlines that are adding aircraft and expanding in this environment. And so we're mindful of that, and I don't know if you heard Laura's report earlier, but we're continuing to manage well, I think, out of Dallas Love Field and are looking forward to the day when all of our construction is complete over here and the Wright Amendment restrictions lapse. But Spirit is adding, they're adding airplanes and they're adding flights. And I think that's a fact. And they're a very, very fine airline, and we take that competition very seriously.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","I just wanted to ask for a clarification. I think there was something I didn't understand about why is it that the net conversion, aircraft conversion costs are increasing by $50 million?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, very simple: because the cost of converting the aircraft is going to be higher than what we would have spent on it. And for us to make a deal with Delta, we agreed to pay those conversion costs. I would just -- just to further explain, we just amazingly found a home for all 88 of those aircraft. And so you might think of it as a volume discount that we were willing to offer to induce our sublease customer here to take those aircraft. But that's all it means is that the cost of converting the aircraft is going to be more with this deal than what we thought it would be. And as to how we make that work, well again, Laura explained that the value that we get from not flying the 717s and instead flying the 737s is substantial. So it -- what -- we'll pay for that conversion cost in the first 6 months.","Kelly Yamanouchi","And when you say the cost of the deal is more than you thought it would be, you mean the AirTran acquisition, right?","Gary C. Kelly","No, I was saying the cost to convert an AirTran 717 into Southwest, we were going to spend $50 million. The cost to convert those over to Delta is going to cost $100 million. We're spending more money on the aircraft conversion, and there's also some modest accounting differences and subleasing the aircraft versus just using it ourselves. But the fact is, the Delta conversion cost is more than what the Southwest cost would have been.","Kelly Yamanouchi","Why is it not less if they're maintaining a front cabin?","Laura H. Wright","Kelly, it really comes down to their design for the spec of the airplane. So they're going to make more changes to the airplane than we would have.","Operator","We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles","I was wondering if you could give a little more commentary on your fares. It looks like airfares were up 5% for you guys to about $150 is your average fare for this quarter. Could you talk a bit more about the fare environment, and where you think it's going to be going heading into the fall travel season?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think it's a little bit too early to tell you what the fare environment looks like, at least for the second quarter until we get all the earning results. But I think we have some idea what the rest of the airline's revenue results for the quarter, and they were all pretty good. I think the airline business right now has adjusted to the state of the economy and higher fuel costs. So I don't see that -- but again, based on Laura and Laura's and my earlier report, we're looking for a solid third quarter. We have some distortions with the Fourth of July holiday following on a Wednesday that she commented on and, I don't know if you heard that, Andrea. But otherwise, I think our business looks like it's continuing along. What I said earlier I would just repeat, which is I think it's prudent to be cautious in this environment just given the state of affairs in the world and our domestic economy. But aside from those normal cautionary comments, our business is continuing to be strong. We have very full airplanes and at least no immediate threat of higher energy costs like what we were saying in the first quarter, that seems to have steadied. I won't agree that these lower energy costs, which I heard some commentary earlier this morning on. They're not low. They're very high. But at least there's steady. And when we've adjusted our business to these levels of fuel costs.","Robert E. Jordan","And Andrea, if I can add one thing -- this is Bob. As Gary noted about just a little bit of caution, I think the second quarter for the first time in a long time was the first quarter where we had no domestic fare increases as an industry that stuck. So that gives you a little view into how the industry, I think, is thinking about the pricing power and all that. So that's a little bit unusual that we did not have any fare increases pushed through in the second quarter.","Andrea Ahles","Gary, you mentioned lower energy costs with the way you guys are being penalized for your fuel hedging contracts right now because oil has kind of stayed down and is not as high as had originally been anticipated. Will that change your approach to fuel hedging contracts in the future since you continue to see sort of a negative impact from those contracts?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, Andrea, sorry, I had the same reaction. Fuel costs aren't low, and we're not seeing any significant penalty for fuel hedging. Fuel hedging, by definition, is an insurance program. And best case is we spend some money on that coverage and never have to use it. So we had -- I think our folks have done a marvelous job of managing our fuel hedge position. There was a $0.03 penalty in the quarter, if you want to call it that...","Laura H. Wright","$0.04","Gary C. Kelly","$0.04. And that's -- we have positioned the fuel hedge this year to allow for declining prices and for the most part, our folks have participated with all of the reduction in fuel prices. With respect to our program going forward, we're about 30% hedged in the second half of this year, close to 60% hedged next year, about 50% in 2014. We've got positions in '15 and '16, all that is in our press release. So no, we'll continue to be very active in fuel hedging because if you don't have the protection in place, it's an enterprise risk. So it's really just that simple. So then the challenge for our folks is trying to spend an appropriate amount on the program that doesn't penalize the company. We spent less money on fuel hedging in 2012 than we have over the last couple of years. And again, I feel very good about our fuel hedging program. We have substantial protection in place when fuel prices go back up, as they certainly will.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Hardage for any additional or closing remarks.","Ginger Hardage","Well, thank you again for participating today. If you think of any additional questions you might have from the media, don't hesitate to call (214)792-4847 and we'll get those additional answers for you. But thank you so much for calling in today.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for joining."],"19556":["Southwest Airlines Co.

We're about to begin. Welcome to the Southwest Airlines Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. My name is Tom, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. Hello everyone. And welcome to today's call to discuss our second quarter 2015 results. On the call today, we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President, and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President of Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ron Ricks, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer.","Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements and because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary Kelly","Thank you, Marcy and thanks everyone for joining us for our second quarter 2015 earnings call. We had an outstanding quarter. We are looking forward to another strong revenue performance in the third quarter, at least from our current perspective.","I want to start by paying tribute to [indiscernible] due, which is to all of our 47,000 employees. These are the terrific results. They work very hard to deliver them. They've also worked very hard to build Southwest Airlines and of course, they work hard every day to serve our customers and each other. They're superb and these results are test of that.","It's no secret that this was eagerly an all-time the quarterly record. Last 12 months return on the invested capital is all above \u2013 a record. You have to go all the way back to 1980, which was a 29.2% performance. Fuel prices were down 33% to a little over $2 a gallon and of course that was a huge driver in our year-over-year earnings increase. And we assume the fuel prices will continue to be moderate for at least the next several quarters and hopefully long after that.","Our revenue production was very solid and especially considering our softer economy than we were planning for, and also considering the industry's growth and seats and our own 7% available seat mile growth. Our traffic was strong. We had a record load factors. Our passengers grew 5.6%, which outpaced easily our modest 2% seat growth. Our unit revenue comparisons year-over-year is somewhat deceiving.","Our RASM declined 4.7%, but a point of that is attributable to a year ago $47 million accounting estimate change. In addition to that, there was a 2.6% effect for increased stage length engaged. So if you take all that into account, it really leaves a year-over-year decline of only about a little over 1% due to the somewhat softer demand or softer economy. We have a large percentage of new markets or markets in development that's around 18%. This will decline as we go forward and especially into next year and almost all of the 7% capacity growth in second quarter was in Dallas, Washington Reagan and LaGuardia and a small amount in some new international markets. Dallas alone was up 150% year-over-year.","Its load factors and profit margins and return on invested capital, all exceed system average. And in that statistic I'm talking about the new Dallas markets not just Dallas in total. In Dallas we've lowered fares, we've added flights, we've stimulated demand and we've created meaningful competition for the first time in decades, which is exactly what we said that we were going to do. We've added capacity in the second quarter in other domestic markets, but those have essentially been funded by cuts in other preexisting markets that we had served.","So looking ahead, we are delighted to announce this morning an amendment, an exertion of our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. They are absolutely a terrific partner. You've heard a lot about our strategic initiatives over last five years and in particular our all new rapid rewards program. So this updated deal is a testament to the enormous success of our new program and the new Chase deal amounts to what is a stealth fixed initiative or at least an extension of the current all the rapid rewards.","So as we reported this morning with our release we'll recognize an additional $250 million in revenue for the second half, which will continue on in future quarters and then of course, we'll also recognize an additional onetime benefit in July of $150 million. So with that, along with some improvement that we've noted in our core business, our sequential revenue trends will improve significantly from second quarter to third quarter.","So, this is an interesting year for us. We have the AirTran integration behind us. We're continuing to optimize the large number of converted or we call them developing markets. Secondly, we're following through with the secular opportunity to expand Love Field. Third, we're seeing the full year effect of our significant expansion in Washington Reagan and LaGuardia, as a consequence of buying slots from American upon their merger with U.S. Airways.","We're following through gradually with our commitment to launch Southwest international service in July of last year and follow through with the launch of new international service in Houston at Hobby for the first time since the 1960s. And it has Love Field like opportunities to lower fares, add flights and stimulate the market. Obviously, the scale there is much, much smaller and admittedly the risk is greater. So we'll take all of that into account with our expansion plans.","We're also gradually returning aircraft from an out of service state to an in service state, as the integration of the AirTran fleet or its replacement fully completes. So we're able to grow this year without adding any net aircraft. And again start the year with around 700 units, so we planned in the year at about 700 units.","For next year, our fleet plans are unchanged. Tammy will give you some updates as to some of the pluses and minuses within that, but we're still targeting to grow the fleet around 2%. Our ASM plans which of course are always available seat mile capacity plans, which are always subject to change for next year, will be at least 5% and that's driven almost all by 2015's growth but no more than 6% and again that's all based on our current outlook.","And I would just summarize all of those thoughts by just reminding everybody that we will very carefully manage our growth so that we can sustain our operational excellence, our outstanding customer service, our strong profit margins and returns on capital and maintain our strong balance sheet. And I believe in our people and I'm confident in our ability to manage all those things, so Tammy with that quick overview I'll turn it over to you.","Tammy Romo","Thanks, Gary, and welcome everyone. We're very pleased to report all-time high quarterly earnings, excluding special items of $691 million or $1.03 per diluted share, which is a 43% increase from second quarter last year. Our GAAP net income was $608 million, including $83 million in special items. Second quarter operating income was a record $1.1 billion and our operating margin was a strong 22.5%. Our pre-tax margin grew by 6 points to 21.7% and our 12 months trailing pre-tax return on invested capital grew to 28.2%.","We've generated $1 billion of free cash flow for the first half of this year and in May we announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. During the second quarter we repurchased $380 million in shares and we announced today that we plan to launch another $500 million accelerated stocks repurchase program soon, which will bring our share repurchases this year to nearly $1.2 billion. Once the new ASR, accelerated share repurchase is launched, we will have completed more than half of our $1.5 billion repurchase authorization in just under three months time. We also announced a 25% increase in our divided in May. Our divided yield is currently just under 1%.","Revenues for the quarter were up 2% on a 7% capacity increase, and as Gary noted, we are extremely pleased with the development of our new markets which represented about 20% of our available seat miles.","Our second quarter results also benefited substantially from lower fuel prices and our continued focus on non-fuel costs, particularly our fleet modernization effort. Our economic fuel cost savings in second quarter were almost $500 million, and without fuels, our unit costs were flat year-over-year, and when you exclude the records, $182 million profit sharing earned by all of our hard-working employees this quarter, our unit cost decreased nearly 2% year-over-year.","And I would remind you all, that in order to fully understand our results you needed to keep in mind the impact of the increased stage land engaged to both revenue and cost. I'll take you through our revenues and cost in more detail, but the takeaway is that our network is producing strong margins and returns with or without the help of fuel.","I'd like to congratulate all of our hard working employees on these exceptional second quarter results which marked our ninth quarter of consecutive record profitability. Diving more into revenues, we reported a record revenues of $5.1 billion. And on a unit basis, our passenger revenues were down 4.6%, which is right in line with guidance for the last couple of months.","Total revenue per available seat miles was also down in a similar range. And demand for our low fares remain very strong throughout the quarter, resulting in record load factors for each month and the full quarter. Aside from softer yields experienced in May and June, our second quarter year-over-year unit revenues were impacted roughly two points to three points from higher engage and flying longer distances.","As Gary walked you through the unusually high increase in stage engage is largely due to workforce in Dallas. Our year-over-year unit revenue comps were impacted by about a point from last year's revenue adjustment first privilege.","Our new markets are maturing in line with plan. Demand in our new Dallas markets, and particular has just been tremendous with load factors with over 90% for the quarter and margins exceeding a system average performance.","International is also developing as planned, which took into account the potential for us slower rate of ramp-up than a market like Dallas, which clearly had lots of pent-up demand for our legendary low fares.","Our Rapid Rewards programs, as Gary said, is a huge success and continues to contribute significantly with nearly $80 million in incremental revenue a year-over-year in the second quarter.","We're very pleased with the growth of our frequent flyer program, including the growth in the credit card program and we were thrilled to announce today that we recently amended and extended our credit card agreement with Chase. Terms of the agreement are confidential, however, the amended agreement includes improved economics over the life of the multi \u2013 what is a multi-year contract. For accounting purposes, this amendment triggers the requirements that follow the valuation methodology, prescribed by the 2009 update to the accounting standards versus the residual accounting methodology that we previously followed.","This new methodology will put us on a more comparative accounting method to the industry. The effect of the amended contract and applying the new accounting methodology, is that we will be able to accelerate a portion of our revenue \u2013 revenue recognition associated with point sold to take.","In addition, under the new accounting methodology and amended agreement, we will allocate a portion of the revenues to other revenue first as the 100% being allocated to passenger revenues, as has been the case over the past couple of years.","As a result of the new accounting methodology, our year-over-year comparisons on PRASM will be distorted for at least a year's time, and the more relevant measure of our unit revenue performance would be RASM. With this in mind, we are a providing a RASM guidance for third quarter 2015, and we'll provide updates to our third quarter RASM outlook in our monthly traffic releases.","And we'll continue to evaluate whether this will remain our practice beyond this quarter. Our preliminary estimate of the year-over-over benefit from the amended agreement, combined with the effect of the new accounting methodology is approximately $400 million and for the second half of 2015. Included in that $400 million is approximately $150 million that will be recorded in third quarter as a special revenue item.","And this will result \u2013 this will result from the deferred revenue liability being revalued using the current estimated selling price for transportation resulting in a liability rejection and corresponding non-cash one-time increase to GAAP operating revenues. As this amount will be recorded as a special revenue item, it will be excluded from our reported RASM and thus is excluded from our third quarter right RASM guidance today. However, as a reminder, when you're modeling a third quarter you will want to keep in mind the profit sharing impact of special items.","The remaining \u2013 approximately $250 million of the $400 million estimated impact to the second half of the year will benefit our reported unit revenues. Our preliminary estimate of the year-over-year benefit to each \u2013 third quarter and fourth quarter RASM is roughly two points to three points. One additional note is that in conjunction with our amended agreement with Chase, we are very excited to announce that we have also extended our long-term exclusive co-brand network agreement with FESA.","So with our Chase agreement and corresponding a change in accounting methodology in mind and based on our current bookings of revenue trends we are estimating third quarter RASM will decline approximately 1% year-over-year. And while the economic indicators have been somewhat mixed, the economy overall being fairly solid and our revenue trends appear to be stabilizing and improving. With or without the Chase related benefit, July is currently trending a better than average sequentially and third quarter is also trending at sequentially from the second quarter.","Overall, considering the estimated 2 percentage point impact of more stage and gauge, as well as our estimated 18% of our network under developments, we are very pleased with our third quarter revenue outlook.","So turning to freight and other revenues, we are also pleased with our performance there. We currently expect third quarter 2015 freight revenues to be comparable to second quarter 2015. Other revenues declined slightly year-over-year from the elimination of AirTran fees with the integration completed in December last year. This was largely offset by continued strength and certain ancillary revenues such as EarlyBird Check-in and upgraded boarding. So a very good performance there.","And other ancillary revenues were approximately $46 million. We expect third quarter 2015 other revenues to increase significantly from third quarter 2014, due to the change in accounting methodology I just walked you through regarding fee amended Chase agreements.","So now, I will turn to our cost performance. Our second quarter unit costs, excluding special items decreased 12% on a year-over-year basis due to lower fuel prices, big cost control, fleet modernization and improved aircraft utilization. Our economic fuel costs were $400 million lower year-over-year, largely driven by a 33% decline of fuel prices and approximately 2% improvement in fuel burns.","We are expecting a significant fuel savings again in third quarter, relative to a year ago and based on our hedge position and market prices as of Monday, we expect our third quarter fuel price per gallon to be at approximately $2.20, which is well below third quarter last year's $2.94. We made adjustments to our hedge book last fall, as you might remember when crude prices collapsed and we continue to actively manage our hedge book to balance exposure, with our desire to have some upside protection. Since last fall, we participated in the vast majority of the market decline and we currently expect our total 2015 economic fuel cost to decline approximately $1.3 billion from last year.","And on the non-fuel cost side, excluding our special items of fuel, our unit costs were comparable year-over-year. Again this includes a 43% year-over-year increase in profit sharing. Excluding profit sharing and special items, our non-fuel unit cost decreased 1.8% year-over-year, driven largely by the fleet monetization benefit. Maintenance unit cost declined 4% year-over-year and our aircraft rental unit cost declined 27%, primarily due to the retirement of the 717 fleet.","So, based on our current cost trends, we expect total third quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing to decrease year-over-year approximately 1%. And I'll note that we are still on track for full year 2015 unit cost, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing to decrease approximately 2% year-over-year.","Moving now to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and our operating cash flows for the first half of 2015 was $2.1 billion and our free cash flow was $1 billion of which we have returned approximately 80% to our shareholders thus far this year. Our balance sheet is strong with leverage of 33% including off balance sheet aircraft leases as of the end of the quarter and we continue to hold the distinction among U.S. airlines of having an investment grade rated balance sheet by all three rating agencies and we're very pleased to receive an upgrade by Moody's to BAA1 with a outlook positive during the quarter.","We continue to estimate our 2015 capital spend to be approximately $1.8 billion and that excludes assets constructive for others, which is estimated to be in the $50 million to $100 million range net and this includes as a reminder approximately $1.1 billion in aircraft spend. We're still finalizing our 2016 CapEx plans, but continue to estimate our aircraft spend will be in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range and total spend less than $2 billion. Overall our balance sheet and cash flows have remained strong throughout this year allowing us to continuing to invest in the business and return significant value to our shareholders, employees and customers.","And that brings me to a quick recap of our fleet plans, I \u2013 Gary went through pretty fully, but I won't go into too much detail here, because I'll just reference you back to the earnings release, but we \u2013 end of the quarter was 689 aircraft in our fleets, and at the end continued to expect our fleet to reach roughly at 700 by the end of this year.","Regarding capacity, our third quarter ASM are estimated to increase year-over-year approximately 8% on a year-over-year seat growth of 3.5%. For the full year, our 2015 capacity growth remains on pace to increase approximately 7% year-over-year and that's with seats growing just under 3% year-over-year. And again this year's plans are targeted largely on Dallas with a smaller portion of Washington Reagan, New York LaGuardia, international and other regional market opportunities.","Gary walked you through the annualized impact of our 2015 capacity additions which again will contribute approximately 4% to 5% of our 2016 year-over-year capacity. And with a continued focus on optimizing our network, we currently plan to grow our 2016 ASM and the 5% to 6% range versus 2015.","And as you think about our 2016 year-over-year ASM growth, keep in mind that the timing of our 2015 annualized growth will create a higher year-over-year rate of return, rate of growth in the first half of 2016 as compared to second half of 2016.","So in conclusion of these are very exciting times at Southwest, demand for our low fares and friendly service is strong, and we're delighted with the overall performance of our network. And in closing, we've received a lot of questions regarding our historic 15% pre-tax goals which we've acknowledged is too low with today's fuel prices.","Over the long run, our goal is to consistently deliver healthy profits and returns at or in excessive our cost to capital, which is currently under 8%. Given where we are today simply referring back to our historic goals is that meaningful and we will be providing annual financial goals of moving forward. In 2014, we delivered a strong 21.2% ROIC and for 2015 our goal is to exceed 21%. And we are well on our way to achieving that goal.","For the 12 months ended June 30, our pre-tax ROIC is 28.2%, which is almost 18% after-tax, and our current outlook for the second half of 2015 is strong. Well, it's too early to provide guidance for 2016. Again, our goal is to sustain health margins and returns on capital in line with 2015.","And with that overview, Tom, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for waiting. We'll now begin with our first question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora","Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, Tammy, just wanted to question around prepared remarks in terms of your revenue trending up sequentially, what is driving this? Is it better volumes or have you been able to push price more than you had been able to over the course of May and June? Thanks.","Gary Kelly","Sure. We are seeing some softness in our yields. But again, we are seeing that pickup and just continuation of healthy demand. So the economy feels pretty good now, and of course we're expecting a tremendous benefit from Chase and the accounting related to that new contract.","Andrew Didora","And then, if I could just follow up to that. I know corporate is a much smaller part of your business, but just curious in terms of what your corporate customers are telling you about potential future, future demand out of that channel and if you're seeing any sort of slowdown on the corporate side? Thanks.","Gary Kelly","Sure. Our corporate sales grew pretty much in line with capacity, and our business mix is still roughly a third of our passenger. So no meaningful change there. And when you factor in the mix of our development markets and just the trend set we had on the yield side in the second quarter, we're very pleased with those trends. Our corporate sales \u2013 again on the revenue side, also we saw a nice increase there year-over-year. And our \u2013 business mix continues to run in the low 30% range.","Tammy Romo","You can see some year-over-year declines in some of the oil patch, so I think that's pretty consistent with all the headlines that you would know, but Paul, I don't know if you have anything to add, I think the \u2013 I don't know in fairness to your question that corporate accounts are telling us anything, but if we just look at the recent trends I agree with everything Tammy said. I don't think you are necessarily hearing anything or...","Gary Kelly","No, I think the corporate business is in line with the base business generally as you mentioned we're seeing points of modest weakness that you would expect like oil and gas in some cases manufacturing related to that, but we're seeing offsetting points of strength like healthcare and consulting and other sectors, so net-net I think it's about a wash.","Tammy Romo","Yeah, Gary, on the \u2013 on the oil related roots I didn't note it in my remarks because all others is treated where there's an impact, it really hasn't been that significant, it's very strong.","Andrew Didora","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Tom Kim","Hi. Great. Thanks very much. Gary, can you just help me understand how you think about the mix between pricing and load factors? And I guess just beyond staging gauge, it does seem like pricing is generally softer, not necessarily weak but softer for your sales in the industry and I'm wondering you got load factors up, pricing isn't necessarily a softer cadence. I'm just wondering, how do you think about that balance?","Gary Kelly","Well, I want to be fair to your question. If you look at our reported results here for the second quarter and despite the fact that passenger tripplings are longer, the average fare is down as a fact. I mean you're right, average fares are actually down year-over-year, so there is \u2013 it's very competitive industry and some of that is of course a function of us adding capacity in new markets which are under development. So I think in terms of the way we think about it going forward, we want to be the low fare carrier. We are working hard to support that by being the low cost producer. So we love keeping our fares low and would prefer to have more for airplanes.","Our load factors are the highest in our history, and the differential between Southwest now and the legacy carriers is very small. So we like that and obviously if we can drive revenue through sources other than fares like our new Chase agreement, we're very, very pleased with that. So in the end, we just need to manage revenues, and it needs to provide a sufficient margin over our cost and hit our capital returns. So I think in that sense, we're somewhat agnostic, but perhaps biased towards higher loads and lower fares.","Tom Kim","I appreciate that color. Thank you Gary. And then just as a bigger picture question. Can you share like your thoughts about, you know the ability to sort of still expand the market. Do you think that there is still opportunity within the U.S. to be growing the overall demand pie?","Gary Kelly","Well, again, all politics are local. So I think it just depends on the market. I was asked earlier this morning about why the industry isn't expanding faster given oral prices. There were physical constraints in some places, Love Field is the perfect example, where you can't continue to grow all field. Reagan is another example. So you just have to go market-by-market.","As I think about Southwest Airlines, we have tactical opportunities to continue to grow our domestic market which is maturing every year. But we still interestingly enough have very exciting opportunities to do that. And frequencies to connect dots, I'll just highlight a recent one that we've done, which is Austin to St. Louis. And it makes perfect sense for us to do that, and it's off to a great start.","Memphis is another one that we've highlighted over the course of the last year. It was an AirTran city, we decided to open it on Southwest. We did not replicate the AirTran network, we plugged it in a way that we thought maybe more sense for Southwest, and we are doing game busters out of Memphis.","Contrast that now to what I would call pure expansion, which is as flying transporter and that's different. That's adding higher risk capacity to cities that don't know Southwest Airlines, unfortunately the ones we're adding right now are mostly dependent upon U.S. traffic, when we add a San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica as an example.","But nonetheless, that is a higher risk flight as compared to adding Dallas to Chicago. So we just have to do this from the bottoms up, it's not a top down exercise and it's a nice thing that we've reported consistently as if we have a significant number of very handsome and deep opportunities to continue to grow.","And then in most cases that means we're able to grow into a market and add some value by bringing lower fares. So how much stimulation is left in the U.S. overall, obviously a lot less here in 2015 than 20 years ago, but nonetheless you still have opportunities. I mean Dallas Love Field is the poster child, which is just an incredible success story. And there were a lot of critics that did not feel like there was much opportunity to grow and they were wrong. So we'll just look for those kinds of opportunities across the country and where they're available to us, we'll put in service, where they're not, we won't force it.","Tom Kim","Gary, thanks a lot for that detailed discussion.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey, good afternoon. So just a quick question on the hedging side, now that your \u2013 has anything changed on your side, is there what you're attempting to do with the hedges?","Gary Kelly","Yes. We did \u2013 I'll just walk you through what we've done since the third quarter \u2013 since the second quarter rather. So in the second quarter, if you recall the energy market, started to trend upwards. And with the decrease in the recount and increase in market demand, we were concerned market prices would continue to escalate. So we did add some positions for the second half of this year. But so far supply, as you know has continued to outlay demand which has depressed the market prices. So we're continuing to actively manage that.","So for the second half of the year, the guidance that we gave you for the third quarter, includes roughly $0.40 of losses per gallon, but that's embedded in the $2 estimate that we gave you for the quarter, so the $2.20 estimate. So, I'll just point you to, Savi, just as a reminder, really the best way to do help guide for our fuel prices is just using sensitivity and as always we've included that in the earnings release for you to help you along with your modeling. So, that's \u2013 so that's the change that we've made since second quarter, I think the last guidance that we gave you for the full year as a reminder when we unwound our hedges back when the market collapsed back in the fall, I think at that time we guided you to about $0.20 of penalty for the \u2013 for the quarter, we got out of way of that largely in the second half. So our penalties are a little bit greater here in the second half of this year. But on average, I've got \u2013 kind of $0.25 average in my head for the full year. So up a little bit from what we reported to you previously.","Tammy Romo","All right, and the only thing I would add Savi is that from a program strategy with prices lower and with a more comfortable cushion in our profit margin, and the \u2013 you just layer in the very expensive nature we're trying to hedge, I think it just argues to be less hedged if that's where you're headed as opposed to more hedged.","And I think we're mostly focused right now in working our current position off, burring that off in the most cost effective way. But we've got a \u2013 a business that's built for substantially higher energy prices, fortunately. And the direction of energy prices right now seems to be a bit clear than it was 90 days ago. That's always dangerous to think. We know our energy prices are going to go, so we don't. But at least for right now, we have to have a view, and then we have to have some kind of behavior accordingly. And right now that's what we're managing to.","Gary Kelly","Yeah, and Savi, just one last note and we're currently participating in a large percentage of the \u2013 to the downside here, here in third quarter, third quarter 2015. It's not as quick as we were, but it's still substantial and it's producing, yeah, fuel prices well below a year ago level?","Savi Syth","Great. That's all, very helpful. So, just on the \u2013 I'm assuming the 2016, has positioned [indiscernible] 2014, is that really maybe kind of balancing some of the locked in losses that you have in 2016?","Tammy Romo","That's our \u2013 we're still working on our 2016 and 2017 hedge book. And as Gary said our bias at this point is to lower jet fuel prices. So we're working to balance that as best as we can.","Savi Syth","Got it. And if I may ask one other question and not related to the hedging, on the 18% of markets under development. Could you remind me again like what the drag is on your revenues currently. And then maybe \u2013 you think a portion of that will continue next year as you continue to open your market. So what's the drag that we can look forward to maybe being eliminated next year?","Tammy Romo","Yes. So, for the drag for the second quarter just to help you out, I think we've reported back to you in the first quarter that it was 0.6 roughly and for the second quarter the drag was a little over 1%.","Savi Syth","All right. Great. Thank you very much.","Tammy Romo","You're welcome.","Gary Kelly","So you know it's \u2013 obviously it's pretty big number, but the other thing I would just reinforce to your question is we've shared great results for Dallas. And Dallas in other words is a whatever that revenue percentage is of our total. But Dallas would have been better. I think as the economy maybe stronger. So there \u2013 even though it's really good, even it has a drag. So I think that there is \u2013 if the economy improves, our markets develop obviously we're hopeful of some significant upside there. Can't promise that, but it's just common sense that tells you if you got these many new markets, that there \u2013 that they are creating some drag. So it's tough for us to estimate that but however you want to estimate is mine with me. But I think there is a pretty significant opportunity to improve here. And that's what we're going to be managing.","Savi Syth","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates-Stewart","Good afternoon. Tanks for taking my question. Tammy, any change in how you're planning to report PRASM, I noticed you didn't give the June actual unit revenue growth for traffic a few weeks ago and today you guided to a Q2 RASM instead of July PRASM as you normally would have done. So is there any change of thinking there?","Tammy Romo","Yes, Julie. You are stating in and out. But I think I got your question. But please redirect me if I'm not answering it fully. Yes, we are planning to change at least for the third quarter of what we're reporting and on monthly traffic releases. We're going to be providing you a updated guidance on PRASM for the full quarter and that's really due to the Chase agreement and that we just executed here this month. We provided you our estimates but there is some noise between passenger revenues and other.","We will be recognizing more of that revenue recognition in other that we have historically. So PRASM, year-over-year trends are not going to be all of that meaningful until we lap and that's when we get probably a year down the road. So at this point I just think it's more meaningful to provide you all our RASM that help you with your modeling. And so, we'll get through this quarter and then, we'll evaluate if we want to continue with that practice.","Julie Yates-Stewart","Okay. So just to clarify there'll be no monthly numbers given the...","Tammy Romo","There will be no monthly number, but we do intend to provide you if there are any updates to our third quarter guidance for the full quarter in other words.","Julie Yates-Stewart","Okay. Great. And then you filed your schedules through early march, when we file again your capacity plans little further out into 2016?","Gary Kelly","Our plan is to extend the schedule sort of as normal which would be, I'll say, about a month from now.","Julie Yates-Stewart","Okay. And that will be for few months?","Gary Kelly","That's right.","Julie Yates-Stewart","Okay. And then, just lastly on your goal of maintaining the 2015 ROIC levels in 2016, what are you assuming on fuel?","Tammy Romo","We haven't given you \u2013 we haven't given you our fuel numbers but I think using something we are looking at market numbers just like you are, but with or without fuel a year we are managing to \u2013 continue to deliver strong returns and very healthy returns above our cost of capital. So, we haven't really given you our forward yet for fuel for next year.","Gary Kelly","You know and duly in fairness to your question, it's a conceptual goal. So a change in fuel price assumptions this material is obviously going to impact what we would ultimately target as a number next year. But on a fuel constant basis is pretty easy to think about that we want to sustain the current level of operating margins from year-to-year or grow them, and then by implication we would want to sustain or grow our return on capital, what we ultimately adopt is the plan is going to be depended upon more variables than just fuel prices, but those are our goals.","Julie Yates-Stewart","Okay. Thanks, Gary.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hi, good afternoon. Tammy, just a housekeeping item, you quantify the Chase impact on the second half you also talk about it providing value over the life of the contract, I suppose that means that it does imply at least there's revenue upside associated to \u2013 to the relationship in 2016. Any additional color there?","Tammy Romo","Yes Jamie, if I'm tracking your question correctly, what we provided you is just the second \u2013 of the benefit for the second half this year. So if you annualize that \u2013 that should get you in the ballpark and again I'm talking about the $250 million of the $400 million.","Jamie Baker","Okay, that's helpful. Second question, considering you took a $55 million charge in the second quarter relative to ratification bonuses, is it safe to assume that your third quarter ex-fuel, ex-profit-sharing and CASM guide assumes the attendance ratified model?","Tammy Romo","Jamie, either way we're going to be roughly in the hunt of the guidance I gave you.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Tammy, you guys used to provide revenues [indiscernible] routes are you willing to do that still?","Tammy Romo","All right, no as well. Helane, we've start that and never we're not, it's a lot. It's tremendous. Right now, I definitely go.","Gary Kelly","Provide a delta","Tammy Romo","I know, I don't have the [indiscernible] Helane.","Helane Becker","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Tammy Romo","We're not providing that breakout.","Helane Becker","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, I think Gary you mentioned that, Houston was going to open the international terminal later this year. Do you have actually a date for that at this point?","Gary Kelly","We do and if I trust my memory to be correct, I believe it's October 15.","Helane Becker","Okay.","Gary Kelly","Now, we're constructing a five gate terminal and that is required for us to operate and that construction is right on schedule. So it's been a fantastic project, and we're obviously looking forward to launching service. We got to schedule produced, all those seats are out there for sale, what is included is also launch of service to belief and then Bob, I think in November you follow-up with the launch of Liberia, Costa Rica.","Helane Becker","It's great.","Gary Kelly","So it's very exciting for us and I think the potential of the terminal is roughly 25 daily departures and we are starting out much more modestly than that. And other airlines can use the gates, if at least, if they sign up to the lease. So but we're looking forward to it and we're on schedule with that.","Helane Becker","And then, can I just ask a question about the Dallas Keith. I think you guys have to buy actually the two gates from United that you're adding. And now delta, I guess it's kind of interloping on that one gate. So when you increase the schedule on August 9 to 180 flights, how will you accommodate those other 14 flights?","Gary Kelly","Well, you asked a very good question, as you always do. Yes, we are sub-leasing the gates that United is leasing directly from the city of Dallas. And we bid for those gates, we rewarded the bid, we obviously entered into a contract with United and we received the consent of the city of Dallas to proceed with that transaction and the approval of the Department of Justice.","When we add the flights that we, after paying good money for two gates, obviously we intend to use them and to their fullest and we have published our schedule, we'll move to 180 daily departures and to accommodate the court and its desire to maintain the status quo, we have extended I believe the term as a license, the delta to continue to operate their five daily departures and it will be difficult, because there is no room at those gates.","If we do find that there's room then we want that room. So in any event, we all know that, there is scarce capacity at Dallas Love Field, but that is the status of it. And we'll work hard to support the court and their review of what is a complex issue. We don't see it as complicated, but we've been dealing with it for 34 years, but that's the status.","Helane Becker","Okay, okay. Well, thinks very much. We'll look forward tomorrow's boot from the flight attendants.","Gary Kelly","Yes, indeed.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joseph Denardi with Stifel.","Joseph Denardi","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Gary, I just want to clarify on the ROIC target, is the plan to no longer provide a longer-term target and if so, why is the year-to-year the right way to hand this? And then is the business being run to kind of ex-deal to hold margins flat or to grow them, I think, there's obviously a difference between the two?","Tammy Romo","Well. I'm not sure how to answer your question.","Gary Kelly","I think, this is complicated. I think given the current fuel price environment in the current industry environment, we are generating a substantial shareholder value well and in excess of our long-term 15% target. I think Tammy's only point is it, in the short-term, it sort of renders the whole 15% discussion moved. Because we're not targeting down to 15%, we won't do that for the next year. And with a little bit of to get fortune here will be many, many years of above the average returns on the capital, which is what we're striving for. So last year, we had a 21.2% return on the invested capital and our goal for 2015 was to beat that and thus far we are well ahead of that.","So as we enter the fall, planning process for 2016, we will be straining to do the same thing again in 2016 to meet or beat or wherever we think we're going to end up here in 2015. We think that's the best way to grow shareholder value, if we can grow the business and on top of that grow the returns, it just provides very, very substantial shareholder returns. And that is our goal playing it simple.","If fuel prices double between here and next year, that will make that an unrealistic goal in the short-term. It took us obviously a number of years to get adjusted to $100 crude oil. So hopefully that won't happen. We're trying to take steps, so that we don't see that kind of a shock for fuel prices back to the hedging discussion. But our goal for next year will be to continue to sustain very strong returns on capital.","Joseph Denardi","Okay. And then Tammy, can you just give us what the no show fee revenue was in the quarter?","Tammy Romo","Sure. Just give me one minute before that. I'll come back, if we have another question.","Operator","We'll go ahead and move onto Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. Wanted to come back to an earlier question about better than sequential revenue trends or better than normal seasonality. I forget the exact term. Can you just walk us through that again ex the deal and maybe playback the second quarter.","Do you feel like there was yield softness and weakening closing yields. And if so when did that recover and is it something that you're seeing based on revenue that's booked in July or bookings for the rest of the quarter. Any additional commentary you can give us kind of excess to sort of accretive credit card deal would be great.","Gary Kelly","Well, let me know your comments Tammy, you clean all this up, but Duane I assume you've been on the call the entire time, I know it's a busy morning for you all, but the \u2013 where I netted down the second quarter was, there was \"softness\" for us to the extent of about 1%, whether its 2%, whether its zero, it sometimes is a little hard to tease out, because there is a lot of noise in Southwest Airlines in 2015, there is a lot of things going on, there is a lot of change. So we've tried to tease all that out.","The comps versus a year-ago in the second quarter, at least to me appeared to be harder versus 2014 than the third quarter. So you have that going on as well, but just pure sequentially, I think it was our feeling before the deal, that things were beginning to improve perhaps a little bit. I just don't feel like you can necessarily take that to the bank. So whatever improvement it is, I think is rather modest, and the majority of the improvements sequentially that we're reporting to you is the Chase deal.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay.","Gary Kelly","The good news in what \u2013 at least what I was trying to explain with my remarks, my opening remarks is that to the extent that there is some softness, it doesn't feel to us like it's getting softer still. If anything it feels like we've seen a bit of the bottom and things are beginning to improve.","But 90 days is a long time in our work. So a lot of things can change between now and September. But that's the way things feel right now and obviously the Chase \u2013 the Chase deal is pretty material. We've given you the numbers, so you can \u2013 you can do your own arithmetic if you want, but I think Tammy, you already said, it's $125 \u2013 $125 million a quarter. So you can kind of \u2013 I just can't do all the math, Duane, in my head, sitting here. Tammy anything do you want to add?","Tammy Romo","Yeah. Duane, the only thing just to give as I mentioned earlier that the third quarter is trending up. And if I had to, it's probably about a point sequentially from the second quarter. And we are \u2013 we're continuing to see a very strong demand as Gary mentioned for low fares. And thus far in July including the Chase benefit, I would say, our July RASM is trending pretty much aligned with the last year. So while, it's a little difficult to tease all this out, I think, it's fair to say there is \u2013 the way I'm thinking of it is, we had some bad with the yield weakness in the second quarter, but trends have stabilized and I think improving a bit, so.","Gary Kelly","Yeah. And again, so what I mean with a lot of noise and Tammy just said the same thing. These are all trends without us doing the deep analysis. So is our improvement because the economy is improving, is because our development markets are improving, is it Dallas, is it Washington Reagan, are we seeing more improvement in the international? All that has to be \u2013 it takes a while to understand and now we're talking about predicting trends in the future, where we don't have that in-depth understanding necessarily.","So, I think, it feels to me like the economy is strengthening a bit, we keep up with it just like you do, and all of the weekly reports that I see are all \u2013 they're mixed, they're continuing to be mixed. I just read one this morning before our call, and it was yet another mix to report on, on current trends. So, it could be that it's just our own developing markets are improving, which would be welcome also. But in any event, whatever it is we are definitely seeing an improvement in our sequential trends and certainly because of the Chase contract.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay. Thanks for that commentary.","Gary Kelly","And I was just going to jump in with the notion of revenue that was $18 million for the quarter.","Operator","And that does conclude the analyst Q&A portion of today's call. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Ms. Brand.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom and thank you all again for joining us today. And as always, I'll be available, if there are any follow up questions this afternoon.","Operator","And that does conclude the analyst portion of today's call. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin our media portion of today's call. I would like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President of Communications and Outreach.","Linda Rutherford","Good day everyone. Tom, if you could go ahead and give our members of the media instructions, on how to queue up for questions. We'll go ahead and get started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Ma'am. [Operator Instructions] And thank you for standing by. We'll take our first question from Terry Maxon with The Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxon","Afternoon, everybody.","Gary Kelly","Good afternoon, Terry.","Terry Maxon","Hey, Tammy set off of a great deal of excitement on May 19th when she gave the capacity estimates for your 2015 and 2016. Your numbers today instead of 7% to 8%, you're now at 7% for this year and 5% to 6% for this year instead of 6% to 7%. My question is, did you actually dial back capacity set more just a refinement of your estimates?","Tammy Romo","Hi, Terry. Yes. We will \u2013 I think, it's both really. We were always working on schedule as we look forward. And what we were simply dealing at that time I think we had our schedule out. And it was \u2013 I mean, simply reporting on the schedule that we had published at that time. And given the weakness that we saw in May and June and particularly on the yield, and as we're getting closer to publishing our schedule, we are dialing back our capacity a bit just based on \u2013 based on the trends that we saw on the yield side in the second quarter. And then also as we're getting \u2013 as we're thinking about next year, what we do know is that the carryover impact in this year's capacity is and the \u2013 for next year then the 4% to 5% range.","And then above that as we told you, we're expecting to grow 5% to 6%. So where we brought a lot here, over the past couple of years. So we want to certainly digest that growth, and as we're thinking about our international expansion, while what we're seeing so far is in line with expectations. It does take a little bit of what we're experiencing and it does take a little bit longer for those markets to mature. So we factor all of that in to our capacity plans and just based on our current outlook and where we're not \u2013 we dialed that back just a bit. But Terry, what I'd also point out to you at that time, we as always, we tweaked our schedule and react to the current business outlook.","Terry Maxon","All right.","Tammy Romo","The only thing I would add is \u2013 it's not really a macro discussion, it's really more of a bottoms up discussion. So we have airplanes that are available for us to put to work in the fleet, which is the source of our capacity increase really both years, 2015 and 2016. Although we're adding a few airplanes next year to the fleet. And as we were publishing the schedule, we have pushed the utilization in the first part of this year, which has squeezed some flights into what I'll describe as a non-peak time period and they are sometimes less than desirable flights. So there's some opportunities to cut those back as we are beginning to restore more and more aircraft back into flying. So we have some things going on like that. Secondly, and I mentioned this on the Analyst Call, our international is a true expansion and it carries risk. And so, our folks are monitoring very carefully the performance of those markets and we do not want to grow those new expansion markets too fast.","So those are \u2013 we're managing the business as opposed to reacting to the May 19 scenario and we want to continue to hear out strong profits, strong margins and grow the airline at the right pace, whether it's 5%, 6% or 7%, we'll figure out what that right pace is and we'll try to make that as dynamic as possible knowing that the airline is fairly set in concrete for a while. It's tough for us to turn it on a dime but we certainly are continuing to evaluate our opportunity of 2016 and haven't made final decisions about the capacity yet.","Terry Maxon","Okay.","Tammy Romo","Again products \u2013 Terry, one thought as well, because I think what you were referring to was the capacity for this year. It really \u2013 we're talking decimal point. In term","Terry Maxon","It's better to 10 points [indiscernible]","Tammy Romo","And so, it is a lot of attention for rounding.","Gary Kelly","2016 our thoughts have moved more. They've moved up, we've moved down, Mike Van de Ven has operating needs for some airplanes, so \u2013 we are not fully baked with our plans for 2016 yet, but those are the parameters that we're operating under.","Terry Maxon","Yeah, if the \u2013 on the capacity, I wondered further in fact you just rounded it a little bit differently, but when you're further out you are the vaguer the future is, but if I could follow up on our question that came up toward the end of the conference call with the analyst, the delta software situation, is it \u2013 do you anticipate operational issues once you do your August 9 and you've got 180 flights and there are five folded into one of your gates?","Gary Kelly","Well, it's not going to be easy and our people are planning as best they can and they will work really hard to serve our customers well, so I think it will be incumbent upon all parties to be cooperative and levelheaded but yeah it's going to be crowded.","Terry Maxon","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jack Nicas with Wall Street Journal.","Jack Nicas","Good afternoon folks.","Gary Kelly","Hi Jack.","Jack Nicas","So can I ask this question, the DOJ is investigating Southwest and three other large U.S. airlines for possible collision on capacity, so what is \u2013 what's your take on this probe and how are you cooperating?","Gary Kelly","Well, we're cooperating by doing what they told us to, so we're good at supplying information and we know how to do that and we're busy complying with that request. There has been a lot of talk and advice on and we don't want to continue to perpetuate that, but I'd \u2013 you'd have to ask the Department of Justice, what's actually [ph] spon their desire to investigate. But we're fully compliant, we compliant with all the anti-trust laws, and we compliant with all laws for that matter and certainly that with the Federal Securities Laws. At the same time, we are \u2013 if you go back to the Terry's question of Tammy in the May 19th conference, we're doing our best to be transparent with our investors and answer their questions. But our focus is on the Southwest Airlines and managing our business and would not commenting or making comments about our competitors.","Jack Nicas","Okay. Thanks. And one other quick follow-up. Some of, I guess some of the analysts that have been on this call before over the past several months have criticized the industry and in some cases the Southwest for growing too quickly. And there is concerns among the analysts, concerns among the investors that capacity growth has been too rapid and jet fuel has been fueling that. Obviously, you've got a unique situation with Dallas Love Field, but what's your response to that criticism that you may be fueling too rapid of the growth to be sustainable and we may be going back into this moving bus cycle of the airline industry?","Gary Kelly","It's incumbent upon us to manage our business. And Southwest Airlines has competitive strength and we want to take forward advantage of those. We're a low cost carrier. We have substantially lower cost than our legacy competitors do. And I think, what people miss is that, we have opportunities to grow that many of our competitors do not and Dallas Love Field is a perfect example of that. Houston Hobby International is another perfect example of that. So we have not grown Southwest Airlines in three or four years.","So we have a history of being prudent and measured and how we approach our business. And certainly, would want to continue that into the future. But we have opportunities to grow like we haven't had in years and we absolutely will grow this airline, that is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we have a fiduciary duty to create shareholder value and take care of our shareholders and as well as our employees for that matter and that's what we intend to do.","Jack Nicas","Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram.","Andrea Ahles","Hi, good afternoon.","Gary Kelly","Hi, Andrea.","Andrea Ahles","I was wondering, if you talk a little bit more about Love Field and you'd be mentioned in the comments that, it's the markets that are doing well and obviously you're adding more in August. You had previously said that Love were at load factors about 90% on some of those at Love Field. Are you still seeing that sort of yield or did the softness in May and June also affect Love Field. And do you \u2013 and also do you think fares are going start going up on some of those in the Dallas routes, that you've added in the past year post writ.","Gary Kelly","Andrea, I can report this. You're right, the things have changed since I told you that load factors at Love were 90%, they're now about 94%.","Andrea Ahles","Okay.","Gary Kelly","Very, very full and very, very popular and our folks are working very hard at Love Field and they're doing a great job. So I'm very pleased with the results, I can't talk about that, any future pricing as usual. But we've got very strong results, stimulated the market with lower fares, we provided a competition that we promised.","And I don't know how it could be any better. Well, I do know how it can be better. And hopefully, we'll be better soon, because we'll have even more access to our gates that we have paid for, so that we can add even more low fare flights. That would..","Tammy Romo","I'm sorry. Do you expect Houston to \u2013 do you expect to grow Houston as quickly you have Dallas in terms of that opportunity with the international base, once [indiscernible] in October or are you're going to be more measured because there is more risk with the international hub?","Gary Kelly","Not expect it to grow anywhere near as quickly. The potential is probably not \u2013 well, the potential is not nearly as great in terms of just sheer traffic and flights that you have compared to Dallas. But the theme is very similar, it is a market that is monopolized by one competitor with very high fares, and we will be able to go in finally and add some competition and significantly lower fares, and no doubt we'll simulate the market.","Now, it is one thing for us to add flights between Dallas and New York or Washington or Chicago, better cities that we currently serve where the customers know us. As opposed to Houston, where we're now going to be adding the lease, which is of not only a city, but a country that is not familiar with Southwest Airlines, and probably doesn't drive an equivalent amount of traffic to United States.","So the risk are different and we'll have to take that into account, and we will have more measured growth as an example with these international markets. Having said all that, we're still starting off with a nice bang. So I think we start off with nine daily departures, we're quickly adding a couple more this year. And we'll just continue to monitor the performance of those flights and evaluate whether we want to add more. Contrast that to Dallas Love Field and Bob, I think we will have added about 60 daily departures in one year \u2013 less than a year's time to Dallas. So we're not talking about 60 daily departures in Huston ever most likely, just to put in perspective.","Andrea Ahles","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic.","Dawn Gilbertson","Good morning. Gary, I wonder if you could revisit for a minute in the website now down back in early June, what you've learned from it. What the real cause was in the past? Give us a sense of \u2013 can you quantify any financial impact from being down for a couple of days?","Gary Kelly","Well. Dawn, good to hear from you. Yeah, I think the headline there, it was just an extraordinarily successful sale. But, Bob, by the way did a tremendous job of managing through that challenge. So Bob, any thought do you want to share there to Dawn's question?","Robert Jordan","Well, Dawn, I think it shows you the power of a low fare. So we plan for these things as always we test and we were just overwhelmed with the demand the first couple of days. We did uncover some technical things that were fixed rapidly, but you just can't test everything. But really what is the demand coming to the side. At the end of the day, we decided to extend the sale by a day, which is a little abnormal for us and in totality, the sale performed better than we expected despite those two days that were an issue.","So that last day in other word made up \u2013 more than made up for all of the issues in the bookings that we couldn't take those first couple of days. So at the end of the day despite the challenges, we know because our customers a lot of issues not being able to get into the website and we've really apologized for that. But at the end of the day, financially the sale was really good despite those issues.","Dawn Gilbertson","Perfect.","Robert Jordan","Welcome.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda Rutherford","Thanks, Tom and thank you all for being with us today. If the media has any follow-up questions, please let us know. You can call 214-792-4847 or of course send an inquiry to swamedia.com. Thanks so much.","Operator","And this does conclude today's call.

My name is Tom and I'll be moderating today's call. Today's conference is being recorded and a replay will be available on Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call to discuss our first quarter 2016 results. Joining the call today we have Gary Kelly, Chairman, President, and CEO; Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","Please note today's call will include forward-looking statements. And because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations, and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance, and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially. As this call will include references to non-GAAP results excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release in the Investor Relations section at Southwest.com for further information, regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","At this time, I'd like to go ahead and turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Marcy, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. We are absolutely delighted with these results and considering the quality of our operation, the hospitality of our customer service and these strong profits, it is absolutely the best start we've had to a year in over two decade. So, I'm very, very pleased.","Of course, a big driver in our 33% earnings per share growth is a lower jet fuel price, but the revenue performance was also superb. This year is essentially the follow-through to a healthy expansion that began back in 2014, with the repeal of the Wright Amendment and then the aggressive expansion out of Dallas Love Field and that was followed by the integration and conversion of AirTran at yearend 2014. And that generated a lot of new flights in Southwest as well.","Following the AirTran conversion, we launched four new international cities in 2015, as well as a new terminal and domestic gateway at Houston Hobby. So, you add all that up and it's a 9.2% capacity growth here in the first quarter. I would certainly admit that that is a lot, and what is impressive is that our revenue growth kept pace. So, we continue to experience outstanding performance out of Dallas Love Field. The rest of our developing markets are providing a very nice tailwind as well, as they continue along an expected maturity path.","Last year at this time, we had about 20% of our system in development, and this year because we have intentionally slowed the additions of new markets, we have only about 5% in development. And of course, as a backdrop, the industry is adding seats aggressively. It's a very competitive environment. Of course, that's all fine with us, we have low cost and we have a great low fare brand, but we've been very pleased with the consistent strong demand for the Southwest product, resulting in yet another record load factor in the first quarter, and numerous other records for that matter. But the point is even in the face of our growth and the intensely-competitive environment, we're doing really, really well.","And I would attribute that to a couple of things. First and foremost to our people, and the terrific service that they offer our customers every single day, I'm very proud of them. And of course, I congratulate them on these great results and the record profit sharing that they have earned. I also attribute our results to our strong domestic network, where we offer more seats and board more customers than any other airline.","Our marketing department in particular has done a terrific job of distilling our message with our advertising campaign on Transfarency. The customer awareness of the low fare value that you get with Southwest is very high. And that timing of that campaign matches perfectly with the incredible momentum that we have had with our Rapid Rewards loyalty program. So, we have a strong profitable network, we have great service, low fares with nothing to hide. We have an award-winning loyalty program and all of that served up by outstanding employees. So, we are exceptionally well positioned to compete and grow and we intend to keep it just that way.","Before I turn it over to Tammy, I have noticed in some of the reports this morning, a little bit of confusion. So, I did want to make an opening clarifying point, which is \u2013 with the now earlier retirement of our Classic fleet, I just want to be sure that everyone understands that what we said in our press release is that means that the growth rate will be less, not that our capacity will be less. So, we will still grow available seat miles under any scenario that we've contemplated in 2017 compared to 2016, and then the same would be true also for 2018 as compared to 2017. The point is, is that the growth rate in 2017 will no doubt be less than it could have been.","So, Tammy with those opening remarks, let me just turn it over to you to take us through the quarter, please ma'am?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Gary, and welcome everyone. We're thrilled to report on our exceptionally strong first quarter results. Net income, excluding special items, increased almost 26% year-over-year to a record $567 million and earnings per share grew 33%. This represented our 12th consecutive quarter of record profits.","Our revenue results remained at record levels, and we continued to benefit from low fuel prices and our ongoing fleet modernization efforts. We expanded our operating margins, excluding special items to 19.7%, which is the highest it's been in more than 35 years. And our pre-tax return on invested capital excluding special items for the 12 months ended March 2016 was 33.4%, which well exceeded our cost to capital on after-tax basis. Just a fantastic start to the year, and I'd also like to congratulate our wonderful employees on these outstanding results and the record first quarter profit sharing of $155 million.","Our strong revenue performance in first quarter was a significant driver of our record first quarter earnings. Operating revenues grew to a record $4.8 billion, and our passenger revenues also grew to record levels. Strong demand for our low, friendly fares and the overall strength of our network were contributing factors to our 9.3% increase in revenues. We're pleased with the performance of our development markets that resulted in about a point in that tailwind to RASM in first quarter. International markets also performed in line with our expectations, including our new Houston market and Dallas continues to produce solid results with load factor expansion and strong margins in first quarter.","Our Rapid Rewards revenue production was very strong in the quarter, including approximately $125 million year-over-year incremental revenues from our amended co-brand agreement with Chase last July. And our ancillary revenues continue to perform very well. Our revenue growth was in line with our capacity, resulting in flat RASM, which was industry-leading and notable considering the one-point to two-point impact from our stage and gauge increase in first quarter. All around, very pleased with the first quarter revenue performance.","While the weak yield environment has continued into second quarter, demand so far has remained solid. And based on our current bookings and revenue trends, we are expecting a modest growth in second quarter 2016 RASM performance year-over-year. And just as a reminder again, this outlook includes roughly a $125 million from the Chase agreement and accounting change. But just as a reminder, that we will lapse that year-over-year benefit in the third quarter.","Our freight revenue was down slightly year-over-year and other revenue production was boosted by the Chase agreement, but also by a 12% increase in ancillary revenues mostly from growth in EarlyBird and our upgraded boarding product. We currently expect second quarter 2016 freight and other revenues to increase from second quarter last year.","Turning to our costs, we are very pleased with our first quarter cost performance. Our operating unit costs excluding special items decreased 2.6% year-over-year from ongoing fleet modernization benefits, milder weather and lower jet fuel prices. Our economic fuel price per gallon declined 11% year-over-year to $1.78. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower crude and heating oil prices, offset by higher hedging settlements year-over-year. We ended up a little higher than our previous guide at the beginning of March, simply due to the increase in the crude and heating oil since that time.","And based on market prices as of Monday and our second quarter hedge that remains unchanged, we currently expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $1.75 to $1.80 range. And for full year 2016, we currently expect to fall in the $1.85 to $1.90 range based on current market prices.","Excluding fuel and special items, our unit costs were comparable to first quarter last year and down slightly when you also include \u2013 excuse me, exclude profit sharing. This was better than our previous guidance due to milder weather and the associated cost avoidance as well as shift in project spend to later this year.","Based on our current cost trends, we expect second quarter 2016 CASM, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing, to increase approximately 2% year-over-year, and roughly one point of the year-over-year increase is driven by accelerated depreciation from our Classic retirements. And the remainder of the cost inflation is largely the result of timing of advertising and technology investments.","For the full-year 2016, we continue to estimate a modest 1% increase in our unit cost, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing, which again is driven entirely by the accelerated depreciation.","Our balance sheet and cash flows remain very strong. And our cash and short-term investments were $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We allowed our cash to build a bit as we plan to fund our 2015 profit sharing accrual later this month. And we also intend to launch a $200 million accelerated share repurchase, which will be completed next month. Our record free cash flow was $1.2 billion as a result of strong operating cash flow of $1.6 billion and $438 million of capital spend. For our full-year 2016, we continue to estimate manageable CapEx of approximately $2 billion.","We returned $596 million to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter. And as I previously mentioned, we will be launching a $200 million accelerated share repurchase this month to complete our current $1.5 billion repurchase authorization. And this was on the heels of returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2015. Returning significant value to our shareholders remains a priority, along with preserving the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows. Our leverage including balance sheet (sic) [including off balance sheet] aircraft leases remains in the low-to-mid 30% range, and we are very proud of our strong balance sheet, and we remain the only domestic airline with an investment grade rating from all three rating agencies.","Before I wrap up, I'd like to spend just a little bit of time going over our announcement this morning regarding our Classic retirement fleet plans. So as you will recall in January, we announced our intent to retire our Classic fleet no later than mid-2018. Earlier this month, we made the decision to refine the acceleration date to no later than third quarter 2017 to allow for our Classic fleet to be retired ahead of our planned operating date of the Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft. By doing so, we'll alleviate the potential training complexities related to operating both the Classic and MAX aircraft.","Boeing and the FAA aren't expected to determine their training requirements of operating the Classic, MAX pair until May of 2017 at the earliest, which doesn't allow adequate time to be trained and operationally ready for a 2017 MAX launch. So our preference to address the undefined FAA requirement was to segment Classic and MAX flying. We've been working with the SWAPA negotiating team to come up with a mutually beneficial solution to address the segmentation, but unfortunately, we've been unable to come to an agreement. So in order to move forward with our plan to launch the MAX, we must proceed with a solution, which retiring our Classic fleet no later than third quarter 2017 provides.","So as a result of this decision, we'll have about 50 fewer aircraft than previously planned in fourth quarter 2017, which obviously also creates less capacity. And again, as Gary mentioned, we intend to have capacity growth but just this decision alone creates less capacity than what we had previously planned. That said, we're evaluating our options given these circumstances and believe we have a lot of flexibility to manage through the temporary dip in our fleet as we did with the 717s including utilization of our fleet.","So with that in mind, we continue to expect our year-over-year fleet growth for the three years ended 2018 to average no more than 2%, and again our annual year-over-year capacity over that period is still expected to peak this year at 5% to 6%. So while we continue to evaluate our fleet plans based on where we are today, our aircraft CapEx forecast remains in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range for this year. And while I mentioned before our preference for a number of reasons would have been to segment our fleet, however we still estimate EBIT improvement of at least $200 million from accelerating the Classics from the 2021 timeframe to 2017, again largely driven by maintenance and fuel savings.","This is net of the impact of the estimated accelerated depreciation of approximately $130 million that will largely be expensed during 2016. And of course, accelerating our Classic retirements results in an improved customer service even faster with a fully equipped Wi-Fi fleet by the end of third quarter of next year.","So, with regards to capacity, just again to be clear, we continue to plan for 5% to 6% year-over-year growth this year. Our second quarter and third quarter ASMs will increase in the 4% to 5% range, and we will be publishing our fourth quarter schedule in May, which will go through January 4 of next year. And as we've noted previously, the majority of 2016's capacity growth is related to the annualized impact of 2015's unique expansion opportunity. So while our capacity plans beyond 2016 are yet to be determined, we do expect 2017 and 2018 year-over-year ASM growth to bend down from 2016's level. We will remain disciplined in our approach to growth with a focus of flexibility to adjust if needed and with a goal to preserve strong returns and margins.","So, in conclusion, we had another record quarter with or without the benefit of substantially lower fuel prices. Our earnings and margins improved year-over-year. Demand remained strong, producing record revenues and our outlook for second quarter suggest positive operating unit revenue growth. Our cost outlook for the year is for modest inflation driven largely by our decision to accelerate the retirement of the Classic fleet even faster than we had previously announced, which is expected to produce significant cost savings and EBIT improvement of at least $200 million. Fuel prices remain lower year-over-year, and we have had very strong free cash flow this year, and our balance sheet is strong as ever.","We've continued our commitment to return value to shareholders, and intend to complete our current authorization with the launch of a $200 million ASR by the end of this month, and we will continue to prudently manage our capital spend, and we'll remain disciplined in our valuation of future growth opportunities. Again, our pre-tax return on invested capital was an exceptional 33.4%. Our outlook for second quarter supports another quarter of strong margins, likely in excess of first quarter's 19.7%.","And with that, I'd like to close by thanking our employees again for another fantastic quarter. So, Tom, we'll be happy to open it up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin with our first question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Can you just talk about the RASM trend from here, obviously you've got a nice increase going into the second quarter. But as we think about just the rest of the year, and well I think the credit card deal, is it going to be hard for you to stay in that positive territory, that's the first question. And then the second is, you talked about kind of evaluating or looking at a range of options to address some of the Classic flying, can you just talk about what those range of options are? Is there the potential for more CapEx or more orders or anything like that? Thank you.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Rajeev. I'd be happy to start with your question regarding RASM trends. So, I'll just walk you through the quarter a bit. So, just at the highest level, January and February RASM were slightly down and then March was slightly up, which got us to the roughly flat unit revenue comparison with about $15 million of benefit from Easter in March. So, April RASM adjusted for Easter is currently running in line with March, and as you think about the comparisons as we move forward in the quarter, we expect those to improve as a result of the increased competitive environment that we began experiencing in May and June of last year.","And then of course as a reminder again, we'll continue to have the year-over-year benefit from the Chase agreement \u2013 at least through the second quarter here. So, again I think we're positioned very well here as we start second quarter, and I would just characterize the demand environment as solid. And so at this point just we're continuing to see the same sort of trends that we saw in the first quarter.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm sorry. What about just the rest of the year and keeping that trend going, especially with the Chase agreement lapsing?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think that's the one. Yeah, so it's always hard to predict further out in the year. Certainly, we're off to a good start here in the second quarter. And as you pointed out, the comparisons do become more difficult in the second half, because we lapsed the benefit of the Chase agreement.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I might take up the \u2013 unless you have any more questions on that Rajeev, I might take up the fleet question for a second. I think it is the usual suspects, they're available to us. We can tweak the utilization of the aircraft, which translates to a longer duty day of the airplane, I'm not sure that that's what we want to do, but that is an option. In other words, just flying later earlier and later in the day. We can search the used market for more 700s and we can \u2013 we'll have some options as you know by our fleet chart, we have options that can be exercised as well, which would translate to more \u2013 to be clear that would be more capital spending, that's not in Tammy's capital spending guidance that in other words, the capital spending guidance does not assume the exercise of any options to be clear.","In no scenario that we've talked about would we bring in 50 more airplanes, and Mike (25:13), I don't recall exactly how many aircraft would be ultimately retired under the previous scenario, but I'm going to guess, it was around 30 that would've been retired in one step a 30-ish. So, the 50 is not quite as large as it might sound, although again that's a real number, but we were already going to retire a fair number of aircraft in 2018. So, as I said in the press release, this is all manageable, it's not preferable, but it's all manageable. And we're just not \u2013 the first thing that we wanted to share with all of our team and of course you all as well is that, that is going to happen that being the Classic retirement acceleration.","Now, the company can go to work on translating that into maintenance programs for that fleet to now retire earlier, that will avoid some maintenance spending, as Tammy's already made clear. And then, we can explore other options as far as bringing either leased equipment in or exercising some options and spending a little bit more capital. But I think the other thing just to make sure that everybody is clear in their head on is that, our projected fleet at the end of 2018 is unaffected by any of this. So, you're simply talking about accelerating retirements from 2018 into 2017. And that makes this all for us a little bit easier and another reason, why we'll want to be thoughtful about bringing on more airplanes to replace that. So all of that is still an open question and as soon as we make some choices there, I am sure we'll be sharing those.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Tammy.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Gary, on the topic of the Classics, is the decision potentially reversible, and how much lead time would you need if you did negotiate a solution to keep these airplanes in the fourth quarter of 2017? I'm trying to assess at lower capacity is it done deal here or if this is merely a shot across SWAPA's bough that could be revisited at the negotiating table?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I read your note earlier, so I'm glad you asked me the question because one thing I wanted to clarify is this is not a shot, contrary to the way our industry has worked with employees in the past, that's not the way we do business here at Southwest, so.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, duly noted.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know that, I just wanted to be sure that all of our listeners know that, but that's not what this is about. We're here to take care of our people and clearly accelerating this retirement is not going to be a good thing for our employees, this is not a bad thing, but we are not at war with our people, we're at war with our competitors, number one. With respect to whether it is negotiable, well, in that spirit, of course, we want to continue to work with the pilot union in particular to do what we can to keep our cost competitive and grow this airline, so that we can be as competitive as possible.","I don't realistically see a scenario, Mike (28:57), where we can \u2013 I mean that's why we're sharing this today, it's not so much that it is a decision, I don't see that we have any choice because we have to begin to put plans into effect for training, maintenance and then if we are going to go out and try to mitigate the earlier retirement, we've got to get working on that and I'm sure that sooner than later, we want to make commitments there. So, as a practical matter, I think that's a done deal. And to be blunt, I just don't see SWAPA moving on their position regarding segmentation. So, as a practical matter, I think it's a done deal.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. On the topic of SWAPA and the pilot offer from last month, it did look pretty rich to us and represented over two points of CASM by our analysis and again that's just the pilots, all in it's getting hard to imagine how the entirety of your new contracts won't increase ex-fuel CASM by four points, possibly more if it was rolled up into a single year. What assurances, Gary, can you give us that you possess sufficient revenue initiatives that can offset this cost pressure or do we just have to assume that post-labor, Southwest will have lower, still very good, but lower margins than today on a fuel neutral basis?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, great questions. Obviously, it is very important for us to maintain our low fare brand and our low fare brand is not negotiable. In order to have a business in a low fare brand, we have to have that supported by low cost. So, that's what the company was founded on 45 years ago and we're certainly not going to re-trade that.","All these negotiations, they are complex, they take a long time and especially in light of the fact that we are in mediation where the mediator has asked us to maintain confidentiality about what is discussed, I know you don't expect me to go into any detail, but I certainly want to honor that request for confidentiality. But all of this just has to be addressed at the negotiating table, and with an eye towards rewarding our people, and compensating them handsomely, but doing that in a way where we maintain industry leading productivity and efficiency so that we sustain our low cost structure. So, what I can give you assurance on is that we have not wavered on our desire to achieve that goal, and we'll have to continue to work together with our union leadership to be able to live up to that.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Gary, I appreciate the color, and thanks for even finding the time to read our short blurb this morning. I'm flattered. So thanks again.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jamie, we're fascinated by it. So, I would never miss it.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Take care everybody.","Operator","And we'll go next to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. So, Gary or maybe Bob if he's there too, when you think about the heavy mix of connecting traffic at Love Field, even more specifically on the Wright Amendment routes being so high like well above 40% I think, it looks like you may have sort of inadvertently created a bit of a rolling hub there. So, thinking about that in the context of the new market development, how satisfied are you right now with your ability to manage yields in Dallas on an O&D basis given all those connections, and is that an opportunity that is sort of a new for you guys that maybe has a little bit of underappreciated upside that even you yourselves are unable to quantify right now?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm going to let Bob speak to that as well, and he is here, he's sitting right by me.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No actually I feel like the Dallas Love Field operation is pretty much in line with what I would have expected except as I admitted to you all before, the rapid development of those markets and the full flights actually took me a little bit by surprise. I thought it would take us a while longer to produce the kind of results we have there. Tammy, I did glance this morning earlier, the returns out of Dallas are still right at system average, maybe just a hair below for the first quarter. So, simply meaning Hunter that it is, I would not call Dallas in development, clearly Bob is going to disagree and say there's certain markets that he wants to see better performance but overall as an entity, it looks really good.","I've never noticed any remarkable difference in the O&D mix versus connects at Dallas versus any other place. Sounds like you've been studying this, but our intent would be to have Chicago, St. Louis, Phoenix, Baltimore, all of those very large operate \u2013 Houston, all of those very large operations look roughly the same. And I have not seen anything that says that it is remarkably different, and I certainly haven't seen anything so far to suggest that there is any disappointment whatsoever in Dallas.","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. No. Hunter, this is Bob. And thanks for the question. I think a couple of things, our Dallas performance is right in line with system as Gary said. Now, we built Dallas up in a series sort of tranches of adding flights and so some groupings of flights are more mature than others. So, I'll tell you that the last couple of groupings that we added which are obviously younger are continuing to develop and we'll see that I'm confident over time, so there's still room for improvement in Dallas, even though it is right at system average.","On the traffic mix, just because Dallas is constrained, always remember, we would love to have more flights in Dallas than we can have. And so, because of that, we're always going to bias for local traffic more than we would in an unconstrained large city like a Chicago for example. So we do, because we could have more capacity in Dallas. Dallas will always I think slightly underweight the flow and connect traffic compared to what it could be if we were not constrained, because we've got to make room for local traffic which again there is more local traffic demand than we have room for at the gates and flights that we have in Dallas.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hunter, the only thing, I would add to what we both said is that we're conscious of this. There are some analogies to Love Field around the country that I won't mention, but we do have techniques where we can influence one way or the other. So we're very happy with the way Dallas is performing. Again it's a constrained market as we know. So we'll have to continue to keep an eye on it. But I don't know if we're hitting the point on your question or not?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. No it's \u2013 we can maybe take this offline, but that's \u2013 I want to ask another question. So that's good enough for now. Thank you for the time. And then if I back out the $125 million credit card benefit, it looks like unless some stuff moved around in the P&L which I'm not aware of, it look likes your other revenue grew by 35%. So first, is that right? And if so, what is that, you only mentioned EarlyBird up, whatever, 12%, and once we lap the credit card, how should we think about that other revenue growth rate in the third quarter and beyond, because again well, I'm just kind of curious of my, first of all, correct my underlying math, and how should we think about it beyond, once we lap the credit card? Thank you.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Hunter, I'll be happy to help with that. Yeah, we are seeing strong growth in our other \u2013 just as a remainder of our \u2013 just so you know where the components of the benefit from our credit card fall, if you will \u2013 about \u2013 the net is the $124 million, and other revenues were increased by about, call it, $175 million, and passenger revenues were decreased by about $50 million. So, I'm not sure if you did your math exactly right there, but that's the split of the net roughly $125 million benefit from Chase. But we're continuing to see strong ancillary revenues. We had strong EarlyBird revenues but again aside...","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we had more bag fees, we had more Wi-Fi, we had more pets...","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's a collection that your \u2013 I can't attest to your math either, but I am certain that we had a very strong growth in the \"group\" of ancillary revenue.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so, just...","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I would think \u2013 I think your question was should that continue, Tammy, I would think that we would continue to see that.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think so, again, just with the caveat of course that we'll lapse the benefit of the chase benefit in July.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for the time and the questions. I guess, Gary, you spoke about this in your prepared remarks, but one of the reasons you have been posting industry-leading revenues of late has been the maturation of many of your routes. As you look at the impact over the course of the year, do you think this maturation is having a bigger impact on revenues today or call it the first half of the year, or do you think this accelerates into the back half of the year? I guess, any color you can provide around the timing of that would be helpful.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Feels like it will trend away from us. So in other words, it's higher today than it should be a year from now. I also think that there is quite a bit of art work that we're debating internally about how to define a development market. So, we're seeing really broad strength in our cities. And, Bob, I don't think we call an additional frequency in a market that's existing, we don't call that \"development\".","Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","No.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I think the impact is likely larger than the point that Tammy shared with you. I think all of our folks agree with that. So we may be a little bit conservative and that may be a conservative outlook as a consequence of that. But the other thing is \u2013 not only is the existing maturing, but we're also slowing down the pace of stuffing in new, and that's all intentional. So we'll have a pretty conservative year here in 2016 in terms of incremental flying that's being added between now and the end of the year, and that will help as well. So the tailwind should exist all year long. I think it will begin to diminish roughly a year from now.","Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And I also just wanted to kind of touch upon the balance sheet and capital returns. I guess, with no change right now in terms of your CapEx spend, do you think we could see a pick-up in the pace of buybacks, particularly as I guess fuel stays a little bit lower for longer now. I guess maybe any color you could provide in terms of how you think about buybacks, returns to shareholders versus new growth at the company? Thanks.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. We are just continuing to balance all the above. We, as I mentioned, we'll be completing our current share reauthorization here next month. So we'll be taking up that question with the board here very soon. But as you can tell from our outlook, we're expecting our cash flows to continue to be very healthy this year, and as we've mentioned a number of times, we expect our capital expenditures to be very manageable, and we're continuing to be very committed to return value back to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, but you'll just have to stay tuned in terms of what we might do beyond this most recent $200 million accelerated share repurchase.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. The only thing that I would add to that very thorough answer is that obviously free cash flow is a very significant guardrail in the way we think about all this. And if you believe that our free cash flow is going to continue to grow, well then that just gives us more latitude to think about it. Likewise, if you're concerned that free cash flow may go the other way, well then that would influence us also. But it is very prominent in our thinking and the next step obviously is to wrap up the existing authorization, and then we'll revisit this question with the board.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. And just the only other comment I would add just to kind of round out the discussion is just on our leverage. We've been managing to kind of low-to-mid 30% range, and we don't really have any plans to change that at least at this juncture.","Andrew George Didora - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, there.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Julie.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Gary, a question on growth. So there is still a lot of growth opportunity for you guys, including resurgence of short haul, international expansion out of Fort Lauderdale and Houston and eventually Hawaii. Does the changed fleet plan impact how you think about prioritizing that growth over the next two years?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I have to smile at Julie, because Bob Jordan is shaking his head, as you're talking about all these opportunities. He is lathering up here. I have to cool him off. I think we have a tactical challenge to work through a step down in the fleet in the late third quarter next year, I think, is the primary challenge. So by the end of the next year, by the end of 2018, we'll be back to our fleet plan. And we haven't given you a precise number there yet, so that's a little P plan. It's not etched in stone. But we'll work through all of that.","In the meantime, it may affect a priority or two. It's a little premature to say. That's one of the reasons that we need to give our team this guidance now is because Bob Jordan and his commercial team are working right now on what the schedule will be in the fourth quarter of 2017, and they've got to know how many airplanes we're going to give them to schedule. So those are questions that we'll be immediately thrashing through.","One thing that's a priority for next year that we won't waiver on is Fort Lauderdale completing the construction of the new international five-gate terminal and then following through the launch international flights there. So that will be a very high and hard priority for 2017 that we'll have to potentially work around as one example. But as I've said several times, I think that this is manageable and we can handle it, and we'll obviously get to work on it here. But, Bob, I don't see any change in priority because of that. (46:16), Bob...","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Is there a timing \u2013 go ahead, Bob.","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President","I agree with Gary. It's tactical. You've got a period of time where you have to manage our wants and our needs. A lot of what you mentioned, we're going to always pace our growth here. And so some of the things you mentioned are already in our sights 2018 or beyond anyway. So those are really unaffected because once you get into the mid-to-late 2018, we're sort of back to where we expected. So it's really just a short-term challenge, but it will be painful.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, it will...","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President","It will definitely be painful.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll have hard decisions. And the thing that we've liked here in 2016, as a pretty vivid example, the plan that we had for this year did not include any new cities, and we will very likely have four as it turned out for 2016 with three Cuba cities and Long Beach. So it's nice to have that flexibility. Those four markets don't require a lot of aircraft time, but we did have enough in reserve where we could jump on those opportunities. So we may have to forego some things like that if they appear during that time period in 2017, 2018, but again we'll be able to manage and I don't think that this really impacts our strategy long-term.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And, Gary, can you just remind us the timing on the expansion out of Fort Lauderdale, if there is any update on the construction of the new facility?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't believe we have any new updates. It's first half of next year. I think a decent assumption, I think, that we've been sharing publicly is midyear but we don't have a precise date yet.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","And we'll go next to Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I just wanted to ask about Houston. Since the international gates opened there, I've been a little surprised I think there's maybe up to 10 daily flights out of Houston internationally. Just wondering how may gates are you using there and what the plan is and maybe what similarities we might have as we think about the growth out of Fort Lauderdale International?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, and Mike can help me here or Bob for that matter. Let me give it a try and see if I'm answering your question. If not, please redirect this. But our rough estimate with five gates, assuming that we have access to five, we have four under lease and as long as the fifth is open and available to us, we can use five. So the capacity for five gates international flying is roughly 25 departures. And I think today we're maybe 11 international departures, 12 international departures out of Hobby. And I'm pretty sure that our folks at the airport will also use those gates as they need to for domestic flights.","So I think if I'm understanding your question, we're where we expected to be by the way at Houston Hobby, not a year later. We're just months into operation there. We did not expect to be at capacity that fast. And I know Bob will continue to have Houston as a priority to continue to add international flights there in the future. I can't give you prediction and would not want to give you prediction yet as to when we might be at capacity in the terminal, but we've got plenty of capacity now. It's a great facility. Our customers absolutely love it, and we'll continue to have flights in Houston. Is that responsive to your question?","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks, Gary.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And then Fort Lauderdale, I think again it's a little bit premature to tell you exactly what our plans are, but they're not similar from what I've described at least in concept. It's another five-gate facility. Bob, off the top of my head, I don't recall exactly how many gates we have access to. I believe it's all five.","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's all five, yes.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's the same scenario as we have in Houston. So I'm going to guess that we have roughly the same 25 departure a day capacity there. And now Cuba, assuming that all gets approved, our request is to add flights out of Fort Lauderdale. So if we start Cuba flying this year, we'll already have some international flights even before the terminal opens, which was in our original plan. So Fort Lauderdale could ramp up faster than Houston has, I just don't know yet. It's a little bit premature to say.","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Savi, the only other thing to add is the, because we have a lot of local traffic out of Houston, which is fantastic, we have probably even more flow and connect than we expected, which is also fantastic. So we're really happy. It's right on what we expected. Fort Lauderdale and Houston there will be some synergy. When Fort Lauderdale opens, because you will have flight schedules that work together, because it's also a gateway. So you will have customers that connect over Fort Lauderdale that could potentially have a return flight that connects over Houston. So they will actually complement each other in terms of the schedule for folks who are connecting in those airports. So that's a great thing as well. So the Fort Lauderdale will help Houston and Houston will help Fort Lauderdale.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And if I may just follow-up on the unit revenue front, Tammy, I know you provided color. So if I'm thinking about 2Q correctly, you do have a nice \u2013 a slowdown in capacity I'm guessing, should help unit revenue and you have easier comparisons and possibly the only headwind being the Easter shift. Am I thinking about that correctly?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I wouldn't dispute any of that, Savi. I think you're thinking about that exactly, right.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks very much. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time. As I look at your cash flow statement, Tammy, you've got air traffic liability declining on a year-on-year basis from $717 million last March to $685 million this March, and you've got 5.5% more capacity growth. Should I be worried about that decline?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, not at all, Helane. So there's no concerns. Just based on our outlook and just our cost outlook and feel we're expecting healthy cash flows, and no concerns on the air traffic liability. Of course, you've got to take into considerations the Rapid Rewards impact of that. But when you adjust for that, there is nothing unusual going on there.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you. And then my other question is with respect to \u2013 I'm sorry, I haven't paid attention to this. Is there anything new at Love Field with respect to Delta and their access to your gates, your one gate?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, there is nothing new there. Where it stands is the judge ruled and Southwest is in the process of appealing that ruling. So there is really no new news and nothing further to discuss on that. But I was just kind of curious by your cash flow question on air traffic liability. I'll bet you that it's just a timing of Easter. Where all...","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","That could be.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...burned off earlier, but you asked a good question...","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But everything looks really good. But...","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, there is...","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...I am analytically kind of curious about your question.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And one other just point on our air traffic liability. We've also seen that grow just simply because we're publishing our schedule out a little further. So there's a few things that are impacting that on a year-over-year basis.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Are you seeing any trends in air fares that you could comment on; improving, staying the same, declining, maybe that's an effective air traffic liability?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think so. Well, it's a very competitive environment and I'm very pleased with our results, especially in light of that. The comps are a little distorted because of the credit card deal and accounting change, but I will say, I think, Tammy, that consistent with what we're reporting on today, which are booking trends and revenue trends for April, there is nothing new to report there. So the trends are continuing; not better, not worse.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. That's all fair. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","And we have time for one more question today. We'll take our final question from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just on the Classics, how practically do you expect to do this. Do you want to fly them as long as you can before the MAX shows up and have one big wave of retirements or should we be thinking about a step down as you get closer?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no. We have to have every pilot trained to sit in every cockpit. And so it's all or nothing is the way that this has been presented to us. Now we don't know exactly what training requirements Boeing and the FAA and Southwest would ultimately work out, but we can't wait that long to develop a training program and then get all of our pilots through it. So, no, there will be a day and one day we'll be flying 50 Classics and the next day we'll be flying zero.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. It will be a hard stop.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It will be a hard stop and so in reference to Julie's earlier question, that's really the task at hand is to figure out how to smoothly do that.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I'm confident we can. It will be painful, but we'll try to at least seasonally it steps down post Labor Day. So we have less flying in September than we do early August anyway. So we'll manage it and there will be a little bit of pain, but hopefully, we'll be able to contain that and get over it and then about a year later, it'll all be behind us.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President","David, I think a way to think about it is, when we put the last AirTran aircraft down at the end of 2014, we put them down in a lump and we began a new schedule the next day and that is exactly the way we're going to manage this.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think Bob makes it \u2013 I'm so glad you mentioned that, because the point is, we have had practice at this and know how to do it. And I don't think the world knew a thing. We knew it internally. But we got through it and everything worked out just fine. So, I think, like I said, I think we can manage it and I'm not overly concerned about it.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","To Bob's point and Gary's point, if I remember correctly that was about 27 airplanes. So, again, we believe this is all very manageable.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Shifting gears a little bit, Long Beach, I know it's a small new city opened, but can you talk a little bit? Obviously well established in California. How does the launch fit in? Is that somewhere you'd like to turn into more full-size Southwest city or what happens there?","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think we're ecstatic to get a foothold into Long Beach here. So we had no avenue for a long time. And so just to be able to have a modest schedule to Oakland is great. The airport interacts really well with our other LA area service. So we don't feel like there will be a cannibalism or anything like that. So I think this will really be new traffic for us.","Obviously there are constraints. We'd love to have more flights over time. I don't see a case where we would add dozens and dozens of additional flights, but if we could get another two, another four over time, I think that would be wonderful because I think the traffic is there. Our bookings look good. We're really happy with the traffic build so far and we're looking forward to starting service.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And you probably know this, David, but we're the number one airline in the five-county area...","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...among the four airports. So I think this will be really awesome. We'll be able to provide more flexibility to customers to go out of one airport and back to another. And if we can get more slots, we would love to do that.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And if I can sneak one last one in about geography and RASM performance. I would think California best, Houston worse. Is that right or is just any color around what you're seeing around the country?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're seeing California as strong and we're seeing just general strength across the network and as we've called out before, just we have had a high percentage of our markets under development over the last year. So, some of those markets that have come on more recently, those are ramping up, but no, general strength across the system.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I think you're referring I guess to oil and gas and...","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Houston looks fantastic, Midland looks fantastic.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we're just not (1:00:36) the impact.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, our business is held up quite well, I think it would be fair to say that it's not as strong as it was, but it's still really strong. So I feel real good about that. But I agree with Tammy's first reaction, which is it's mostly a function of where we have developing markets. So I think our strength is very, very broad and very consistent across the U.S. And again, we're really pleased, we're pleased with our network. It's been under construction for years and the results look really good, revenue management has done a phenomenal job in a very competitive environment.","And the marketing, I think is just \u2013 no one has asked us about it, but I think the marketing and the messaging has been absolutely superb, presenting Southwest competitive advantages in a very clear and colorful way. And they're going continue on that course and I think it's going to continue to drive strong revenues for us as well.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just one clarification on a place like Midland, are you talking sort of absolute performance or is that relative to the system right now when you say fantastic?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Absolute, absolute performance, oh, yeah. It's very good, it's not as good as it was, but...","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Okay, that's what, yeah, that's what I was trying to make sure that I was...","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We've been clear about that, but it is still very, very good and the same applies to Houston.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. I appreciate the color.","Operator","And that concludes the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you for joining. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.","Linda Rutherford - Vice President Communication & Outreach","Good day, Tom. We can go ahead and get started, if you want to give instructions on how to queue up for questions.","Operator","Yes, ma'am. We'll take our first question from Susan Carey with The Wall Street Journal.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Hey, everybody. Two little ones. Tammy, you mentioned earlier that this operating margin in the first quarter of 19.7% was the highest in I believe you said 35 years, is that correct?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That is correct.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","And is this, what was your pre-tax margin in the quarter, or is this the pre-tax margin?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That was our operating margin.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","I know, I'm really...","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Our pre-tax...","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","...obsessed lately with pre-tax?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Pre-tax was 18.7%.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","18.7%. And secondly I noticed that you give kind of your guidance in terms of RASM. So you guys don't break out PRASM guidance?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. We don't, but that's simply because of the \u2013 as a distortions that the impact of our Chase co-brand agreement has, because of the reclassifications resulting from just the accounting change of that, it's much more meaningful just to provide it at a RASM level. So you are correct, we're just providing guidance based on RASM.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We did, Susan, provide PRASM guidance until third quarter last year...","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Until third quarter, yeah.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","When it got confusing because of this new credit card deal, and it changed the accounting, and so it rendered the PRASM numbers irrelevant. But maybe one of these days, Tammy will get back to that.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I can certainly \u2013 I'd be happy to walk you through that if you're...","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Because you gave us the actual PRASM number of minus 3.6% in the current \u2013 the guidance. I mean, the...","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Release.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","The release.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And Susan, if you backed out the Chase benefit, PRASM would have been down 2.4%.","Susan Carey - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Okay. Okay. It's fair enough. Thank you so much.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're very welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News Inc.","Guys, thanks for the time. I just was wondering if there was any comment on what a stronger Alaska with the pending acquisition of Virgin America means for Southwest, both in the California market, but then also at Love Field and what the potential with the two gates Virgin currently has there is? Thank you.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet, Conor. No, we really don't have a comment on that. And we'll wait to see what the government approval process reveals and if there are assets that are for sale, we'll obviously do our duty and take a look at them, but otherwise I don't have any comment on that.","Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Koenig with The Associated Press.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Hi, Gary.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi David.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","You said just a minute ago that Houston and Midland are performing, I think fantastic was the word you used, right. That seems to be very different from the United's experience right now in Houston. So why are you doing well there and they are not, is it different type of passenger or what can you say to explain that?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we don't really compare ourselves to United, first of all. So, I don't know that I have an explanation. You might ask United that question, but we have had great success in Houston in particular over the past four years as we have been working with the city to reestablish international service at Houston Hobby. That generated a significant amount of grassroots support locally to convince the city to add that service, which we were very pleased with. What we had discovered at the time when we started this in 2012 is that the air fares, especially internationally out of Bush were extraordinarily high, double \u2013 in fact the air fares compared even to Chicago on the same airline to points south.","So, I think what we've been able to do is build a brand new five gate terminal, and the City of Houston and the community are very excited about that. We've been able to add a lot of new flights at lower fares, and the community has been very excited about that. And our low costs are such that we can offer that very profitably.","We have a decades long business built up in Houston, including connecting it to Midland, and we just have a real strong franchise there. We have a lot of loyal customers; we have a lot of Rapid Reward members.","So, anywhere from a third to 40% of our customers fly on us on business. So, I can assure you it's not because we don't have business customers, we probably carry more business customers in the United States than any other airline. But I would just attribute it again to great service by our people, the great network that we offer, they are offering a great product, excellent on time performance. And we've really made a very significant investment in the community, and I think the community is appreciative of that.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","And can you say how much of the what you're seeing there is due to the international flying you're now doing out of Hobby?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the international component in fairness to your question is relatively small. I believe, Bob, we've got about 160 daily departures, so what, 5% of that would be international.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Right.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So it's small but it's new product, it's exciting, it causes people in Houston to take notice, and maybe to try Southwest when they haven't flown on us in a while, so there is a halo effect. If you look back, Bob, over a five-year time period, we've added quite a few new domestic nonstops as well. I want to say we have added Newark and LaGuardia, Boston.","Robert E. Jordan - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Vice President","Boston...","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I'm sure there are more David that I just can't recall, but I guess the point is we are growing in Houston, we have made a very significant commitment, we're adding new product, where our people are doing a great job, and we just have a lot of momentum. So I don't know how that compares to our competitors in the market, but I don't sense that they have momentum.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Okay. Thanks very much.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And you can just talk to them to figure out why that is I guess.","David Koenig - The Associated Press","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters.","Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.","Thank you very much. At what point do you see faster yields for domestic travel becoming positive?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll let Tammy explain that, but we are predicting positive unit revenues in the second quarter. So, we were actually slightly positive, although in fairness I call it flat, but we were actually up 0.1%. So, I'm not answering your question literally, but it's a little more complicated than that, but I would say that the substantive answer to your question is, we are already seeing that. But Tammy, you want to explain?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So, if you're referring to our yields per revenue passenger mile...","Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.","Yes, yes.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would just attribute that to, as we mentioned earlier in the call, we are continuing to see a very competitive environment, and I would characterize that as weak, but we've been offsetting that with a strong demand for our service. And so, that's netting to \u2013 we had a flat unit revenue performance in the first quarter and then as we've guided, we're expecting that to turn positive here in the second quarter based on our current trends.","So, I don't know that I can specifically answer when we're going to see our yields turn positive, but what we really focus on of course is our unit revenues and our outlook for unit revenues is favorable here in the second quarter.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So in other words, the yields are distorted year-over-year due to an accounting change and you can make a lot of sense out of that, I was redirecting you just to look at total revenues per available seat mile I think is a better way to evaluate our performance right now.","Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.","Right.","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And you can see that in our fares, our fares were down year-over-year by about $4 on average and that's even with an increased stage length. So, which supports the weak yield environment, but we've been generating record load factors and again offsetting that by strong demand.","Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.","Great. Thank you. I guess two, three follow-ups. One, has the airports where capacity has exceeded demand changed or is it the same that's it's been for the past several months? And then secondly, I guess could you characterize corporate bookings in particular?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yeah, I would say that the main thing that's happening, I don't know how much of the analyst call you listened to, but the main thing that's been happening over the course of the last 12 months is that we had grown aggressively in 2014 and 2015 and added a lot of new markets. So, let's call those developing markets. Those markets have begun to mature. And I think that addresses your question about capacity exceeding demand.","So, virtually all of our markets now are performing well where we feel pretty good about the capacity that we have relative to the demand and the markets where we're continuing to see \u2013 which are very many, but those markets where we're seeing softness, they're the same corporates. So, they're mostly in that development stage, they're new, we're creating awareness with customers, trying to get people to fly us and that's all very, very expected. There are fewer of those today than there were a year ago.","Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.","And on the corporate booking side, it's strong or I guess how would you characterize it?","Tammy Romo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would characterize that as strong. We're seeing a growth in our corporate sales in the high single-digit percent range. So, I would characterize that our corporate bookings are strong, as well as our business mix, our business mix, we've seen really no change there that represents about a third of our passengers.","Jeffrey Dastin - Thomson Reuters Corp.","Great. Thank you, both.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ghim-Lay Yeo with Flightglobal.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the time. I have a question about just the ongoing difference in opinion with the pilots unions over whether their contract is going to allow for the operation of the 737 MAX, has that been resolved and how has today's (1:15:27) with the Classics changed that? Thanks.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The Boeing 737-8 is covered by our contract and we are working with Boeing to put that aircraft into service next year.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal","Okay. Do you have more clarity on when you plan to take delivery of the first aircraft and when you would be placing in revenue service?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Boeing has told us and I believe they've stated publicly that they're comfortable with their contractual commitment, which with us is the third quarter of next year. There have been rumors that they might actually have the aircraft earlier and obviously we continued to have conversation with Boeing. But our plan, which we reiterated this morning with our Classic announcement is that we'll plan to put it into revenue service after Labor Day next year. So, we're anxious to get our hands on the airplane and put it through its proving runs and get all of our training done in advance of that, but that will be our plans. But as far as we know, so far, everything looks really good, looks like it's going to be a great airplane.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal","Okay. So, just one quick follow-up. In the event that the FAA training requirements for the MAX are not finalized say about May, does that impact your entry into service for the aircraft?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, let me be clear on that and Mike, I'll let you comment here too. The May information, the May date that we shared with you was relative to training for both the MAX and the Classic aircraft. Since we are now not going to be flying the Classic that vastly simplifies the training and we do know the training that's required for the MAX or the 737-8 I should say, and that training is very small and that is in development, but that will be done and ready well in advance of May of next year.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal","Okay.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, do you have a date when you're going to start that training?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No, not yet.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But it will be \u2013 the differences between the 737-8 and the 737-800 are very modest and we're very comfortable with that. We'll be ready and approved by the FAA and approved by Boeing.","Ghim-Lay Yeo - Flightglobal","Okay. Thank you so much.","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief\/Correspondent-Bloomberg News","Thank you. Gary, excuse me, the Wall Street Journal has had a story that Boeing is considering yet another version of the 737, and that it would be dubbed as 737 MAX 7X and would fly quite a bit distance further. Have you guys been in talks at all with Boeing about that and do you have any idea at all whether that might be something that you would convert some of your pending orders to?","Gary C. Kelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mary, I'm going to let our good friend Mike Van de Ven answer that question.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Mary, there has been no decisions from Boeing about \u2013 we have firm orders, as you know for 30 of the 737-7 versions of that and there have been no decisions or agreements or thoughts on Boeing on adjusting those firm orders at this point in time.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief\/Correspondent-Bloomberg News","Okay. Are you familiar with this new version that they are talking about?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I've heard rumors, but that there are...","Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief\/Correspondent-Bloomberg News","Okay.","Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","But we're not in a position to comment about any of it.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief\/Correspondent-Bloomberg News","Okay. Is it something that you would look at, I mean, I realize you said, you haven't made a decision of any kind, but is this something that you would look at and consider?","Michael G. Van de Ven - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, absolutely. We would want to go consider different options out there.","Mary Schlangenstein - Bureau Chief\/Correspondent-Bloomberg News","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Rutherford for any additional or closing remarks.","Linda Rutherford - Vice President Communication & Outreach","Thanks a lot Tom.

My name is Tom, and I'll be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com, in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Marcy Brand, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Marcy Brand","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call to discuss our third quarter results. Joining me on the call today is Gary Kelly, our Chairman, President and CEO; Tammy Romo, Senior Vice President, Finance and CFO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and President of AirTran Airways; Mike Van de Ven, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.","Today's call will begin with opening comments from Gary, followed by Tammy providing a review of our third quarter results and current outlook. We will move to the Q&A portion of the call following Tammy's remarks.","Please be advised that today's call will include forward-looking statements. Because these statements are based on the company's current intent, expectations and projections, they are not guarantees of future performance and a variety of factors could cause actual results to differ materially.","As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, excluding special items, please reference this morning's press release and the Investor Relations section of southwest.com for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.","And now I'll turn the call over to Gary for opening remarks.","Gary C. Kelly","Thank you, Marcy, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning for our third quarter financial results. I'll just give a quick overview and then turn it over to Tammy Romo to cover the financial results.","A very strong performance, especially from a revenue perspective, and it was reflecting a robust travel demand environment, but also significant achievements by our people in optimizing the route networks and integrating AirTran. Costs also moderated during the period, and it was a reflection of lower fuel prices versus a year ago and also reduced fuel consumption per unit versus a year ago.","You'll note the increase in productivity with respect to our people versus a year ago, and that is despite the increase in capacity. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our Southwest and AirTran employees for a great quarter. They are working exceptionally hard. The results show it and I really appreciate it.","We've made great progress during the quarter on our strategic initiatives, in particular the AirTran integration, the fleet modernization and the international reservation system technology project. We broke ground on the Houston Hobby international terminal project, which is slated for 2015, and we started the countdown to the 2014 repeal of the Wright Amendment here at Dallas Love Field. There's a billboard outside Dallas Love Field that says, \"51 weeks to nonstop love.\"","Despite these solid results, we have a lot of work to do and also, I would add, a lot of upside. We still have about 15% of our capacity deployed as the AirTran brand, and it is not optimized. Because of the fleet conversions underway, we're under-scheduling our aircraft revenue service. That's compared to where we will be post-integration. And even though we're on track for our planned 2013 AirTran synergies, we have a higher percentage of our system in development. And all of these create earnings drags, which should dissipate post-integration.","Considering all of that, it was an exceptionally satisfying quarter. Our fourth quarter outlook is encouraging as well, in particular the holiday bookings. And as you would expect, we, like everybody else, saw an impact from the government shutdown, but hopefully, that drag will be short lived.","And then finally, our fourth quarter outlook for fuel prices is stable, at least for right now. We're finalizing our plans for 2014. They will most certainly have a bottom line that achieves our 15% return on invested capital mandate. We have no capacity growth planned for next year. In addition to running the business, our goals are to bring up the international service at Southwest and finish the AirTran integration. We'll be very focused on doing everything we can to make our 2014 plans a reality with the normal caveats, of course, for the economy and fuel prices.","So, Tammy, with that very quick overview, let me turn the call over to you.","Tammy Romo","Thank you, Gary. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We reported great results this morning, setting several records.","Our net income, excluding special items, was a record $241 million, which was nearly 150% increase year-over-year, and EPS was a record $0.34, which was in line with consensus and represents 162% year-over-year increase. Our operating income was also a third quarter record at $439 million, which produced an operating margin of 9.7%. Our pretax ROIC for the 12 months ended September 30 was 11%. So, we're making great progress there.","Our revenues for the quarter were also a third quarter record, increasing significantly year-over-year to $4.5 billion. On a unit basis, total operating revenues increased in the 4% to 5% range compared to third quarter last year on a 1% increase in ASM. Our passenger unit revenues increased a little over 5% compared to third quarter last year, with strong unit revenue improvement each month of the quarter. July and August were up about 4% to 5% and September was up 7% to 8% year-over-year, which is much improved from our first-half performance.","July benefited from solid holiday traffic, and healthy demand drove strong yields throughout the quarter. Our business traffic also showed signs of strength. Our outstanding unit revenue performance was particularly notable considering the 4% increase in seats per trip and nearly 2% increase in stage length, which resulted in a drag on PRASM of about 2 points. But please keep in mind, the impact to unit revenue is more than offset by the significant unit cost benefit that is driving the EBIT improvement from our fleet modernization efforts. The large number of developing markets that Gary mentioned was also a drag on our PRASM results, year-over-year close to probably about 1 point. And again, roughly 15% of our network was deployed in new markets or in conversion markets as part of the AirTran integration and our ongoing network optimization efforts. These markets are progressing nicely and developing faster than traditional new Southwest markets.","Our people are doing a fabulous job delivering our strategic and revenue initiatives, which contributed significantly to our record third quarter revenue performance. We realized approximately $120 million in net synergies during third quarter from the AirTran acquisition, with approximately 2\/3 of that coming from net revenue synergy. In fact, about $45 million came from incremental codeshare revenue.","Our Business Select revenues were approximately $27 million, and we recognized approximately $13 million in incremental revenues from our Rapid Rewards program. Our No Show policy was implemented in September and contributed $5 million in incremental revenues in third quarter, and we are on track with our expected $300 million EBIT improvement this year from our fleet modernization efforts, with close to half of that already realized in the first half of this year. Our Wright Amendment revenues were also strong, producing $85 million in third quarter.","Looking ahead, we expect unit revenue trends to be choppy through the remainder of the quarter. Thus far, in October, we were impacted by the government shutdown. We're currently estimating about a $20 million impact from a reduction in government-related travel, and our best guess at this point is that October PRASM will be up about 1 percentage point.","Holiday bookings for the remainder of the quarter are strong, and we currently are expecting healthy year-over-year unit growth for the November\/December combined period. Keep in mind, the late Thanksgiving holiday will create difficult year-over-year comparisons in November but that would have a corresponding benefit, of course, to December.","Shifting to freight revenues and other revenues, our freight revenues were a strong $41 million, benefiting from an expanded cargo network with the introduction of Southwest cargo on AirTran flights during third quarter. Other revenues decreased 7% year-over-year, largely due to AirTran fees continuing to decline with the transition of the AirTran network over to Southwest. EarlyBird revenues increased close to 20% year-over-year to approximately $50 million. And we recognized $62 million in other fees, including $4 million from the A1 to A15 premium boarding at the gate.","We currently expect fourth quarter 2013 freight and other revenues to decrease from fourth quarter 2012, primarily due to the continued decline in AirTran fees as we continue to replace 717 flights and convert 737s to the Southwest fleet.","Turning to fuel, our third quarter 2013 economic fuel price per gallon was $3.06, which was in line with expectations, and the 3.2% decline from last year was driven primarily by a favorable jet differential and just lower prices and $0.01 in hedging gains.","Fuel and oil expense also benefited from better fuel efficiency from our fleet modernization efforts. Our third quarter fuel burn improved by between 3% to 4%, reducing our third quarter fuel costs by approximately $45 million.","Our third quarter hedging premiums were $22 million, which was what we had expected for the quarter. For fourth quarter, we currently have up to 48% of our estimated fuel consumption hedged, but about only 12% of that protection is at Brent prices and that would kick in at $135. And another 36% is at Gulf Coast jet prices at $3.10 market prices and that was as of October 21. Based on this hedge position and current market prices, we expect our fourth quarter fuel price per gallon to be in the $3.05 to $3.10 range, and that reflects a $0.02 locked-in gain. Of course, over the last day or so, jet fuel has dropped again, and we are fully participating in the market declines with reduced prices as our floors are a modest 11% and are more than 20% below the current market.","Our fourth quarter fuel hedging premiums are estimated to be comparable to third quarter's $22 million. Unit cost, excluding fuels, special items and profit sharing, increased 1% year-over-year, which was right in line with expectations. The modest year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increases in salaries, wages and benefits, airports and revenue-related costs, and those were partially offset by lower maintenance.","We expect another good performance in fourth quarter. Based on current cost trends, we expect our fourth quarter unit cost, excluding fuel, special items and profit-sharing, to be relatively flat with fourth quarter 2012's $8.15. This track is right in line with our 2013 nonfuel CASM plan we communicated to you all last December that assumed a modest 1% year-over-year increase in our nonfuel unit cost, excluding special items and profit-sharing. Our anticipated unit cost performance in the second half of this year clearly reflects the benefit of our fleet modernization and other cost control efforts and we're just very pleased with our performance.","On the non-operating cost side, our net interest expense was comparable year-over-year, a trend we expect to continue in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of continuing to pay down debt.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow now, we had another quarter of strong cash flow generation, ending with $3.3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Through the first 9 months of 2013, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow and returned $572 million to shareholders through -- little over $500 million, and that was $0.5 billion in share repurchases and $71 million in dividends. Since May 2011, we have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","During third quarter, we executed a $150 million accelerated share repurchase program. That reduced our third quarter basic share count by approximately 11.5 million shares. We have $375 million remaining under our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. We've made approximately $267 million of debt and capital lease payments through the first 9 months of 2013, including approximately $50 million during the third quarter, and we have approximately $46 million more scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year. Based on scheduled debt payments, our leverage, including off-balance sheet aircraft leases, is expected to decline to the high 30% range by year end, and there has been no change to our 2013 capital spending forecast which remains in the $1.4 billion range.","Overall, our invested capital balance is down $1.2 billion or 9% since last year, which is meaningful and in line with our 2013 plans.","Just a quick recap of our fleet and capacity plans, which are relatively unchanged. Thus far, we've taken delivery of 12 of the 18 planned -800 firm orders and 2 leased -700 aircraft. On the retirement side, we transitioned our first 717 to Delta in September and work is ongoing to transfer 15 more this year. Combined with our Classic retirement schedule, we continue to manage to a relatively flat fleet. We transitioned 2 more AirTran -700s during the quarter, and 1 more, and bringing our total -700s converted to Southwest livery [ph] to '15. We plan to transition 4 more AirTran -700s this year, which will leave 33 next year once the Southwest international reservation system is in place. Our 2013 ASM capacity will increase about 2% year-over-year. And for 2014, our plans remain to keep capacity in line with this year.","Our published flight schedule out through June 6 reflects our continued focus on optimizing the combined network, including 5 more AirTran markets converted to Southwest following Grand Rapids during the third quarter and 5 new overlap markets. We also recently made the decision to no longer operate AirTran's Baltimore to Bermuda service. And while we haven't ruled out a decision to return the future service to Bermuda on AirTran, currently it doesn't meet our performance targets. Next month's flight schedule begins the evolution of AirTran's Atlanta service into a Southwest point-to-point operation. And overall, as I mentioned previously, we have a high-volume of developing markets as we complete the AirTran of -- integration of AirTran. These markets, while a temporary drag on unit revenues, are expected to ramp up quickly to be a positive contributor.","In closing, our strong third quarter results were very encouraging, with our strategic revenue initiatives largely on track, our cost control efforts are working as planned and we will continue to focus on maintaining our strong competitive position. Our financial position remains strong as ever, allowing us to deliver on our plan to aggressively manage our invested capital and return significant value to our shareholders. Our 15% pretax ROIC goal remains a priority, and we are on pace to significantly close the gap this year.","And with that, I think we're ready to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","This will begin our analyst portion of today's Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess a couple of questions here. When we think about maybe the opportunity at Love Field, and this is to Gary. I think you do about 120 departures, and I think you'll have 16 gates there. And I sort of think about Southwest doing 10 turns a gate or so although I think, Gary, we've joked about in the past, I think there's that 1 gate in L.A where you do like 13 flights a day -- or 13 departures. When we think about the potential size that, that airport could become, is it maybe 10 flights a gate per day or is there the opportunity to hardstand flights out there as well? Any color on that would be great.","Gary C. Kelly","Well, with respect to your last question, all the departures there will be via a jet bridge. So the 16 Gates. I think 16 Gates is plenty. I think we'll have all we need and it's a little bit premature to speculate on what the potential is out of this market. But we're excited about the opportunity. I don't see any reason why you couldn't assume 10, at least right now. The bigger aircraft like 737-800 is probably not a reasonable expectation that you could get 10 800 departures a day per gate. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think we'll have all 800s at Dallas Love Field. But your guesstimate for Dallas Love in the 120 range is about right, and I also agree with you that it's a reasonable assumption that the flight activity will go up, but it's a great airport, it's right on track in terms of the construction. 12 gates are open, 8 more will open next year and it'll be ready and we'll be ready. So we're very excited about the opportunity.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hey, Gary, just one other on that. With schedule changes and typically, I think you go out like 220 days or so, like what schedule change should we look for when we should maybe see some changes to the Love schedule? What would be the potential timing on that?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, we typically publish schedules every 2 months, and roughly your 220 is a decent guess. That could be as little as 6 months, maybe 7 months. So that will give you some idea what to look for early next year.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, good. And then just my second question. When I look at your performance this last quarter, when I sort of think about Southwest and how you've priced in the past, a lot of times it would look like that you were more likely to go out with a fuller airplane at the expense of yield. And yet, it seems like this last quarter there were periods where we would see loads down and healthy yields. And I think it was just a function of a good strong pricing environment. But how much of that may be some of the new tools that you've been implementing? I know you've talked about that on the last call, the new O&D revenue management system, maybe some of your techniques on inventory and allocation among the different fare classes. Is that starting to kick in? Are you getting any sort of pickup on that? Anything incremental?","Gary C. Kelly","Mike, I think that's really more evolutionary as opposed to a market change this year versus last year with respect to revenue management tools. But it is the right conclusion to draw that every year, we are adding to our tool chest there. I think more than anything -- and again, we had an 80.8% load factor for the quarter, which, as you know us historically, that's really high. It was off 1 point from a year ago. This year, we were purposefully using less sale activity, a reflection probably of a couple of things. One is just the conversion of AirTran markets into Southwest Airlines and also a reflection of what we believed was a healthier economy this year. So philosophically, we still want to be the low-fare carrier. We like to be aggressive with fare sales and we'll continue to use that technique. The other thing that is nice this year is that we have less markets that are \"new\" to Southwest and where we don't have to depend as much on price to generate trial on our flights or on an AirTran flight, either way. But it's, yes, just a better economic environment overall, much stronger travel demand in the third quarter than what we were seeing in the second quarter and as compared to a year ago. Finally, what is a reality in 2013 is the networks are connected and they were not a year ago, and the schedule in the third quarter was getting more and more optimized for those connected schedules. So they were completely independent a year ago and not nearly as efficient. And I'm sure we were using price to fill up airplanes as a consequence.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question, just in thinking through the growth in seats per departure out into '14, I mean it's running sort of up for now. Presumably, that starts to come down, but is it still up 2-ish percent for 2014?","Tammy Romo","David, we'll still see -- we'll start seeing that tapering off, as you suggest. And so I don't know if it would be up quite 2%. But you're -- probably in the 1% to 2% range is a reasonable guess at this juncture.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And the reason I ask is if we're looking at your -- just thinking, obviously, there's still a lot of piece moving around. If we're thinking about sort of the absolute x fuel cost growth of kind of tapering down the 3.5% range year-over-year, I mean, is the right way to start thinking about '14 from a cost perspective, I know it's early, sort of continuing that level of absolute cost inflation and then mitigating it with some of that upgauging? Does that kind of get us ballpark how we should be starting to think about '14 in terms of CASM?","Tammy Romo","Yes, I think that is fair. And then as Gary mentioned, we are working through our 2014 plan now, and we'll give you better guidance on that at our next conference call.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Excellent. And then just a quick one. Just on the 800s, as you're bringing more 800s in, presumably you're going to hit the sort of least dilutive markets first and then kind of work down the system. Should we be thinking of sort of a lower marginal revenue generation on the 800 as you get more 800s into the system? Or is that kind of holding up as you get more and more of the new planes?","Tammy Romo","So far, it's been holding up, and I think what we're looking at right now for 800 deliveries next year, at least my expectation would be that it would hold up in 2014.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","If I look at the percentage of revenue passengers versus enplaned passenger, it looks like it's gradually declining. And if you apply, just sort of back-of-the-envelope, an average fare to that mix shift, it looks like the last year's third quarter, for example, I think you're sacrificing about $63 million of revenue, and that's about 150 basis points that would be PRASM growth. We talked on the last call about the incremental cost method versus deferred method of accounting, but you're not really recognizing the revenue and the cash. Given the incremental methods of recognizing this, does it seem like it's still appropriate? And how are you guys -- I know you just made a change to the frequent flier program recently, but how are you guys going to sort of ensure that the liability doesn't run away from you because of the generosity of the program, or at the very least, how you recognize it from an accounting perspective?","Tammy Romo","I think there's 2 -- I mean, the accounting is ultimately tied to the economics of the program. So obviously, we're monitoring all of that. And we recently increased, I guess, the redemption co-efficient, which would -- it's obviously a tool that we have to manage that liability. So we will continue to monitor that. But you're correct, we do account for that on the incremental cost method.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. All right, that's fine. And in terms of sort of, Gary, how you think about the brand and managing customer perception and customer confusion. If you guys are to do things like, say, restrict certain discounted fares, things like that, maybe a little more than just around the edges, is it fair to assume that maybe AirTran has to be retired, whether it's the website being shutdown or the planes being completely painted? The brand of AirTran has to pretty much go away before we think about you guys maybe tinkering with maybe a little more substantive revenue initiatives?","Gary C. Kelly","I don't think so. In other words, to me what we want to do is manage the amount of change that's underway at any given point in time, more than being concerned about the brand confusion. Right now as you well know, there's a very different product at Southwest versus AirTran. So we're already dealing with that. And that challenge will continue to grow smaller every single month. So AirTran will begin to shrink pretty rapidly now that 717s are moving out of the fleet. So that's going to diminish over time. I think more importantly is the focus that I mentioned. So for 2014, we have a lot of work remaining to finish the international technology work, make sure that that's up and running, so that we can finish the AirTran integration into Southwest. That's a tremendous amount of work with those 2 things. The remaining AirTran integration includes a conversion of 33 737s into the Southwest livery, and I guess around 62 more 717s into Delta's livery. So as you can imagine, there's a lot of work involved with that fleet conversion. In addition to that we'll be replacing, on an airplane-by-airplane basis, all of the AirTran 717s that are going out of the fleet. So, we have to ingest all of those airplanes. So that's the perspective, in other words, to your question. With respect to our brand, I think that we'll want to continue to protect the brand. We'll want to continue to focus on the friendly aspect of the brand, the low fare, low-cost nature of our brand and look for opportunities where we can improve the customer experience and drive more revenues. But specifically, with respect to tinkering with our brand, that's something that we'll be involved with here, thinking about 2014. And then we'll do the same thing again in 2015. So nothing to report you specifically yet but stay tuned.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","So your average fare was up 11% in the quarter from $143 to $159. Can you say what percent of that -- can you divide that by mix? Business versus leisure? Or maybe a different way to ask it is can we expect that level of fare, at $159, $160, to continue going forward?","Tammy Romo","We actually saw an improvement in our mix, really across the board for the quarter. So we saw nice, healthy fares and which of course, was fueled by the demand environment and just an overall, an improvement in the mix.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for my follow-up question, Gary, if there are slots or other things available as a result of maybe a settlement with American and the Justice Department, are you guys interested in expanding out in Washington for opportunities?","Gary C. Kelly","Absolutely. And I wouldn't restrict it just to Reagan. We would be interested in more slots at LaGuardia as well. So, I'm reasonably confident that there will be slots that become available. And then I'm assuming that there'll be an opportunity to bid. So if there is that opportunity, we'll certainly take advantage of the bidding. Last time the slots came up for bidding, we were outbid. So there's no guarantee that even if they're divested that we'll get any. But certainly, that's something that we are interested in, yes.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Godyn for Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, just on the last thing that you just mentioned there, that you thought you're pretty comfortable or confident, I don't remember what word you used, that slots were going to become available, is that sort of your view on whether we're going to see a settlement or not? I mean, is that the implication there?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, yes. I'm not trying to be presumptuous here. That's just under the assumption that the merger goes through in one form or fashion, it's my belief that slots will become available. Obviously, if it doesn't go through, then I'm not assuming that any slots come on the market. I can't imagine that the merger goes forward without requiring divestiture. That's been our position from the very beginning. And obviously, the Justice Department seems to agree with that.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fair enough. I just wanted to clarify. The 0% capacity growth rate for 2014, you guys went out with that number a bit ago, and it certainly seems, as you're looking at trends in the fourth quarter, that things are going quite well. Is there anything that can happen in the next kind of 6 months that would cause you to revisit that number? Or should we think of that 0% as truly a firm number that won't be revisited until even farther?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, no. I wouldn't lock it down that way. But it'll be plus or minus 0 based on everything that we know today. So you bring up the slot question in the same breath, and who knows? We may get slots that require that we fly, so we might need to increase capacity to take advantage of an opportunity like that. Again, this is just pure conjecture on my part to answer why would vary from that? Things could obviously change next year for the worse in the economy, and we might want to schedule less flights. So we'll definitely want to maintain that flexibility. But back to Hunter's question, we have a lot of work to do between now and the end of 2014. I would rather not introduce a lot of growth or even modest growth into that environment. I think we'll be very well prepared to contemplate growth opportunities after all the integration is complete, and I think we'll have a number of very exciting opportunities to think about. So really, now and next year is not the time to be thinking about that.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And Tammy, if I could just follow-up on what you said recently on business mix improving, is there anything you can tell us about sort of the last few quarters or just something to put it in perspective that puts how much it's been improving today versus some point in the past? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the trajectory there.","Tammy Romo","Sure. Just on our business mix. It did improve from the second quarter. I think we were at about -- I think we reported that we were about 30% in the second quarter of this year and that's up to about 35% here in this quarter. So, we have seen, when I was referring to signs of strength. That was kind of one of the reference points. Corporate sales also increased year-over-year. Actually, rather dramatically and -- so, just a lot of encouraging signs across-the-board.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just following up on John's question. When you're in a position to play offense again and start to grow, what are the relative attributes that you consider when deciding where to point your aircraft? Is it only a relative cost decision? And how has your experience in Atlanta changed your thinking in that regard?","Gary C. Kelly","Let me take a shot at answering your question and you can tell me whether I'm on target with your relative cost point. We'll be looking for opportunities where it can play to our strengths and where we can stimulate traffic, looking for nonstop opportunities where we think there's sufficient traffic that's perhaps underserved. And as we think about the future, I don't think that there's anything that's fundamentally different about how we would contemplate growing. I think in this environment, with higher fuel prices and having more of a challenge in stimulating traffic, we'll just be a lot more measured in pursuing those opportunities. Dallas Love Field is an obvious opportunity. I'm sure we'll face vigorous competition from DFW. So we're not willing to commit yet exactly what we want to do and when, for competitive reasons. But right now, we're just focused on bringing up our international capabilities and finishing the AirTran integration and not focused on growing the airline.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then, broadly, can you talk about the cost buckets that will help or hurt CASM next year? And can you provide any update on your pilot negotiation?","Gary C. Kelly","Tammy, you want to talk about the cost outlook? And then I'll try to chime in on the negotiations.","Tammy Romo","Yes. Our most significant cost reduction initiative, as you probably are aware, is our fleet modernization efforts. And so, you -- where you'll see those savings would be in our maintenance materials and repairs and our fuel and oil expense. And you're already starting to see some of the benefits in fuel efficiency. So those are going to be the primary 2 buckets where you'll see a reduction in cost. And of course, we'll continue our efforts, as always, just to control cost overall. And just a quick point on this year, if you recall, last year we went into the year with a goal to reduce our overhead by about $100 million and we're right on track with that goal. So -- and again, working through the 2014 plan, but -- as always, we're going to be very diligent in our cost control efforts.","Gary C. Kelly","Duane you specifically asked about pilot negotiations. So, I'll answer that and just comment on the rest. But the -- I think the negotiations are going fine. And in terms of what's being discussed at the bargaining table, as you know that's going to be confidential. But there's nothing really that I can report at this point other than we're continuing to have meaningful discussions. Our pilots are very devoted to Southwest Airlines and certainly want to make sure that their company succeeds. And I'm very grateful for all the hard work that our pilots do for us every single day. But I would be remiss if I didn't also share that we're in negotiations with many other workgroups. In fact, most of our -- the vast majority of our union contract employees, their contracts are amendable at this point. So, we have a number of negotiations underway and they are all proceeding and all -- I feel like we're having a very good dialogue. But otherwise, just really not at liberty to provide any other insight there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","We're certainly pleased to see the improvement in the ROIC and I wanted to ask to what extent do you think you're somewhat handicapped to achieve the 50% target without necessarily growing the ASMs more meaningfully beyond, let's say -- in 2014, let's say.","Gary C. Kelly","Why don't I take a shot at that and I'd love for Tammy to be able to comment as well. I don't think we are handicapped. I don't think achieving our return mandate is a function of growing ASMs. I think it is a direct function of us optimizing our route network. And as a follow-on, managing the revenue production. The other material input, of course, is fuel prices. And it is so nice to have stability in fuel prices. It's somewhat humorous to us that for 2 quarters in a row, we have the exact fuel price per gallon of $3.06 after all of our hedging for second and third quarter. And as I mentioned in my comments, the outlook for the fourth quarter is in that range. So that is extremely helpful. We want to maintain our low fare brand and not continually be forced to chase operating cost higher and higher and higher and higher. That's what creates so much instability in our [indiscernible] customer set. So -- well, we think we have very good revenue momentum, both I and Tammy have gone through the whole list of things with you that are not optimal yet. And again, just as a headline, I would say, we are in the midst of a major merger integration. And despite all of the noise that comes along with that, are producing record earnings here in the second and third quarter. So oftentimes, you see the opposite result. In other words, where people are really distracted and not performing. So I feel really good about where we are and Tammy and I and all of our leaders know darn well that we've got a number of opportunities that we can pursue. And that will be our focus. And as I said, our 2014 plan will have a result that achieves a 15% return on invested capital. I'm not guaranteeing that we can achieve it, but I am guaranteeing that we'll have a plan that provides that result. So Tammy, I think you want to answer?","Tammy Romo","Really, not much to add to that, Gary. Just, again, we're going to continue to be diligent on the cost side and of course, as we've demonstrated this year, we're very focused on managing our invested capital as well.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then you certainly do have a very strong balance sheet, which affords you a lot of flexibility. And I wondered to what extent would you consider increasing your capital return to potentially juice up the ROIC?","Tammy Romo","Well, I won't speak to our future plans, but I think you can just look at what we've done here in 2013 and I think that's just evidence that we're committed to manage that as aggressively as we can.","Gary C. Kelly","And we're very mindful of that. We have, last year in fact, we were very explicit that we were going to aggressively manage our invested capital. And Tammy pointed out that it's down, I believe, 9% year-over-year. So, no, we'll want to continue to do that. We've got very strong operating cash flow. I don't know anything right now about 2014 that would suggest that we won't have strong cash flow next year. There's always the things that are hard to predict, but like I said, we'll have a plan that will have a 15% return. And that will result in a very strong operating cash flow plan for next year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jim Parker with Raymond James.","James D. Parker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Following up on the questions about Atlanta, and when you all originally acquired AirTran, did you anticipate cutting back the number of flights to the extent that you have, or have you come up with better opportunities elsewhere that has caused you to cut back further? And then, what are your game plans for rebuilding service in Atlanta?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I'll speak to all of those and, Tammy, you chime in. When we struck the deal with AirTran, crude oil was a $80 a barrel. So we did not contemplate -- at that point, we didn't predict that oil would be at $110 a barrel. So I would say that. That has had a significant impact on, not just Atlanta, our entire domestic route system. So we've been trimming flights across the country. In fact it's a rarity to find cities that are having increased flight activity. The opportunity for many of our cities is to continue to add new destinations. But the short-haul markets, Jim, in particular, as you know, have really been hit hard over the last decade and have not recovered since 2007, '08 and '09. So, that would be my answer to your questions. No, we didn't plan on $100-plus crude oil. I believe we will have a substantial operation in Atlanta. We'll keep tuning it until we're satisfied that it's right. There is absolutely no mandate, whether it's Dallas Love Field or whether it's Atlanta that the flight activity has to be at a certain level. And the other thing I would mention about the number of flights, it's very misleading considering that the gauge, it's changing dramatically. So you'll be seeing 717s replaced by 737s in the trips. In other words, the trip count won't equate to the seat count and I'll just ask you to stay tuned on that. Atlanta is very important to us. We've had a wonderful reception there. Atlanta was a challenge for AirTran and we're seeing very meaningful improvements in the local market, in particular. So we have a big step coming up next month to convert to the point-to-point route system. If radical is the right word, it's a radical change for the operation. And the bookings, so far, look very solid. So I don't see a misstep there and am anxious to see if we can't build the business from here. At the same time, we are really hampered by the fact that it's not all one brand and the majority of the flights are still AirTran. And I think we're all looking forward to the day where it's all Southwest. And that will really put us in a position where we can best answer your question, and that won't be until the end of next year. So we've got a ways to go. We're very committed to the market. Regardless of the number of departures that we have, we're going to have a very large presence in Atlanta. Tammy, anything you want to add?","Tammy Romo","The only thing I'd add is, exactly what you said, we, in April 2014, we'll have 160 flights, which as you know Jim, compared to many of our other focused cities, I mean that's right in line with what we would traditionally do. So again, a very, I think, still a very strong presence there in April. And I think -- Bob, did you have anything that you wanted to add?","Robert E. Jordan","Yes, Gary, really covered everything. I just would tag in on the November schedule change. It's a big deal. We're moving from a hub-and-spoke structure there that AirTran had, to a traditional -- a little more smooth throughout the day flight structure that Southwest would have. It provides a lot better local timings. We're just a couple of weeks away from that and we were already gaining local share as compared to AirTran. And bookings, well, thoroughly the bookings performance for that November schedule look really promising. We're seeing gains locally and we're seeing that we're holding on to the flow traffic and connect traffic as well. So not only would that be a better schedule for our local Atlanta customers. It'll be a better schedule, I'm very hopeful, in terms of financial performance. And typically, with a big schedule change like that, it takes the market a while to adapt to the change in flight timings and we're not seeing any dip at all.","Gary C. Kelly","I just, Jim, have one quick color commentary to Tammy's point. Atlanta is one of the biggest cities that we operate in. Period. And it's bigger than Dallas, bigger than Houston, 2 original cities. Bigger than L.A., bigger than Oakland, the list goes on and on and on. So it's a very large operation for Southwest Airlines.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Glenn Engel with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk about international. How that's proceeding and when you hope to start flying that?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes. International is proceeding right on pace. We're probably nearing the point where we can publicly release some milestones. I'm not ready to do that yet, but 2014 is still the plan and it's going to happen. There are -- after the Bermuda closing, there are 7 international destinations that will be the candidates for conversion from AirTran in 2014 over to Southwest. And they'll take place -- those conversions will take place throughout the year. So to bring up international, Glen, we've got to finish the technology, be ready to take [indiscernible]. Then, we have to convert the AirTran International airplanes and there's 33 737s. Mike Van De Ven and his team will add some Southwest 737s to that international fleet, but all of those things will have to take place to get international up and running. I don't believe there's anything that we need to do with route authorities, but our regulatory folks are all over that. I'm not aware of any issues on that front. So it's, again, primarily just getting the airplanes converted and getting the technology up and running. The technology milestones are in view. And what we have reported consistently to you all, and especially in the second quarter earnings call, is that, that project is right on target, right on schedule. So, my confidence in the deliverable for next year just goes up with every passing day because we keep hitting every milestone that we've given them. The company's very focused on it, which is again why I've answered several questions the way we have today, which -- this is a big effort and it does require focus and we're really pleased with how the project is progressing. So I certainly don't want any distractions for our team.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And does the flat capacity guidance next year include any significant -- any international? And what percent of the system do you think it could become way down the road?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, it's really small now. Again, it's got 7 destinations and 33 part-time airplanes. They're not fully flying international routes. They're probably, I don't know, Bob, half of it is domestic. So -- is it 1%? Maybe 1% of our capacity today is international. And it's really premature. I'm not ready to give you the big prediction yet. I would simply say that the opportunity with 737s to North America, including Alaska, Hawaii, is 200 to 300 airplanes. That is not a prediction that we'll fulfill that, but it's a very large opportunity. And in many cases, the fares are very high. So, we think we've got ample opportunities to grow there as we do out of Dallas Love Field and other domestic opportunities too. So, we have no lack of opportunities. We just need to make sure that we're executing on our business plan and hitting our revenue and our cost targets.","Operator","And we have time for 1 more question. We'll take our last question from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham research.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Tammy, one quick clarification. Did you mention that codeshare revenue from AirTran was about $45 million for the third quarter?","Tammy Romo","That's correct.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got it.","Gary C. Kelly","And that's net, Dan. So that's not - in other words, there's a lot more codeshare revenue than that, but we don't think that it -- well, incremental, is the right word, sorry.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got it. And I think you just might have intercepted my next question, Gary and that is, I think the estimate earlier this year was about $1 million today and I guess I was just wanting to reconcile those 2 numbers?","Gary C. Kelly","Yes sir. Tammy, I don't know if you have the gross number here.","Tammy Romo","The total is, if I remember correctly, it's over $200 million -- it's over $200 million. I think $220 million, if I remember correctly.","Gary C. Kelly","It's a giant number, Dan, but we know full well that it's not all incremental. So we've made our best effort to try to infer from the data what is incremental.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Understood.","Tammy Romo","That's a big number.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then, I guess, just secondly. Does that codeshare benefit accelerate once the November schedules kick in, in Atlanta? How should we think of that?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I'll just give a topside answer and let Bob and Tammy think about your question here for a second. The connection bookings for Atlanta in the November schedule change look very good. And that may very well -- there may very well be some codeshare support in there. The only thing I would mention to you though, Dan, is that as time goes by and AirTran continues to shrink its fleet, which is happening now in an accelerated way every month between now and the end of next year, the codeshare numbers are logically going to come down as that entity shrinks. But yes, Atlanta is probably in a better position in November for codeshare.","Robert E. Jordan","I would agree, absolutely. Just simply because the flight timings are better, I'll think you're going to see a modest -- at least a modest improvement in the codeshare benefit. The other thing to think about too is the -- as the AirTran fleet draws down, the AirTran fleet, and we've all mentioned this, but it's suboptimized, so that the AirTran network is suboptimized as compared to Southwest. So as those aircraft enter the Southwest network and are optimized, you'll in essence, trade that codeshare revenue for even more effective revenue because it's part of an optimized network in total.","Gary C. Kelly","Right. And a much better customer experience too. Marcy, back you.","Marcy Brand","Well, thank you all for joining us today and as always, if you have any follow up questions, please feel free to give a call -- give me a call. Have a good day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion for today's call. I'd like first to introduce Ms. Ginger Hardage, Senior Vice President of Culture and Communications.","Ginger C. Hardage","All right. Thank you so much, Tom, and thanks to everyone. We know it's now time for the media to queue up their questions they might have for Gary, Tammy, Mike and Bob. So, if you -- Tom would give those instructions, we're ready for that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this is our media portion of today's Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Terry Maxon with the Dallas Morning News.","Terry Maxon","This is a North Texas question. I understand you're not going to give us specifics until you're ready to give us specifics, but can you kind of tantalize us about what changes we'll see in the schedule out at Love Field, both on -- beyond the Wright Amendment area and inside the Wright Amendment area?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, I think the -- beyond the Wright Amendment state area is, gosh, it feels like it's 1971 all over again. So, we've got lot of opportunities. We have a lot more opportunities than we have airplanes. So we'll be doing our best to prioritize what we do first and then just make sure we don't get the cart before the horse here. So, we're going to take this expansion opportunity like we would any other and be aggressive when we can and be cautious when that's what's called for. But, we've got opportunities, Terry, in every direction except for South. So it's, again, an abundance of opportunities there in some really high-fare markets. With respect to the Wright Amendment cities, we're not really contemplating any radical changes there. As I mentioned on the analyst call earlier, the short-haul markets -- and you've written about this, the short-haul markets have suffered over the last decade. We have already adjusted our supply to that reset of demand. And the other thing that will happen, of course, is that many of the cities, especially in Texas, are -- most of their flights are to Dallas. While being able now to expand Dallas will be very beneficial for those cities. So in other words, if we fly to the East Coast now out of Dallas, we'll have Texas customers that can now fly on Southwest via Dallas to that opportunity. And that's very substantial. So I think on balance, for the most part, there should be good new benefits for everybody and we're doing our best to make sure that we pay close attention to all of our cities that we serve and do the best that we can to take good care of them.","Terry Maxon","To follow-up on that. Love Field, I think you carried just under 8 million passengers in 2012. Is 10 million a year, once you get your schedule fully optimized out of Dallas Love Field post Wright Amendment, a reasonable target?","Gary C. Kelly","I don't know that I would put a boundary on it yet. We haven't even gotten started with it. It does have a natural cap and although we're -- because we're so efficient, I don't know exactly what that is. But I wouldn't object to that as a reasonable number, but I'm not willing to predict it at this point.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Koenig with the Associated Press.","David Koenig","Gary, just following up on the slots question that came up during analyst portion. Have you talked to anyone at American or Airways or even DOJ about that? Could you be part of some sort of prepackaged deal?","Gary C. Kelly","Personally, I've not had serious conversations with anybody about anything with respect to that merger. If somebody wanted to talk to us about a deal, well absolutely, we would talk to them. There's nothing wrong with that. But generally, David, we don't comment on what kinds of things that we might be doing. But just with this situation, yes, I'm going to give you a straightforward answer, which is no, I've not been involved in any serious way with anybody.","David Koenig","Okay. And the reason I asked of course is -- so you were -- your comments earlier were just -- you were surmising based on your long experience in the industry. It wasn't any particular inside information you had from any of the participants?","Gary C. Kelly","I have no inside information. And I - no, I think -- at least I tried to make it clear that I was -- I think what I said is, I was reasonably confident that there would be a divestiture required. And yes, that's based on our knowledge of the law and our knowledge of the slots that are hoarded at Reagan, in particular, and the fact that the Justice Department has sued to prevent the merger. So that's -- those are the inputs that I was using to voice that opinion.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kelly Yamanouchi with the Atlanta Journal Constitution.","Kelly Yamanouchi","You mentioned that bookings looked good in the shift to point-to-point for Atlanta and I was wondering how the shift for the November schedule has been affecting unit revenues and load factors for Atlanta? And also, how it has been affecting the mix of Atlanta O&D passenger share so far?","Gary C. Kelly","We don't know. Again, all I can tell you is what -- is repeat what we said before, which is, that the bookings look very good at this point in time compared to a year ago for Atlanta. And it is a very different operation. Bob is looking at these bookings in total. And what was interesting to us is that we did see a little bit more strength in the connecting bookings out of Atlanta. So -- but it's way too early to give you any insight along the lines that you were asking us. We'll probably need -- one day or one week doesn't make for a trend either. So we'll need some time to evaluate how good a schedule we have. I'm sure it won't be perfect and I'm sure there will be follow-on tunings that we'll want to do. And Bob, I'm pretty sure that we don't have every destination in place that we would like, much less all the frequencies.","Robert E. Jordan","Right.","Gary C. Kelly","So we've got a lot of work to do in Atlanta. And again, Kelly, the main thing to remember is, this is still dominated by AirTran brand and service. It's not close to being finished. So I'd say we're probably a good 18 months away before we've got something that we're totally satisfied with. But, this is a big step and based on the step that we've taken, we're very pleased with the results that we've seen so far. But all that's very premature.","Operator","We have time for one more question from Jack Nicas with the Wall Street Journal.","Jack Nicas","One thing, obviously, I think jumps out is the 11.3% hike in the average paid fare. Obviously, you folks are coming from a low base fare and then you're allowing bags to fly free, so still can be a deal there. But do you think that, that sort of increase significantly affected your strong revenue performance this quarter and do you think that this could lead to a trend of rising fares that would continue at Southwest as a result?","Gary C. Kelly","Well, just a little quick background, and then make sure I answer your question. The 11% is a little misleading. If you look at the average passenger distance that they flew, that's called the average length of haul, that was up 4.3%. So in other words, one would expect to pay a higher fare to fly farther. So you have that effect going on. 4.3% is quite a change in a year-over-year comparison there, so that's part of the 11.3%. You also look in the statistics, you'll find that the yields went up, what, Tammy, 6.2%, 6.3% something. That's probably a better indicator for how much fares went up year-over-year. And those are -- we're a low-fare carrier. Those increases are a function of cost pressures. And the primary cost pressure that we are managing is fuel. It is true that fuel moderated year-over-year, but again, we're dealing with catching up to fuel increases that have been taking place over the last decade. And finally, we're getting caught up. If fuel prices are flat next year, I would hope that we wouldn't have to have fare increases, but that's just an opinion. I can't give you any insight, legally, as to what we're thinking about with fares going forward. Other than the obvious, which is, we want to be a low-fare carrier. That's who we are, so we're going to work very hard to keep our costs low, so that we can pass those savings along to our customers.","Jack Nicas","Okay. And one quick follow-up. Obviously, you folks have bucked the trend of charging for baggage. Will you be able to stick with that and continue to allow 2 bags to fly free and simultaneously keep those fares low? Or is there an opportunity there to, maybe, along with everyone else, charge for at least a bag or 2 and then therefore, drop your fares maybe a little bit?","Gary C. Kelly","I believe we will. I would temper that with the following. Right now, it's our belief that we get more customers and more revenue by not charging for bags. In fact, there was a study that was released to the media this week, ranking Southwest as one of the most transparent, friendliest brands to work with, with the airline industry being ranked as a whole at the bottom. So we think that, that kind of a brand image brings us a lot of business that we would not get if we started charging for bags like everybody else. So there's a real value to being different than the herd and especially when you're different in a way that most everybody thinks, is really good. However, if -- over time, if customers prefer the unbundling approach, sort of an ala carte approach, and they understand it and they favor that, well, we'd be crazy not to provide our customers with what they want. But as I mentioned earlier, our focus right now to finish out this year and for 2014, is going to be, implement international service at Southwest Airlines, which is a very big effort, and finish the AirTran integration. A change in the fee structure would be, I think, a significant distraction. So, there are no plans to make any significant changes in 2014.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms Hardage for any additional or closing remarks.","Ginger C. Hardage","Well, thank you, all, for being on the call today. As you know, we stand by if you think of further questions as you're compiling your stories. That number to call is (214) 792-4847. Thanks, everyone, for being on the call.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation."]}}
