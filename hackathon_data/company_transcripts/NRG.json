My name is Chantilly, and I will be your facilitator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Chad Plotkin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Chad Plotkin","Thank you, Chantilly, and good morning. I would like to welcome everyone to our Year-End and Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live over the phone and through webcast, which can be located on our website at www.nrgenergy.com.

For complete information regarding our non-GAAP financial information, the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a quantitative reconciliation of those figures, please refer to today's press release and this presentation. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to your host, David Crane, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Chad, and good job. And I want to -- before I begin, I want to start by welcoming Chad to his new position as the Head of Investor Relations. And for the many people on the call who were friends and colleagues with our former Head of Investor Relations, Nahla Azmy, I just want to say how much we appreciate the work she did here for the past 8 years and wish her well in her new position at Energy Capital Partners. ","So today, in terms of the presentation, I'm joined, as usual, by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer, who will give part of the presentation. We have another member of the management making, I think, his first appearance in a speaking role, that would be Jason Few, who's the President of Reliant, who's going to say a few words about our retail business. And then we have Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer, who will also be giving part of the presentation.  Also available during the question-and-answer period to give answers about what's going on in the marketplace is our Head of Commercial Operations, Chris Moser. ","So as we normally do on this -- the year-end call, I'm going to spend just a little time reviewing the past year's performance before turning my attention to the period ahead. So if you're following along in terms of the slide presentation, turning to Slide 3.","For us, 2011 was a year in which we stumbled in August and the commodity price cycle moved against us throughout the year. But nonetheless, we finished the year almost exactly or close to the middle of our original guidance range for adjusted EBITDA. In so doing, the business, overall, showed its diversity and resiliency. And particularly, our solid results reflected the advantage that uniquely amongst the publicly traded IPPs. We benefit from a substantial portfolio of retail businesses, the financial performance of which tends to be inversely correlated to the direction of natural gas prices. ","In terms of our clean energy business, we're very proud of the success that we achieved in 2011 and moving over 900 megawatts of new solar power generation into construction. I am also pleased to report that all these projects are progressing well in construction, with no significant cost or timetable issues having yet arisen. This may seem like business as usual to you, but to me, it's remarkable to have a construction program of this magnitude, where every project is either on or ahead of budget and timetable.  You will hear and see a great deal more about these projects over the next 12 months, as units complete construction and achieve commercial operation. ","Finally, in respect to 2011, it was a year in which we made a lot of progress in readjusting our liquidity position to more normalized levels, and we did so not only by investing further in intrinsic growth but also in returning capital to our stakeholders. $581 million of corporate debt was retired in the course of our refinancings and a total of $430 million of shares were repurchased in satisfaction of our commitment made back in 2006 to return at least 3% of our market cap to shareholders through share repurchases on an annual basis.  I'd like to think of the supplemental 250 million share repurchase we did in 2011 as having satisfied our 3% commitment for 2012 as well, making it a 7-year unbroken streak. ","So let me move onto 2012 starting on Slide 4. On this slide and on the 2 that follow, I want to address 3 of our main themes for success in 2012. These themes will prevail even in a gas price environment, which we expect to remain bearish for the short to medium term. Theme 1, Texas is tight, and something has to give. Demand continues to grow as the economy recovers and the state's population expands. Supply is generally stagnant, with no new wave of construction on the horizon, as the price signals simply are not there for people to build new generation.","Of particular interest is the table on the bottom left of the slide. It plots Texas spark spreads in the forward market against projected reserve margins for each of 2012 through 2015. You see that notwithstanding the severely and increasing supply constraints facing the market, spark spreads have a long way to go before they approach new build economics. They also have a long way to go before they reach the spark spreads actually realized in 2011 as a result of last year's extraordinary weather. ","Weather, obviously, is unpredictable and equally, obviously, we have had no winter this year. But while the scorching and sustained heat of the summer of 2011 likely was an aberration, it seems equally unlikely that Texas will make it through next summer without at least one heat wave. So while gas prices remain in the doldrums, and heat rates have not expanded sufficiently in the forward market to incent new generation, we are positioning our wholesale fleet and our retail businesses to do well in a market where heat rates seem likely to expand.  Specifically, we are staying long in terms of the hedge position of our peaking fleet in Texas, and we have taken further steps to insulate our retail businesses from wholesale price spikes through a variety of mechanisms. ","Finally, we are ready with a portfolio of brownfield projects that we believe would allow us to bring more generation into the market faster and more inexpensively than our competitors, should peak period heat rates rise sufficiently to incent the addition of new brownfield capacity.  Through a combination of these factors, we hope to turn around the outcome for us of another tight Texas summer and turn what was a substantial negative for us in 2011 into a big positive in 2012. ","Theme 2 is retail, and looking at Slide 5. This is the business that investors love to discount, but in this commodity price cycle, I am not sure why. If you assume that the great risk to retail performance is on the wholesale side, subdued gas prices means that as a practical matter, the risk to retail revenue growth is not on the wholesale price side equation, but rather on the volumetric side as occurred to Reliant and Texas last August. But even having taken the heat of the ferociously hot weather last summer, Reliant ended 2011 with a full year adjusted EBITDA of $593 million, while having stabilized and actually grown their full year customer count for the first time in the deregulated era. ","Our objective, with respect to our retail platforms, is to strike a balance between customer count and near-term margin realization. And in that regard, I am very pleased with the path that we are on. Our retail businesses collectively generated over $650 million of EBITDA in 2011. And between Reliant's net customer growth and the significantly higher customer account growth achieved by both Green Mountain and Energy Plus in 2011, we are positioning our retail portfolio exactly where we want to be going forward. ","Our positioning in retail is most important, because it is a simple but undeniable fact that in this prolonged natural gas down cycle, the pendulum of value creation in our industry is swinging rapidly towards the end-use energy consumer, both in terms of metered customers and in terms of the beyond-the-meter market. And we, obviously, see our over 2.1 million retail customers in the metered market as one of our key comparative advantages, as we survey the opportunities available to us in the beyond-the-meter market.","More immediately, there is the EBITDA contribution from retail. Obviously, in our wholesale markets, low gas prices put pressure on dark spreads and cork spreads, reducing the financial contribution from our wholesale business and particularly from our base load plants. The low gas prices are good for business on the retail side, causing us in the bottom -- and this is shown in the bottom right quadrant of Slide 5, to modify the run rate guidance that we have traditionally given for retail in 2 important ways. ","First, rather than guiding to a rather illusory mid-cycle run rate, we have shifted the market assumption to what we feel we can achieve on a sustainable basis for the remainder of this extended commodity downcycle. Secondly, we have changed our assumption to include all of retail, not just the results from Reliant. The result is that we believe our retail businesses over the next few years are good for $600 million to $800 million of annual EBITDA. ","And finally, on Slide 6, in anticipation of Kirk's comments later in the presentation, let me make some preliminary comments about capital allocation. As you know, we have long anticipated the first quarter of 2012 as a time that we would refinance the 2017 bonds and announce a significantly sized stock repurchase program. The near collapse of the forward gas curve from December through mid-January has caused us to reevaluate our current position in light of our unalterable commitment to prudent balance sheet management. ","On the recommendation of NRG management, our Board of Directors has made a series of decisions set forth on this page. First, we will postpone the decision on a share buyback for at least a couple of quarters to see whether the commodity price cycle corrects itself to some sort of normalized level. While we are awaiting that return to normalcy, we will hold several hundred million dollars of cash in excess of the needs of our core business in reserve for our allocation to our equity investors or to our debt holders. ","Second, we will look to enhance those financial resources with additional liquidity generated by the sale of non-core assets and by the selective partial sell down of certain portions of our solar projects under construction, in a manner similar to what we achieved in the last few weeks in selling 49% of Agua Caliente to MidAmerican. We would like to amass some cash in the event the opportunity arises to acquire select assets or complementary businesses that may come available as a result of the current commodity price cycle.","Third, finally, and perhaps most importantly, after 8 years at this company, I finally have the pleasure of announcing our intention to initiate later this year a common stock dividend.  The relative merits of paying a dividend are known to all of you, so I will not repeat them here, but I will tell you that one of the absolutely key factors that enables us to declare a dividend now is our confidence in the long-term reliability of the cash flow stream that will fund the dividend. ","While we do not contemplate our dividend to be directly tied to the cash flow generated by our solar projects, the steady and foreseeable cash flow streams from the solar PPAs will underpin our dividend in 2012 and increasingly in the foreseeable future thereafter. Also importantly, this planned dividend announcement means that our commitment to return capital to our shareholders on a regular basis is alive and well. ","And with that, I would turn it over to Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2011 was a solid year in many respects, as I will discuss in the next few slides. But given the recent drop in gas prices, I want to focus most of my comments on how we are positioning our portfolio going forward. ","As you know, for the past few years, we have been engaged in a process to diversify our portfolio into one that can perform under multiple commodity scenarios. We believe our generation portfolio, with its diversity and merit order, and our integrated wholesale retail platform will not only withstand the low commodity price cycle but will thrive, as gas prices return to long-term fundamental levels. ","So starting with a quick look back at 2011 on Slide 8. On the environmental front, CSAPR was stayed on December 30 by the DC Court of Appeals, and while much spent much of the latter half of the year preparing to comply with the rule, the operational and financial impact of this stay on NRG is minimal. ","With respect to the Air Toxic rule or MATS, the final rule was issued in December with no major changes. This is the more important rule in terms of driving older, uncontrolled units out of the market and one that we can expect to fully comply with under our current environmental plan. ","After the installation of back-end controls at Indian River, our remaining capital spend for the next 5 years have decreased from $721 million to $553 million. On the development front, our EPC organization completed the Middletown project this past summer and it is in the process of testing and commissioning the Indian River back-end control projects. El Segundo Energy Center and all of our major solar projects continue to be on schedule. ","Turning to our plant performance metrics on Slide 9. We're very proud to have achieved the lowest recordable injury rate in our history, a measure that includes everything, from minor incidents to lost-time injuries, and for the second year in a row achieved top decile level in our industry. I want to recognize our entire plant operations group for leading this effort across the organization. Congratulations on a job well done. ","For the quarter, our generation was down 7%, driven primarily by a forced outage at our South Texas nuclear plant and some coal-to-gas switching in the Northeast. For the year, it was higher than 2010 due to the extreme weather in Texas in the winter and summer months. ","On December 28, STP Unit 2 tripped offline as a result of an internal electrical fault in the main generator. Repair work is in progress, and we expect to have the units back online in mid-April. The problem was isolated to the power side of the plant, and there was never a nuclear safety issue. And impact on Unit 1, nor was anyone hurt during the incident.  The financial impact of the outage was somewhat mitigated by the property damage and business interruption insurance, as well as low power prices. ","Our coal baseload portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well, with 90% availability for the fourth year in a row. And our gas fleet, which saw an unprecedented number of starts, improved their starting reliability under very challenging weather conditions in Texas. We have initiated a comprehensive program within plant operations to ensure we achieve the expected level of reliability as we approach the summer months. ","Now looking forward with our market outlook on Slide 10, and starting with natural gas. The warm weather, particularly, here in the northeast and record production levels have created a short-term surplus that the market is trying to rebalance through coal-to-gas switching and price-induced production costs. Some of the recent weekly production numbers are starting to show signs that producers are cutting back. But it is too early to tell how long the system will need to rebalance itself. ","One positive impact on our portfolio is that domestic coal prices have fallen as much or more than natural gas. As you can see on the upper right chart, since October of 2011, PRB spot prices have dropped more than pump natural gas. The one exception you see has been coal prices, which to some extent are impacted by the ability of producers to export into the global market. These dynamics will ultimately impact eastern coal generators, making their economics more challenging, and perhaps, more susceptible to early retirements. ","Now focusing on ERCOT, and just to add some comments to what David already discussed. It is clear that ERCOT needs more generation to keep up with the demand growth in Texas, and that forward prices are not high enough to justify new investments. ","In the bottom left chart, we compare forward on-peak spark spreads to the gross margin required to justify investing in a new combined cycle plant. As you can see, there is a shortfall to new build economics. ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission are well aware of this situation and have proposed a series of market reforms, which we have listed at the bottom right-hand corner. These reforms are designed to ensure that the energy-only market provides the appropriate price signals to incentivize needed new generation. We were very encouraged by the changes approved last week and the market's favorable reaction. ","Turning to Slide 11 on our hedging disclosure. We have increased significantly the amount of hedges for 2013 and 2014 over the last quarter to 82% and 57%, respectively. It was done through a combination of swaps and options. Our thought was to build a bridge out of the current bearish period to a future time, where we have a more constructive outlook on gas, supported by falling rig counts and production, coal retirements and LNG imports -- exports.  We think such a recovery is most likely to happen in the back half of 2014 or early 2015 and have set ourselves up for such an outcome. ","We will continue to be opportunistic in layering in additional downside protection. It's important to remember that we treat heat rates and gas separately and on their own merits. In this case, we chose to reduce our exposure to gas, while we continue to maintain our exposure to heat rates in Texas, where we remain bullish. As you can see in the lower left sensitivity chart, we have reduced significantly our baseload portfolio downside for the next 3 years. ","Finally, I am pleased to announce that we reached commercial agreement with 2 of the 3 Louisiana co-ops, whose contracts expire in 2015 -- '14. We look forward to working with them to gain the Public Service Commission approval for these extensions. ","As I mentioned earlier in my comments, I want to spend some time talking about how we're setting up our portfolio in this low gas environment and some of the levers we have that provide significant protection and even some upside. ","Starting with the chart on the upper left corner on Slide 12. We have seen gas prices this winter reach PRB coal parity in some of our markets. Given our hedge position, we're very well protected over the next 3 years. At low gas prices, we can exercise our put option on buying back our hedges at prices below generation costs, thereby increasing our margins. Of course, these opportunities are limited, given the flexibility we have in our coal supply and transportation contracts and certainly not sustainable in the long run.  But let me be clear, we have no plans on cycling baseload units overnight to chase small dollars. The decision will only be made if there is the right economic incentive. ","Now moving onto our heat rate exposure, we get a lot of questions about the potential upside of our gas leak in Texas. The chart on the upper-right corner is an attempt to help investors understand the value for our gas portfolio under tight market conditions. As heat rates recover in Texas, we will benefit not only through the open heat rate position of our baseload portfolio, but also with our 5,000 megawatts of gas generation. ","In 2011, we exceeded our FORNRG 2.0 program goal by $49 million, one year earlier than planned. The combination of reliability and efficiency improvements, along with cost savings across corporate and regional groups were the main drivers. Given the low commodity price environment, we continue to reevaluate all of our assets, and it will be a major focus of the operations group in 2012. Stay tuned, since you will hear more on this in the weeks and months to come. ","And finally, our retail business have demonstrated over the past 3 years that it can outperform in a declining gas price environment. We will continue to maximize collateral and transaction cost synergies between wholesale and retail as markets dictate. Given the more volatile pricing environment that we expect in Texas, we have increased the level of protection against weather events and price variability.","With that, I will turn it over to Jason, who in this call will provide the retail update and additional comments on our strategy.","Jason Few","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning. Moving to Reliant retail operations performance on Slide 14. In 2011, Reliant had another strong year, achieving EBITDA of $593 million. And we delivered on our customer count commitment by growing customers, providing undeniable evidence of our ability to leverage brand, sales channel strength, along with pricing to effectively balance margin and customer count. Additionally, Reliant produced its best-ever bad debt result, achieving 0.8%. Our solid operational execution was aided by the overall strength of the Texas economy. ","For example, Houston, Texas was the last major metro to enter the recession and the first to exit, achieving replacement of 101% of job loss. Additionally, nonresidential electricity usage, a rough proxy for regional industrial production, increased by 2.2% in 2011 for the greater Houston service area, adding further evidence of overall Texas market strength. Building on this strength, Reliant grew volume by 6%, Q4 2011 versus Q4 2010 and by 3% for the full year 2011. Volumetric growth was achieved by growing customer count by 2% Q4 2011 and adding larger mass customers to our portfolio.  Reliant also grew from virtually 0 to more than 2 terawatt hours outside of Texas. ","Moving to Slide 15. We remain quite positive on the state of our retail business, especially with our prospects within the Texas market, as we are now the largest retailer by customer count and volume. We began with our leading integrated model, which provides us collateral advantages in managing our portfolio and minimizing transaction costs. We expect non-integrated and less-capitalized retailers to face increased tightening, given the circumstances that occurred last February and August. As David and Mauricio discussed, our retail companies by comparison have taken meaningful steps to mitigate tail risk. ","What we believe is most compelling is the complement of our 3 retail brands that provide NRG the opportunity to occupy unique shelf space, recognizing the fact that consumers, both businesses and residential alike make buying decisions based on different factors. Harnessing the strength of Reliant, Green Mountain and Energy Plus provides NRG with an unmatched, multibrand, multichannel approach to the market and positions NRG well for cross-selling products like distributed solar, natural gas, home energy solutions and services, environmental offerings and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. ","From our perspective, while much of this may be nascent, success is most demonstrated by the fact that we have been able to sustain and expand our portfolio retail margins fourth quarter 2011 versus fourth quarter 2010. Plus we continue to have success in cross-selling services with over 500,000 customers using e-Sense products and 200,000 on home services solutions, which strengthened our customers' retention and expands our share of customer spent beyond system power. ","Finally, as we think about the expansion of the retail business, we want to assure you that our approach is governed by the same capital discipline exhibited across all of our businesses. In fact, our retail business is not only capital efficient, but it is also effective at acquiring and maintaining customers across all segments with high returns and very quick payback periods. ","With that, I will turn it over to Kirk to discuss our financial results.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Thank you, Jason. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 17. NRG is reporting fourth quarter and full year 2011 adjusted EBITDA results of $390 million and $1.82 billion, respectively. ","For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, our wholesale businesses contributed approximately $1.155 billion, while our retail businesses added $665 million. 2011 wholesale results benefited from a 7% year-on-year increase in generation sold or 5.2 terawatt hours due largely to acquired assets, including Cottonwood, South Trent and our solar projects, which collectively contributed 5.3 terawatt hours. ","The results were, however, offset by lower energy prices, higher fuel and transport costs and lower capacity revenues compared to 2011 -- or 2010, rather. Meanwhile, retail performed well in 2011 with Reliant contributing $593 million, having added more than 30,000 net customers during the year. However, competitive offerings and higher supply costs impacted results versus 2010. The addition of Green Mountain Energy and the newly acquired Energy Plus has further enhanced our retail portfolio by adding over 470,000 residential customers in Texas and the northeast. ","NRG's 2011 capital allocation plan both exceeded our expectations and struck a successful balance among the return of shareholder capital, prudent balance sheet management and value-enhancing investments. We completed the 2011 share repurchase program totaling $430 million or 20 million shares, which includes an additional $250 million above the original stated plan. As a head start on the return of shareholder capital, we intend to continue in 2012 with the dividend. ","During the year, we successfully refinanced over $7 billion of debt and credit facilities, significantly simplifying NRG's capital structure and reducing corporate debt by $581 million in the process. NRG also made great strides in advancing our utility solar program in 2011, and we now have over 900 megawatts of projects in construction or operations that are supported by long-term PPAs with high credit quality counterparts. ","Since year end, we have also completed the sale of a 49% stake in our Agua Caliente facilities in MidAmerican. And going forward NRG's liquidity will benefit from the sell down as MidAmerican will now fund its proportionate share of future equity contributions and other credit support for Agua Caliente, leading to a commensurate increase in NRG's 2012 capital available for allocation.  Finally, we successfully expanded our retail segment through the acquisition of Energy Plus, adding its unique sales channels and expanding northeast business to our growing platform. ","Turning to Slide 18. We are maintaining our guidance for 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $1.825 billion to $2 billion and free cash flow before growth investments of $800 million to $1 billion. The combination of our baseload hedges and wholesale cost management are expected to offset the impact of milder weather in early 2012 and a loss of STP Unit 2, which is expected to return to service well before the peak summer months.  Meanwhile, on the retail side, we will benefit in 2012 from the first full year effect of Reliant, Green Mountain and Energy Plus growing their businesses individually, as well as from their efforts to collaborate in certain sales channel. ","On Slide 19, our committed growth investments are broken down into conventional and solar investments. As I discussed last quarter, we have turned these committed growth investments to reflect projects to which we're either contractually or strategically committed.  Our total expected committed growth investments for 2012 now stand at $384 million or $441 million lower than the guidance we provided on November 3. ","The decreased spend in 2012 is due in part to the permanent reduction in budgeted capital, resulting from our partner share of the 49% of Agua Caliente required equity capital. The next component of the reduction in committed growth investment is simply the result of a change in the timing of equity contributions for our solar projects, the majority of which was funded in the fourth quarter of 2011. This acceleration of funding includes $130 million of capital previously expected to fund solar projects in 2012, which was accelerated into 2011 in order to fund the purchase of cash-grant-eligible solar panels prior to the expiry of the 1603 program. ","Finally, the remainder of the reduction in expected 2012 committed growth investments resulted from a combination of cost savings and improvements in financing at various solar projects, resulting in an absolute reduction in committed solar investments. While we made significant strides in 2011 in deploying capital to invest in NRG's future, we have maintained a solid level of core liquidity to satisfy the company's day-to-day working capital and collateral needs as shown on Slide 20. ","NRG ended 2011 with total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion or an increase of $150 million over the prior quarter end. As I discussed last quarter our liquidity position as of September 30 reflected the full effect of our equity commitments to our tier 1 solar projects. ","Changes in our liquidity in the fourth quarter were largely due to increases in LC availability, resulting from a release of solar LC postings, as we funded equity commitments to our solar projects, as well as further reductions in LC postings for ERCOT due to the significant decline in power prices after the summer months.  Looking beyond year end, we have seen a further increase in LC availability following our sell down of Agua Caliente. ","On Slide 21. As David mentioned earlier, we were very pleased to announce our intention to initiate NRG's first-ever common dividend, as our committed vehicle for return of shareholder capital going forward. Specifically, we intend to initiate this dividend of $0.36 per common share, which will be paid quarterly, beginning in the third quarter of 2012. Based on today's share price, this annualized common dividend represents a yield of approximately 2%, in line with the current yield on the S&P 500. ","In anticipation of our investments in solar and wind reaching their run rate equity distributions, we intend to provide shareholders with a tangible current return on these investments through a common dividend, which when combined with capital appreciation from our traditional wholesale and retail platforms, will provide shareholders with a more comprehensive return proposition. ","Our common dividend will be further supported by our overall free cash flow after growth investments, which based on our 2012 guidance, we expect to be a significant multiple of our intended annualized dividend.  We intend to grow this dividend over time largely based on the growth in our contracted renewable platform, anchored by our industry-leading solar business. ","While we intend the dividend to represent our committed vehicle for return of shareholder capital, we will continue to look to opportunistically supplement the dividend through share repurchases, providing a balanced approach for returning capital to shareholders. ","Timing and magnitude of any share repurchases will depend on NRG's share price, capital requirements, as well as availability under our restricted payments baskets contained in our bond indentures and credit agreement.  While currently, the 2017 notes represent the determining factor as far as RP capacity is concerned, we expect to have ample capacity under that indenture to pay the dividend following the initiation in the third quarter and permitting NRG greater flexibility to address any potential refinancing of the 2017s on a more opportunistic basis, should market conditions continue to improve. ","Turning to 2012 capital allocation on Slide 22. As you can see, driven by our reaffirmed cash flow guidance and the impact of the Agua Caliente sale, our anticipated excess deployable cash now stands at $700 million to $900 million, an approximate 20% increase versus our previous expectations.  The starting point for 2012 excess deployable cash is $405 million, which represents 2011 year-end cash, net of the $700 million target minimum that we will continue to reserve for NRG's working capital needs. ","The reduction in excess cash versus our third quarter expectations largely due to the acceleration of $130 million invested in solar panels that I've previously discussed. This investment provides us a scalable option to leverage a cost-advantage position as solar opportunities continue to arise. ","Of the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of cash available for capital allocation in 2012, approximately $500 million is already committed to a combination of growth investments previously discussed, scheduled debt amortization and a reserve based on our intention to initiate a quarterly dividend starting from the third quarter. ","While we now view the recent severe drop in natural gas prices as unsustainable, we believe it prudent to preserve the majority of our remaining excess deployable cash of $700 million to $900 million over the next couple of quarters to ensure NRG's balance sheet strength is maintained. While we remain largely within our long-term balance sheet objectives as of the end of 2011, we will look to remain so, taking into account the potential for a sustained low gas price environment. ","Finally, as David mentioned earlier, we intend to continue to augment our capital resources through additional partial sell downs of other solar projects in construction, as well as sales of non-core assets in anticipation of opportunities to acquire assets or complementary businesses, which may become available in this changing market environment. ","And with that, I'll turn it back over to David for his closing remarks.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Kirk. Ladies and gentlemen, we've taken a lot of your time already, so I'm going to be brief in summation. Consistent with our past practice for the first call of the year, we have listed on Slide 24 our most important 2012 objectives across our businesses. I'm confident that we'll make meaningful and measurable progress across all 3 segments of our business during what is likely to be an eventful year in our sector. ","Coupled with our focus on building and operating a set of core businesses that performs at the top of their peer groups is a focus on deploying the company's capital in a manner that generates a return to our shareholders, while protecting and enhancing our ability to increase the core value of the company for the benefit of the shareholders. We think and I think that the 2012 Capital Allocation Plan that Kirk just outlined strikes that proper balance. ","Finally, on Slide 25, we have displayed a diagram that tries to capture in simple terms the type of company NRG is becoming. Our future is not just about owning power plants, assets that no matter what fuel they consume are going to struggle to generate cash flow in wholesale power markets that are weighed down by chronically low gas prices. ","Our future is about owning a fleet of power plants that both enable and protect the thriving retail electricity business, which deploys a host of clean energy technologies to provide energy and environmental outcomes for individuals and businesses alike, utilizing a wide range of customized alternative energy products and services. We now have the pieces in place. Now we have to put them together and execute. ","And with that, operator, Chantilly, we're happy to take a few questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ameet Thakkar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ameet I. Thakkar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","David, I mean, in your remarks you indicated a desire to continue to grow the dividend. Just trying to understand, I guess, philosophically how you guys are kind of approaching that growth. I know Kirk mentioned the contracted generation portfolio will grow as the solar projects come online. But I mean, you're also looking to sell down 50% of the equity in those businesses and then El Segundo will come down -- will come online at some point. But to grow it further, I mean, what else is -- how else are you thinking about that, kind of, I guess what we see is kind of a finite number of projects in the portfolio right now.","David W. Crane","Well, Ameet, your question properly captured why we want to dodge the question that you're asking in the sense that we definitely think that this dividend can grow based off the strength of contracted assets. When you have one of these quarterly calls it looks like the solar business -- because a quarterly call is a snapshot in time, it looks like our quarterly business is static. A certain number of projects are going to throw off a certain number of cash flow. But, of course, that's not the truth, Ameet. It's a very dynamic business, with a lot of more opportunities. We\u2019ve talked about a tier 2 and a tier 3 set of development opportunities in terms of utility scale, solar. We're in the process of fast growing the C&I in the smaller-scale distributed solar. So we believe, off the strength of those contracted portfolio, we can grow the dividend. We're avoiding the question of at what pace we feel we can grow that dividend until we settle out the very question, the very point that you reference. We have a couple of sell-down opportunities underway right now. So I think over the course of the next couple of quarters and probably when we actually get to initiating the dividend in the third quarter, we're going to try and give you a better sense at that point based on what the portfolio looks like at that time, as to the pace at which we feel we can grow the dividend.","Ameet I. Thakkar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then there was a comment in your presentation about not having the restricted payment basket necessarily limit you for capital allocation going forward. Besides taking out the 2017 notes, what are the other means to which you guys could kind of work around that issue?","David W. Crane","Ameet, you've been around a long time. We've -- I think over the -- since 2004, we've bought back something like $3.2 billion worth of shares, and at all times, we had the restricted payment basket in place. And so there are a wide range of things that you can do, but I think probably the most noteworthy one is the one that you mentioned is we can just refinance the 2017. So as we looked at it, and looking at the RP basket in the future, we didn't think it was cost effective for the company, for the shareholders to refinance the '17s right now. But that's clearly one option, but there's the full range of other ways of expanding the RP basket that we've talked about over the past 8 years. So I think the bottom line for people who are concerned about the resiliency of the dividend that we announced today -- or the intention to pay a dividend that we announced today is that we don't see the RP basket as an effective constraint about us being able to pay the dividend for the foreseeable and the unforeseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Cohen of ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","David and Kirk, you mentioned that you're going to wait a few quarters to see what happens in the gas market before committing to an additional buyback. Do you have a minimum, long-term gas price in mind that would make you feel more comfortable with buying back stock rather than incremental delevering here? When I look at your Slide 22, it looks like you're pretty close to your target debt-to-EBITDA metrics on 2011 results. So how do you think about that?","David W. Crane","Jon, you came across a little bit faint, so I just want to make sure, you're asking is as we look forward and sort of think about allocating additional capital to buybacks or paying down debt, is there a minimum gas price that would cause us to pull the trigger on further buybacks?","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's right.","David W. Crane","Okay. Well, the short answer is I don't think -- I mean, I know for a fact that we haven't discussed a bright line gas price. But the factor that you focused on which was the company's ability to comfortably cover the debt-to-EBITDA metric, looking out in the future, is the key one. Kirk, do you want to add anything to that?","Kirkland B. Andrews","I mean, rather than thinking in terms of minimum gas price, I think we certainly would say we feel comfortable in the current reduced gas price environment, both as a function of the fact that we have the capital flexibility that I discussed previously, as well as the significant increases in hedging that we put in place. We don't generally give forward guidance about our outlook on gas prices, and importantly, heat rates, because certainly our EBITDA-generative power is a function of both. But suffice it to say, as I said, we feel confident in the current lower gas price environment and our ability to comprehensively manage those ratios moving forward. And it will be that management and our ability to do so that will determine the magnitude and the timing of any share repurchases that would go on to accompany that.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one other question. Can you talk a little bit about your net income expectations for 2012? And how the RP basket could grow under the old indenture using your current EBITDA guidance? And specifically, we've been looking at how the GAAP accounting treatment for some of the solar ITCs adds to net income and also to the RP basket as the projects reach COD in 2012 and '13. So how much could that add to the RP basket?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, the non-cash grant component, certainly, the ITCs would be an increase to the net income component from a GAAP perspective. And while we don't normally give guidance from a net income perspective on things, part of our outlook for the foreseeable future, in terms of net income, is what is contributing to our confidence, that as David said for the foreseeable future, we believe that net income, which as you know is the contributing component to the RP covenant under the 2017 bond indenture, it is sufficient to permit us to pay this dividend under that old indenture. And I think, importantly, that sufficiency gives us the time to pursue the flexibility of the options at our disposal, should we choose to expand that RP capacity through various means.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I have a question about your retail business. Clearly, it's been an incredible investment so far. And you keep growing your customer base, but I'm trying to figure out how are you actually doing that? Is that, that you're basically lowering margins to sign up new customers? And also, how should we think about the fact that you -- I mean you clearly must be offering lower pricing in order to sign up customers, especially in Texas. And yet, you have proposed market changes that will definitely make this retail market significantly more risky for you as a retail operator, given proposed increases and price caps. So could you actually tell me how you managed the risk versus the reward in this business?","David W. Crane","Angie, that's a multi-part question. And to answer one of your questions, it's going to take the combined intellectual might of myself and Jason. So I'm going to start to talk about 2 aspects of it. Let me ask Jason to focus specifically on Reliant, because, obviously, Reliant's the lion's share of it. But I would make 2 points, Angie. First of all, one of our approaches in terms of looking at retail is that we specifically don't want to just compete with the set of offerings that can only compete on price. So when we went out and acquired Green Mountain, and obviously, Green Mountain has a very distinct value proposition that involves environmental sustainability equally. So when we went out and bought Energy Plus, Energy Plus with their exclusive arrangements with various frequent-flier programs, loyalty programs, affinity programs, they also have a different approach that's not just based on price competition. So I think those 2 companies themselves have a very distinct proposition that doesn't depend completely on price. As to -- before I hand over to Jason, I also want to comment on your -- the rules, as they're changing in Texas, are definitely favoring the wholesale. And if you look at -- in the scheme of things, that's probably not going to be positive for any retailer, but in the scheme of NRG, where the wholesale business is still bigger than the retail business, it's good for us. And I will tell you that even for NRG's retail businesses operating in Texas, those rules are going to be a particular challenge that people that don't have the benefit of the wholesale supply to support their retail businesses. So in the long run, I would argue to you that for -- even for our retail businesses, which in Texas, obviously, led by Reliant, tougher rules on retail would make for a more rationalized competitive environment, which we think that Reliant can flourish with. And with that preamble, here's the main event, Jason Few to tell you how he adds customer count, while maintaining healthy retail margins.","Jason Few","If you think about our customer base, you have to think about it not only in terms of customer acquisition, but another dimension that drives customer count is your ability to retain the customers that you have. And as I talked about in my prepared remarks, I discussed the penetration that we've driven on our e-Sense products, as well as our home services solutions, which aids to our retention. And in fact, customer base, we actually see a higher level of retention. Beyond that as we look at acquisition, we think it is important that we leverage each of our channels differently. And so there's been comments about pricing and power to choose, that's one small channel, but we operate in about 9 different channels in which we acquire customers. Each of those gives us an opportunity to present a different offer to our customers with a different value proposition. And going back to the fact that customers make buying decisions on -- based on different reasons. We believe that we'll be able continue to maintain margins. We think that our value proposition allows us to deliver margins higher than the market norm, and that's reflected as well in the comments that David made as it relates to Green Mountain and Energy Plus. And if you look at Q4 2010 versus Q4 2011, our overall retail margins even at Reliant were basically flat. So we have a large customer base in which we manage pricing against the total portfolio, and we think with 1.3 million residential customers, as well as our commercial customers, we'll be able to continue to do that.","David W. Crane","Angie, does that work for you?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Yes, yes. I'm just wondering, because you are now showing that your sustainable EBITDA for this business in a low commodity price environment is about $600 million to $800 million. So is this driven by simply growth in your customer accounts? Or is this just a rebound in margins, because it's hard for me to believe that in a low commodity price environment, you can sustain the current level of margins. I think it's just that there's a lag effect, but those margins should actually compress eventually, right?","David W. Crane","Well, I think that what we've seen, I mean, that it's been a declining gas price environment now for 4 or 5 years and it seems that the margins have stabilized. And, of course, the $600 million to $800 million, I mean, I'm just restating the obvious here, Angie. This is more for other people on the call than for you, but clearly, we went from $400 million to $500 million in a mid-cycle to $600 million to $800 million. That's, obviously, boy, a great deal by Green Mountain and Energy Plus, both which are growing at a very, very fast rate. So there are a couple things at play here.","Jason Few","No, that's right, that number's reflective of all 3 retailers. Texas will continue to be a strong market for us, as well as the growth opportunity that we're seeing in the Northeast to aid that number. And we feel very confident that the 3 retail companies will be able to deliver in that range during this downcycle.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","And my last question is given how low PRB prices are, why haven't you added more coal hedges?","Mauricio Gutierrez","This is Mauricio. I think the drop in PRB prices have been contained to the front part of the curve. And as you know, we are pretty well hedged in 2012 and 2013. So as you go beyond that time period, the drop hasn't been that significant. So we're waiting for a better entry point to add on our hedges.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mauricio, you had laid out on Page 12 of the slide deck the upside to gross margin in Texas if sparks were to increase. Just to confirm, is this true with your existing hedges in place for 2012? Or would your hedge position somewhat reduce this up side, if sparks were to rise?","Mauricio Gutierrez","This is on an open basis. So think of the portfolio as completely unencumbered. What we tried to show here is what would be the incremental gross margin, moving from current spark spreads to what we believe are new build economics. And just the order of magnitude is about $150 million to $200 million, if we were to see spark spreads on the high 20s on peak for Houston.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, understood. So really, the sensitivity laid down on Page 11 that shows heat rate sensitivity, that shows very modest sensitivity for EBITDA to changes in heat rates for 2012, it looks like?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, yes, keep in mind that the sensitivity chart is only for the baseload portfolio. We don't disclose -- or we haven't disclosed in the past the position around our gas portfolio.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And for 2012, would this -- given the hedges that you have for your gas portfolio, would this sort of open sensitivity be materially lower?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, I will say that we have kept a significant part of our gas portfolio unencumbered, as David mentioned, and as I said on our last earnings call. And so I'm going to say significantly lower than these. But certainly, it has some hedges but not in great quantity.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And just as a follow-up for Kirk. Kirk, just as you think about the capital structure and credit profile, you laid out some very helpful metrics on Page 22. Given where we are today in terms of as you lookout at the forward curve and projected credit statistics, do you envision the need for material amounts of deleveraging? Or do you think given current market dynamics, as expressed in Forbes that you're generally in line with where you want to be from a credit point of view?","Kirkland B. Andrews","From the standpoint, while we don't normally give guidance in terms of our outlook on what those ratios look like in different environments. I think with the combination, as I'd said, of the hedges that we have in place in the near medium term, coupled with the fact that those have substantially increased, given the current market environment for natural gas and what we see moving forward on the heat rate component of things, while certainly, we feel comfortable with where we are from a balance sheet standpoint, given how that has -- how quickly that has moved around especially over the last month and the last quarter, that's the main reason why over the coming quarter or quarters, we're going to hold a little bit more of that capital back to actively manage that balance sheet moving forward. But in the current market environment, we don't see a substantial need for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","First question, David, in your prepared comments, you suggested something about building a war chest and maybe incremental non-core asset divestitures. Is there any incremental color that you can talk about as far as what non-core would be in this context?","David W. Crane","The question was what sort of non-core?","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes. How do you define non-core today?","David W. Crane","Well, I'm -- it's tough to talk about that too much, Brandon, because it can be demotivating sort of internally. But I think the sort of the most obvious one is that we're clearly a domestically focused company at this point. And we have some very valuable international assets, which we've looked at selling in the past and there are structural issues that make it difficult, different types of structural issues, both with respect to Germany and Australia. But there's more room for optimism now that those structural issues can be overcome. And so I would just leave that as an example. But there are a variety of other things around the portfolio that we could look at as well.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And on the solar sell down side of things. How do you -- what is the thought process as far as selling down versus not selling down? Presumably, there's, as it stands, a pretty nice return built into those projects. So what's the thought process? And what is the alternative, as far as cash deployment in a project versus just stock buyback or\u2026","David W. Crane","Well, Brandon, what I would tell you, we have a thriving solar development portfolio and a top rate development team. We have a finite amount of capital that we can put to work in the solar area. So one of the tried-and-true ways of being very successful in a development business is that if you can bring to financial closure well-structured power deals, there's always been a market for sell down. And if you can sell at a premium, you can sort of lock in the return that you were going to achieve from owning that project, over 20 years, you can lock it in and bring it forward. And that's, obviously, a very appealing approach. And so as we look at the solar now, and I would say this is one area where our investors should really grade our paper over the course of the year is that I think we need to demonstrate both at the utility scale, solar and at the -- in the sort of the C&I space more to distribute solar that we can arrange ways of financing these things that are optimal, in terms of use of the company's capital, because we are not a low-cost provider of capital. The other factor I would say, obviously, is the changes in the gas price environment are changing our own tax position. And so since a lot of investment in solar projects has tax attributes associated with it, we're, obviously, going to look to maximize or optimize the tax attributes of our various solar projects, both the existing ones and the ones that are coming down the path.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just real quick follow-on. Distributed versus utility, still thinking that near-term distributed looks like they have the biggest opportunity set? Or has that changed recently?","David W. Crane","Yes. We think over time, I mean, the way we think that the solar space is going to evolve in terms of going from big to small, absolutely everything that's happening in terms of solar economics is supporting that idea. We still have a good portfolio, as I mentioned, of utility scale, solar projects. But the size solar projects that we started in the second half of 2011, the 200, 300 megawatts sizes, that's not going to be a part of the future. It's going to get smaller, and the cost of delivering distributed solar, we feel is working its way towards, quite quickly $2.50 a watt, which again, it's impossible for anything from a grid parity perspective to compete with gas-fired generation when gas is $2.50 per million BTU. But competing in terms of retail grid parity, which distributed solar, that's the metric for it to compete against, we see solar being able to compete on a basis of retail grid parity in over 20 states within 2 years. So that's why we have to learn to go small with our individual solar project.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jay Dobson of Wunderlich.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Mauricio, I was hoping you could give us a little more granularity on some of the comments you alluded to on the coal-to-gas switching experience you're seeing. Particularly, in Texas, and I know you're a little insulated with PRB coal there. But just what exactly you're seeing? And then also, what you're seeing in sort of the PJM regions specifically for your assets?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, I mean, let me start with PJM. The coal-to-gas switching breakeven price, we think that is somewhere in the $5 range, so that happened a long time ago. And in Texas, just recently, this winter, due to the -- a combination of low gas prices and really mild weather, we have seen some parity against PRB coal prices. Clearly, we try to, at least, put some range on the chart on the slide that is subject to the actual prices of coal that you're hedged at and your transportation contract. But I think it's fair to say that when you have an on-peak price below $20, you will see some coal-to-gas switching. But I mean, we clearly have seen a pickup in gas generation, but this pickup has been at very low margins. And we will look at making the right economic decision to shutting down our units. But like I said we're not going to be chasing very small dollars and potentially increasing our cost structure or the wear and tear on our machines. So if we have enough visibility in terms of when we can buy back our hedges at a reasonable price over a long period of time, we will do that and bring our units down. That's as much as I can tell you, Jay. I mean, we haven't commented in the past about specific units and the operational status of them. So I'd rather just keep it at that level.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. No, that's helpful, Mauricio. And then, Jason, I know you all haven't talked very much about sort of customer growth and margin expectations, but could you maybe give us some idea what you're looking at, particularly, given the very solid experience you had in 2011 now that you're sort of including Energy Plus and Green Mountain and that legacy Reliant retail altogether, sort of what you're looking at?","Jason Few","Yes, Jay, we expect to see customer growth across our retail platform in 2012. And we feel very confident from an overall margin performance that we'll be able to maintain, if not expand margins in 2012 as well.","David W. Crane","Do you want to give a -- do you have any sense of -- are you intentionally avoiding the question of how quickly or how much you can grow customer count? You are intentionally avoiding that.","Jason Few","Yes, I am intentionally avoiding that.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I guess the last I'd go with is just sort of where we stand on the last Louisiana co-op. You saw contracted or recontracted, 2 of them. And what sort of indication that gives us for the last -- although, I guess that's out in 2014 as well.","David W. Crane","Well, the third one is -- Chris, you want to mention that?","Christopher S. Moser","Jay, this is Chris. The information we've received is that they're probably going to go with a separate -- with another supplier. I believe they've signed with Cleco. So I don't think that's -- I mean, from our perspective, we're happy with the 2 that we signed. We signed some other loads prior to these. I think we're in very good competitive shape, but they wanted to go a different direction. It'll have to go through the PSC as well, but I mean, we'll see where it all shakes out. But for now there, we don't expect them to sign with us.","David W. Crane","Thank you, all, for participating on the call. We'll look forward to talking with you next quarter.

For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and this presentation.","Now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, everyone, for your interest in NRG. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","Before I turn to our presentation, I would like to acknowledge Howard Cosgrove and Ed Muller for their years of service as directors on the NRG board. I want to thank them for their dedication and wish them well in their next endeavors.","Let me also congratulate our current Director, Larry Coben, on his appointment as Chairman of the Board. I'd also like to welcome our two new board members, John Wilder and Barry Smitherman. I look forward to working with both of them on all of the exciting opportunities ahead for NRG.","2016 was a pivotal year for our company. Just one year ago, I made a commitment to simplify our business, strengthen our platform and restore confidence in our direction and decision making. We have made significant progress on all fronts. Today, NRG is in a much better place to continue executing on our multiyear strategic plan to solidify our position as the premier integrated power company in the country.","Let's move now to slide 3, where I'd like to summarize the key highlights from today's call. First, we delivered on our numbers. Our track record of strong results and execution continued in 2016. We had our second best safety performance year on record and our integrated platform delivered earnings that were even stronger than last year. We grew both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth despite the difficult commodity price environment that reduced our total generation by 14% from 2015.","Our Retail business delivered its third consecutive year or EBITDA growth with a record adjusted EBITDA of just over $800 million. NRG's best-in-class platform has again demonstrated its ability to provide strong, stable results despite challenging market conditions. For these reasons, I'm also able to reaffirm our 2017 financial guidance. I want to thank all my colleagues for a job well done on a very successful year.","Second, we executed on our priorities. Our focus over the past year in simplifying and streamlining our business resulted in over $0.5 billion in cost reductions. We made progress in repositioning our portfolio by selling assets at value, and executing several capital projects on time and on budget. We strengthened our balance sheet by reducing corporate debt by $1 billion and extending $6 billion of debt maturities well beyond 2020. Last, we reinvigorated our strategic partnership with NRG Yield by putting in place a dedicated management team and expanding our Renewables business and ROFO pipeline.","Third, we're not done yet. As we closed out the first phase of deleveraging, cost cutting and business optimization efforts, we now turn to the next phase of our plan. We're in a much better position today to benefit from market opportunities than we were one year ago.","But before discussing details of our 2016 results and 2017 plans, I want to remind you of what underpins our continued strong results and sets NRG apart from others in the industry on slide 4. NRG's differentiated business model is simple and focuses on our competitive advantage; the integration of Generation, which includes Renewables and Retail. This integrated platform and the touch points between these primary businesses allow us to capture operational and commercial synergies in a way that makes the whole of our business greater than the sum of its parts.","NRG's unique value proposition centers on stability. Our diverse portfolio minimizes our exposure to market and fuel-specific downturns, while our diverse business lines create a stable base of free cash flows, particularly the natural hedge between Retail and Generation. In 2017, we're estimating the three-quarters of our gross margin will come from stable sources, such as retail, contracted assets, including NRG Yield, and capacity revenues. We have built a business that is not dependent on commodity prices to deliver strong results, but that remains well positioned to benefit from upside in a commodity market we cover.","As we manage our business for stable, visible free cash flows, we maintain the ability to grow and quickly replenish capital. We achieved these through our strategic partnership with NRG Yield, which serves as another unique differentiator of our business and is an important driver of our ability to participate in the growing Renewable segment.","Turning to slide 5, I want to reiterate my belief that the competitive power sector is in a period of unprecedented disruption. Changes in fuel mix, consumer preference, technological innovation and increased distributed generation have put pressure on the traditional IPP model, particularly as commodity markets continue to weaken. While sufficient at the outset of competitive markets, I believe the IPP model is now obsolete and unable to create value over the long term.","On our fourth quarter call last year, I highlighted the six elements that I believe are now required to succeed in the competitive power sector. These, starting with excellence in operations and execution; diversification, both in terms of Generation portfolio and business lines; and a scalable platform for growth. NRG was already strong in these three areas and the results achieved throughout the past year further confirm this assessment.","So, our focus turned to the remaining three attributes. First, we needed to ensure that we were operating a platform efficiently. This meant simplifying by focusing on our core Generation and Retail businesses and divesting from non-core and underperforming businesses. Furthermore, we focused on reducing costs, taking over $0.5 billion out of NRG's total cost structure. These combined efforts have greatly strengthened our business compared to where we were one year ago.","The remaining attributes required implementing a more flexible, transparent approach to capital allocation and achieving a more resilient capital structure given the sustained low commodity price environment. As a result, we refocused a substantial amount of our capital to deleveraging in 2016, freeing up additional capital by adjusting our dividend policy. Importantly, we also changed the way we allocate capital for growth by refocusing on projects that offer high returns and quick paybacks.","Going forward, you can expect the same discipline we brought in 2016 to be applied to the next phase of execution. And I will continue with my philosophy of no head scratchers when it comes to understanding how we allocate capital. And with a focus on the new Business Review Committee well aligned with our strategic priorities, we look forward to its role in our review process and the continued execution on the three priorities outlined here.","Turning to slide 6, I'd like to provide you more detail around our cost reduction initiatives and the next phase of our plan as we move into 2017. I am very pleased to report that not only have we already achieved our $400 million total cost savings target, we have exceeded it, reducing our total cost by $539 million compared to our 2015 baseline. Reducing our cost was not just the focus of management, but a focus of all employees throughout our organization, and I am very pleased with the progress we have made to date.","My promise to you was to not only hit our targeted cost savings, but to report our savings in a way that was more transparent and held us accountable. The left side of the page is a view of our total cost structure, sales and marketing, G&A, O&M and development. As you may recall, last year we combined all of our cost savings initiatives under one comprehensive program, but you can still track individual items in our 10-K disclosures.","With our current target met and exceeded ahead of our initial timeframe, we continue on our focus on streamlining and optimizing our business. We are already working on our next round of forNRG cost-cutting initiatives. But given the scope of the Business Review Committee, it is appropriate to delay a public announcement of the new set of targets until later in the year.","Now turning to slide 7, as I discussed earlier, the breadth and scale of our platform is a clear competitive advantage. But I also understand that it can complicate the ability to properly unpack our cost structure. The objective today is to help further simplify the investment proposition by enhancing the visibility into our cost structure. While I will discuss the highlights in the slide, the full detail behind these numbers can be found on the appendix of today's presentation and will map to our 2016 10-K disclosures.","As I'm sure you're all aware, comparing costs from one company to the next can be challenging. So before I get into detail, let me put more context around this analysis. First, given the business and technology diversity that drives our integrated platform, benchmarking NRG's consolidated cost to those of a pure IPP is simply not correct. So, in our disclosure, we have isolated the cost structures within each of our reported businesses as a means to compare our cost to appropriate peer companies.","Second, costs are somewhat fungible between different categories. And even within the small competitive power group, there are notable differences in cost categorization. To account for this difference, it is important to capture these combined costs, both expensed and capitalized, to fully appreciate a company's baseline cost structure.","Now, going into the detail on each of our segments. In Generation, I want to remind you that our current Generation business is the result of consolidating four generation companies over the past five years, NRG, RRI, Edison Mission, and Mirant. And during this time, significant cost synergies were realized as part of the integration efforts.","This discipline continues today, and on an adjusted basis, our Generation segment carries a total cost of almost $50 per kilowatt, a number that is slightly lower than that of our closest peers. For this business, we focus on $1 per kW metric given that a substantial portion of our fleet in the Northeast is reliability focused, capturing significant capacity and scarcity revenues, while generating a lower number of megawatt hours.","In addition, to maintain comparability, we have backed out cost associated with our nuclear unit ownership that NRG is the only competitive power generator with this higher fixed cost, lower fuel cost technology. While our generation cost per kW are in line with our peers, we're continually focused on driving further cost savings by improving upon efficiencies in fleet operations and asset optimization efforts.","Next on Retail, with nearly 3 million customers, most of whom are residential customers located in Texas, NRG operates the leading residential retail platform in the country, and the stable margins from Retail are an important driver of our free cash flow each quarter.","Our Retail business maintains a relentless focus on meeting evolving customer needs and on continuous improvement, which have driven expansion of both our customer base and earnings. Benchmarking cost in Retail is difficult given the differences in customer, product and regional mix from one company to the next, and because other retailers provide little visibility into the breakdown of their cost structures.","Finally, moving to Renewables, as I highlighted earlier, Renewables are a pillar of our growth and portfolio repositioning. Today, NRG, together with NRG Yield, has one of the largest renewable energy platforms in the country, and we're able to leverage our expertise within our other segments to continue to develop and operate this fleet. The operating cost as reported for NRG's Renewables segment is $91 per kW. But important to note, this includes assets such as the Ivanpah concentrated solar thermal facility, which has a higher cost structure given the emerging nature of this technology.","The more appropriate metric is that of our combined Renewables segments in NRG and NRG Yield, which captures the full cost structure of our renewables operations across our entire fleet. This combined view cost of $67 per kW, as you can see, is in line with peers, and we continue to improve.","Since we reintegrated our Renewables group last year, we have driven further improvement in this area through transitioning large portions of our fleet to sales performance of O&M. Additionally, we are focused on adding simpler mainstream technologies to our fleet with a core focus on utility-scale solar, which can be operated at $20 per kW and utility-scale wind at $50 per kW. As a result of these initiatives, you should expect our Renewable cost structure to step down over time.","The goal of the disclosures is to provide you greater visibility into our overall cost structure and the metric that you can compare to peers. But what I want to make clear is that being in line with peers does not mean we're done looking for areas to improve. Assessing and reducing our costs is an ongoing process and we will always aim for increased position.","Now, on slide 8, I'd like to provide a summary of the many ways in which we repositioned our portfolio during the past year. As part of our normal course of business, we put our entire portfolio through a rigorous review process. The result can lead to everything from fuel conversions to asset sales, to realigning our portfolio to the most compelling market opportunity.","In 2016, we took significant steps to strengthen our generational fleet. We sold four assets at value for $550 million, exceeding our original target by 10%. We modernized our fleet and converted 2.2 gigawatts of coal plants to natural gas, benefiting from lower gas prices and capacity revenues. We brought online our first of a kind carbon capture facility, Petra Nova, on time and on budget.","We pursued growth opportunities in both conventional and renewable plants, looking for areas of quick capital replenishment as highlighted by the 1.5 gigawatt renewable portfolio acquisition from SunEdison that we closed last year. For this transaction, we have already recovered 100% of our total utility-scale purchase price, with just the first 265 megawatt dropdown to NRG Yield. This means we have over 1 gigawatt of projects in this portfolio at effectively zero cost.","Looking forward, we will continue our rigorous review process, assessing the current market and developing solutions that optimize our fleet and strengthen our platform. I would expect these to include further asset dispositions at value.","Turning to slide 9, I want to provide an update on our Capital Allocation Plan. As I laid out on the fourth quarter call of last year, my primary objective for capital allocation was to ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital, and provide our shareholders with greater visibility into our capital allocation decision making.","In an effort to begin to better align to the market cycle, the transition in capital allocation mix between 2015 to 2016 reflects the recognition that we needed to focus our efforts more on deleveraging, and leave no doubt on our ability to withstand a prolonged period of low commodity prices.","For 2017, we will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and pay down debt, expanding our current program with an additional $200 million through the end of this year. Approximately 70% of every dollar we allocate will go toward this effort as we aim to maintain a cycle-appropriate level of leverage. This will ensure we have the financial flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities when the market recovers.","We will also continue to pursue low-cost options for growth where we have an ability to generate the strong returns in a relatively short period of time, which can be viewed as temporal capital for NRG.","So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk now for the financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on slide 11, before I review the full-year results, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a change we've made to both our segment disclosure for 2016 and our guidance breakdown. We're now combining both Mass Retail and Business Solutions into a single Retail segment in order to bring all of our direct customer-facing businesses together as a single segment.","Business Solutions, which consists of our C&I, demand response and other B2B initiatives, was previously part of the Generation segment. Our results for 2016 as well as our guidance for 2017 now reflect this change, which we believe will provide greater clarity of disclosure in helping our investors better understand the NRG value proposition.","Turning to 2016 financial results, NRG delivered $3.257 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Our results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped Retail deliver $800 million in adjusted EBITDA. Mass Retail contributed $755 million of this total, in line with the midpoint of our latest guidance for Mass Retail, which was announced on our third quarter call.","Generation and Renewables achieved $1.547 billion in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield, aided primarily by robust wind conditions through the year, contributed $899 million. We ended 2016 having completed $1 billion of our $1.4 billion corporate debt reduction program, the balance of which is part of our 2017 capital allocation to retire the remainder of our 2018 bond maturity.","When combined with the retirement of our convertible preferred and the extension of corporate debt maturities at more favorable rates, including the recent refinancing of our term loan, which occurred in January, our deleveraging efforts have generated in total almost $100 million in annual interest and dividend savings, significantly improving NRG-level free cash flow.","Earlier this month, NRG received $128 million in net proceeds from a new, non-recourse HoldCo debt financing at Agua Caliente. In addition, NRG and NRG Yield have now entered into an agreement to complete the dropdown of a 31% \u2013 of 31%, rather, of NRG stake in Agua Caliente as well as the Utah solar assets acquired late last year as a part of the SunEdison transaction for a total of $130 million.","Having previously realized $48 million in financing proceeds from additional debt financing for the Utah solar assets late last year, these 2017 transactions, which I'll review in a greater detail shortly, are expected to result in additional cash proceeds to NRG of over $250 million, increasing 2017 capital available for allocation.","Next, I'd like to briefly address an element of our 2016 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow, the non-cash impairment charges of $1.2 billion incurred for the year. Over the course of 2016, we impaired a number of assets due to changes in the market affecting these specific projects for a total of approximately $300 million through the third quarter. And in addition, on an annual basis, we tested our long-lived assets and goodwill for potential impairments.","Given a prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices, which resulted in additional non-cash impairment charge of approximately $900 million, consisting primarily of a write-down of certain fixed assets in California, Texas, Pennsylvania, as well as the remaining goodwill on the Texas assets. This non-cash impairment charge has no impact on EBITDA or free cash flow, and we are reconfirming our guidance for both 2017 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for growth.","Turning to slide 12 to review our plans on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation, we expect approximately $1 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2017, which represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash reserve for liquidity that supplements our corporate credit facility.","2017 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at the end of 2016, supplemented with the closing of the Agua Caliente financing in February, plus the midpoint of our 2017 NRG-level free cash flow before growth guidance as well as the proceeds from the dropdown of the Utah utility solar assets and the 16% interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield of approximately $130 million, and that is expected to close this quarter.","We expect to allocate approximately 70% of NRG-level capital in 2017 towards further debt reduction. This consists of non-discretionary debt amortization of both the NRG term loan and the payments to the counterparty in connection with the Midwest Generation monetization transaction in 2016, which are treated as principal payments from an accounting perspective.","The balance of capital toward debt reduction is discretionary and consists of $400 million toward the retirement of the remainder of our 2018 maturity, which was previously committed, plus an additional $200 million towards more corporate debt reduction, which we are announcing today. We will remain flexible as to the tenure of debt to which this additional $200 million is allocated. However, the most likely scenario is we will deploy this capital toward retiring the remaining balance of our 2021 senior notes.","These notes are currently callable and the call price will step down again in May. Prior to this allocation, we're already on track to achieve our target debt ratio in 2017, which we continue to see as a trough year based on the forward curves. This additional debt reduction not only further strengthens our balance sheet and extends our nearest unsecured maturity to 2022, it also represents an attractive risk-adjusted return.","We plan to hold our dividend at its current rate of $0.12 per share on annualized basis, representing about 4% of our capital for allocation. And finally, in 2017, we expect approximately $185 million of growth investments, primarily consisting of our investments at Bacliff, Puente, Carlsbad, and the remaining capital required for the Petra Nova project.","Turning to slide 13, I'd like to provide some further details on the dropdown transactions and related financings, which highlight in particular the rapid return of capital achieved from the SunEdison transaction as Mauricio mentioned earlier. Looking at the left half of the slide, as I mentioned, we have already closed on additional project-level financings for both the Utah solar assets we acquired as a part of the SunEdison utility-scale transaction, as well as our 51% stake in Agua Caliente. When combined with the expected proceeds from the dropdown of our equity stake in Utah as well as a portion of our stake in Agua Caliente, which we expect to close in the current quarter, total proceeds from these transactions to NRG is approximately $300 million.","In connection with the dropdown transaction, NRG and NRG Yield also agreed to expand the ROFO pipeline to include two additional assets from the SunEdison transaction, enhancing the growth pipeline for Yield and expanding potential capital replenishment for NRG.","Looking at the right half of the slide, and importantly, less than six months after closing the SunEdison utility-scale transaction, NRG is on track to replenish more than 100% of the total purchase price, while retaining a zero-cost option on the balance of that portfolio, which includes both the late-stage pipeline, which is now part of the expanded NRG Yield ROFO, as well as more than 1 gigawatt of additional opportunity.","As shown on the lower right of the slide, the proceeds from the Utah solar debt financing, which closed late last year, and the Utah solar portion of the NRG Yield dropdown, which will close shortly, total $129 million, exceeding the price paid for the entire SunEdison transaction by $5 million.","And finally, slide 14 provides an update on corporate credit metrics. Starting with 2016, having repurchased a portion of our 2018 and 2021 notes during the fourth quarter, we've completed our 2016 delevering objectives driving corporate debt to $7.8 billion. Based on the midpoint 2016 guidance, this implies a corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio of just over 4 times.","Turning to 2017 metrics, having now allocated that additional $200 million in corporate-level debt reduction, total corporate-level debt reduction in 2017 is just over $600 million, putting us on track to reduce corporate-level debt to $7.2 billion. When combined with 2017 corporate EBITDA based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance, this now implies a 2017 debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.13 times.","Importantly, while our target ratio is based on gross corporate debt to EBITDA, for comparative purposes, I've now added the implied net debt to EBITDA ratio at the bottom of this table, using actual corporate-level cash in 2016 and implied year-end 2017 cash by adding the current balance of unallocated 2017 capital with the year-end 2016 balance. These implied net debt ratios are approximately 3.75 times in each of 2016 and 2017.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kirk. And to close on slide 16, I just like to summarize our main priorities as we move into 2017. You may notice similar themes to last year. This is because our focus on continuous improvement and our strategic objectives remain the same. We will continue to work towards perfecting our integrated platform, seizing market opportunities to grow, and demonstrating leadership in the competitive power sector.","And we will enhance our business by remaining focused on operational excellence, reducing costs, strengthening the balance sheet, and repositioning our fleet. We continue with the process of seeking a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, where we are in active dialog with bondholders, and expect to provide more clarity next quarter.","With a solid foundation put in place this year, we can continue on executing our strategy to drive greater shareholder value in the months and years to come.","So with that, operator, we're ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the additional disclosure on the cost structure, and congrats for exceeding your cost cutting targets. Just a few questions on your SG&A, for 2017, what is built into overall guidance in terms of your overall SG&A position?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Let me turn it to Kirk, specifically. But for 2017, on our guidance, we included the $400 million target that we had on our cost reduction initiatives. Is that what you wanted, Stephen, or what level of specificity you need?","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, I was thinking just in terms of the \u2013 just the aggregate SG&A amount for the entire company for 2017. How should we be thinking about that aggregate level in 2017?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, as we move into 2017, I think when you look at the additional disclosures that we have on the, I believe it was, slide 6, for 2016, you should expect that we're going to continue to focus on reducing our cost structure overall. And at the very least, when it comes to SG&A, not only we're going to hold the line, but as I mentioned on my prepared remarks, I think it's difficult given the initiative that we're going to go through in the Business Review Committee to put a specific target as we have done in the past. So, I hope that you all indulge us with holding on to, I guess, the direction that we have provided in terms of our new FORNRG program, our new cost initiatives. But there is a lot that we're going to go through in the next couple of months in revising our entire businesses around the company.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very much understood. Shifting gears over to something you mentioned in your remarks about asset dispositions. You mentioned that there's potential for additional asset dispositions. Without getting too specific, what types of assets should we be thinking about in terms of the most logical candidates for disposition?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","I mean, I think it's similar to what we did in 2016. I mean, we went through a very thorough review process on assets that were not necessarily core on specific regions, that were single assets that have been underperforming. But the most important thing to me is, if we can actually monetize assets at value. And that's what we're going to be focusing on, on the next steps of asset dispositions. As I've said in the past, we ended up with a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts of generation through a number of acquisitions, and it is the time now to be pruning around that portfolio and to recalibrate and resize that portfolio. But we will only do that if we can actually monetize assets at value, like we did last year where we set a target of $500 million and we came in a little over $550 million.","So, I think that's how you should be thinking about the asset optimization efforts going into 2017. And of course, I mean, now that we have a new framework around the Business Review Committee, we will have a conversation about single assets. But every part of our business and \u2013 evaluate that and make a determination in the next couple of months, which I will be in a position to announce to you later in the year.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very good. I'll give time for others. Thank you very much.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is open.","Antoine Aurimond - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. This is Antoine actually covering for Julien. How are you?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good. Good morning. How are you?","Antoine Aurimond - UBS Securities LLC","Good. First, can you expand a little bit on where the incremental $139 million savings were made, both in terms of O&M versus SG&A and also by business unit?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. So, the first thing I think it was important to \u2013 as we go in through this period of asset rebalancing and asset optimization, I feel it was important to provide you with the total cost reduction on the platform, and not only focusing on one specific category. So, what we attempted to do was provide you with the entire cost platform of the company. Some of the additional cost reductions happened around asset dispositions that we've made. And it is important, as we go in through this asset rebalancing, that we have the transparency to provide you the level that you need to be able to compare where we were before and where we are today.","I will also say that a lot of the over-performance happened just across all the different categories; SG&A, O&M, selling and marketing. So, there is not just one area to pinpoint. But I think it was, as I mentioned, completely across the organization.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","And just to add on \u2013 it's Kirk. I mean I think this is part of one of the pages that Mauricio spoke to in the total cost comparison versus the baseline, on which those cost targets were set. This is what we achieved in 2016. And I think we had about $130 million in SG&A and marketing savings, about $300 million in O&M, and another $100 million of rounding in development. If you recall, I mean our original target of $150 million, as we said in the reset, which was a part of that $400 million, was to come from G&A, marketing and development. So pursuant to what I just described, the combination of those two elements in terms of savings between the baseline and 2016 is more like $230 million. So, that gives you a directional sense of at least where that component of the overage came from.","Antoine Aurimond - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you. And on the $400 million of excluded part of the Generation business, how much of that is non-recurring? And also, how do you think about your initiative of IPP going forward?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","In terms of non-recurring, and I believe you'll find a walk of that in the appendix. Always hate to refer to pages deep in the appendix, but I understand this is an important question. I think it's back on page 35 of the appendix. The only really non-recurring of that deduction is some non-cash gains or losses, and most of those are losses, related to just retirements or write-offs of small assets and inventory and the like.","The bulk of that, excluding the component that we obviously left to the side that's associated with the cost of the South Texas Project, the nuclear asset, and we did that obviously for comparative purposes. We're the only IPP among the three that Mauricio had spoken to that has a nuclear asset. The remainder of that are \u2013 it's a list of different things. It's deactivation costs for deactivations that took place, obviously, those megawatts are not included; ARO or asset retirement obligation expense; the purchase accounting effect of lease accounting for some of our acquired assets that are under lease. And the remainder of that is, basically, just lease expense, which is really more of a financing charge that's largely associated with the GenOn and a subset of that is, obviously, the Midwest Gen asset. So, that's non-recurring and more just not what you think about as traditional O&M and SG&A, or maintenance CapEx.","Antoine Aurimond - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Just wanted to be \u2013 sort of make sure I state the obvious and understand that the guidance you've given for EBITDA and free cash flow this year does not include anything that might result from the strategic review currently underway in terms of incremental cost reductions, asset sales, et cetera?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, Greg. Good morning and, yes, that is correct. I mean, the guidance does not include anything that will come from the review that we're going to undergo in the next couple of months. That is correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So, it basically assumes the benefits you've achieved through cost cutting are sort of stable, but don't improve materially until you can give us a more detailed update on where you think you can go?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. And then I noticed a couple other small things on page 36, 37, 38 of the release that you both modestly reduced capital expenditures \u2013 you came in slightly below your \u2013 the last guidance on CapEx for fiscal year 2016 and also modestly reduced the CapEx budget for the next few years. And at the same time, it also looks like the fixed and contracted revenues have improved somewhat substantially, mostly out in 2020. Looks like a cumulative improvement of about $200 million. Am I observing that correctly? And I know these are not massive changes, but cumulatively, they're significant. Can you walk us through what's improved?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean, let me just start with the capacity, and part of the change is just the result that we had from the New England capacity auction. So, keep in mind that what we have here on page 36, it really reflects the latest data points that we have on capacity prices and available capacity that we sell under that. And with respect to the other small IE, we can follow up with you, because I think it sounds like you have some specific questions about CapEx and small changes. So, we can follow up with you, Greg, after the call. But if you have something specific, we can certainly address it now.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","No. That's fine. I can ask. I'll follow up later. I wanted to ask Chris a question about Texas, because you did spend some time on it in the presentation. We are expecting, obviously, a new peak in demand this summer. How much incremental supply though are we expecting to come on from incremental wind capacity this summer as well? And is this sort of still the view that under normal weather conditions that we should, would see, all things equal, a significant reduction in renewables contributing to peak demand?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","So, if I got the CDR right from December of 2016, there's about 18,000 megawatts or so that was on when they published that in the early part of December. By the time we get to the summer of 2017, they're looking at about 20,000 total, give or take. The split is 18,000-ish in the non-coastal and 2,000 and just a little bit over on the coastal side of things. Interestingly, that puts the non-coastal areas at very, very close to the CREZ limit of around 18,000. So that looks relatively full from our perspective. But yeah, I mean, we've got a chart in here. I don't remember what page it is. It's early in the section. What number is that one?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","24.","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah, on page 24, where we've laid out some of the past peaks when we hit basically 71.1 last year. The forecast right now unadjusted is 72.9. And just to make it clear, what we could be staring at if August of 2011 comes back down around on the roulette wheel, we took the previous adder for high temperatures and tacked it on to their new one, you're pushing almost 76,000 megawatts, which would be an incredibly impressive kind of a number out there.","Having said that, you've got Wolf Hollow and Colorado Bend coming on this year, two very efficient new CCGTs, which should keep things down a little bit. And then the question that you end up with, which was the $1 million question last year was, which was how much does the wind blow. The expectation that they built into the CDR is 14% and 58%, depending on whether you're talking about non-coastal or coastal. We obviously got more than that last year on the non-coastal piece, and that remains to be seen.","I will say that, just one last thing, I will say that, I mean, we've seen them raise their load forecast by a couple thousand megawatts for the next couple years, which ate into the reserve margins, CDR over CDR kind of a thing, and that load growth is real. I mean that's part of the chart that we put there on page 24 as well.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. One final question, and this is a recent data point, so I don't know if you'll have an answer. But we've noticed that in the last week or two, that in some regions where you guys have power plants and some regions where you don't, that we're seeing a significant amount of coal-to-gas switching happening in real time with spot gas prices in the mid to high $2 range. And that's very different from the switching point we saw last time we were in a bear market for gas, when it was down in the low $2s. A, is that a correct observation? And B, is that just because Powder River Basin and rail costs are up or are there other factors?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","I mean, I don't think Powder River Basin coal has moved up all that much over the past time period. The last chart I saw, which was last week, had it ticking down ever so slightly. What I would say on that is you've got the Powder River Basin definitely down a little bit. But in terms of coal-to-gas switching, we haven't seen a huge change in those levels for us. What we have seen is cash gas awfully cheap, because it's going to be about 67 degrees here in Princeton today, and it's still at least by the calendar February. And so, cash gas is awfully cheap. So I think gas has come back on a little bit compared to what we saw in the earlier part of the winter where gas prices were much higher and coal was having stronger runs prior to this, call it, really mild weather.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","First, one clarification. The guidance for 2017, does that include the $400 million prior cost target or the $539 million updated number?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","It includes the full impact of the latter, the $539 million.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, the $539 million, like what, maybe just breaking, and you've kind of answered this and maybe I missed it, but on the slide, there's $71 million of plants that shut. How much is also related to the kind of like businesses that shut or exited and the like?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Beyond the savings associated with the divesture of plants, there's very little save a small amount of year-over-year change in terms of residential solar overhead. We streamlined that business and obviously changed the business model. But I'd say that number is less than $50 million in terms of overhead. The bulk of the difference, as you alluded to earlier, is just the changes associated with the plant sales, so Shelby, Seward, Rockford and Aurora.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, a question on just maybe a little clarification on the Business Review Committee, so I think per the agreement there, like an end date of August 15, is it fair to say you're targeting to complete that well before then?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, Steve, I think that's the goal. And over the next couple of weeks, we're going to meet as a Committee, start looking at every single one of our business with the benefit now of full information, including non-public information and the strategic plan that I laid out to the board last year. And I think that process, we're going to do it on an expedited basis. And one thing that it was important for me to highlight is, the areas where the Business Review Committee is going to focus is very well in line with the priorities that I laid out in 2016 and that we're continuing in 2017. So, now, we're going to have the benefit of working together with the same set of information, so we can make the best evaluation and make recommendations to the board and communicate that to investors later in the year. So, I think that an assumption that we're going to be communicating to the market before August is a fair assumption.","Now, keep in mind that, I want to make sure that as we communicate the decisions to our shareholders and to our investors, we need to make sure that we don't jeopardize the execution of any of those decisions. So, I will make that determination in the next \u2013 in the coming weeks and months. But we are on a fast track to make a full evaluation of every single one of our businesses.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Most of my questions were answered. But, Mauricio, let me ask, you guys have \u2013 and if your slide is correct on 7 \u2013 have a very competitive cost structure sort of to begin with, right. So, I'm kind of curious on what do activists seem like they're going to be able to extrapolate from this business? And maybe, is it more focused on asset sales and monetization versus further cost cut?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, two things. One, we understand that many of our investors were working with information from 2015 and partial information throughout the year. So, it is important that everybody recognizes the great efforts that we have gone through and the progress that we've made in terms of streamlining the organization and reducing costs. And this is the first step to improving our disclosures to all of you, so you can actually not only be able to benchmark us with our peers, but also hold us accountable on our efforts going forward. I mean, we may be competitive with other peers as we've put it in this additional disclosure. But certainly, that doesn't take us from our focus on continuing streamlining the organization. And irrespective of asset optimization or asset sales, this is part of who we are and this is part of the refocus of the company over the past 12 months.","Now, as you can appreciate, and I think I have mentioned already that, as we go through this process, we're certainly changing and recalibrating the makeup of our portfolio, and repositioning in a way that becomes more \u2013 that is better prepared to take advantage of the market opportunities as they will present themselves. So, I think it's going to be combination of two things. One is continue streamlining the organization; and then two, repositioning the portfolio that will have an impact on our total cost structure.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then just real lastly is, you did highlight some of the stuff in your prepared remarks as far as items impacting deregulated power markets. But one of the things that appeared to be missing was sort of some of the state initiatives that are looking to maintain viability of these money-losing nuclear plants, like whether you're looking at Illinois, New York, potentially Connecticut, and obviously potential moves in Pennsylvania. So, I'd be kind of curious on getting your viewpoint there and sort of where you guys sort of fit as additional states may look to come out with their own form of initiatives.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","No, that's a great point, and I'm glad that they didn't \u2013 it didn't get unnoticed on my remarks. I will tell you that we're completely focused. We're going to be active and we're going to be vocal in defending the integrity of competitive markets. We have done that already in New York and Illinois. And wherever we see that out-of-market payments for uneconomic generation to really subsidize and slow down the most efficient mix of generation and technologies that consumers need and want, we will be there. And like I said, I mean, today New York, Illinois, and wherever that pops, we're going to be a very vocal and active proponent of competitive markets.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There's no other questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Gutierrez for any closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, great. Thank you, and thank you for your interest in NRG and spending some time with us this morning, and look forward to talk to you in the next earnings call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

Please proceed.","Chad Plotkin","Thank you Grant and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you to NRG\u2019s full year and fourth quarter earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is being broadcast live, over the phone and via webcast which can be located on our website at www.nrgenergy.com. You can access the call, associated presentation material, as well as a replay of the call on the Investor Relations section of our website.

As always, joining me today and also presenting are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer. Additionally and available for questions, we\u2019re joined by our Head of Commercial Operations, Chris Moser; Elizabeth Killinger, who is Head of Texas Retail for us, and Jim Steffes, who is Head of Northeast Retail.","While as we sit here in sub-Arctic Princeton, New Jersey waiting for another 12 to 18 inches of snow on Sunday, it\u2019s an exciting time for us in the power business, which doesn\u2019t happen that often, so let\u2019s get right into talking our results. So if you\u2019re following with the presentation, beginning on Slide 3, I actually want to start with an apology to you, our shareholders. You may recall back in August during our second quarter earnings call, based largely on the relentlessly moderate summer weather across all of our core markets, we shifted downward our original 2013 financial guidance as we felt at the time that we did not have enough levers within management control to compensate for the weak summer and the time remaining in the year. That was a bitter pill for us to swallow because never before had we had to reduce guidance outside of the original range, so you may recall at the time I also vowed to you that NRG management would do everything within our control to try and get us back to our original guidance range.","Today, I\u2019m very pleased to report that with a very timely assist from early winter weather, we actually succeeded in getting back within our original range with $2.636 billion of adjusted EBITDA and an above-target outcome for free cash flow before growth of $1.282 billion. This performance was the result of an entire team effort across all functions, regions and businesses within NRG, and I want to thank all 8,500 of our employees for finishing strong, achieving this robust financial result, and for having done it with a top quartile safety record. As I said, I want to apologize to you, our shareholders, for having reduced guidance in the first place. I promise in the future to think twice before I underestimate what the amazing people at NRG can accomplish.","To continue on the execution front, as I know this is a question likely on the top of your minds, I want to acknowledge that our success in the fourth quarter of 2013 has in fact carried over into the start of 2014. Our plant operations and commercial operations folks have performed magnificently and in certain circumstances literally heroically to keep our plants fueled and operating during the extraordinary cold spells of January and beyond. Now you\u2019re probably sitting there asking yourself, how magnificently \u2013 can we put magnificently or heroic into financial guidance terms? And the answer to that question is that I\u2019m not going to do that, not today, and neither is Kirk or Mauricio. There are multiple reasons why I\u2019m not going to quantify our winter results \u2013 we\u2019re only 8 weeks into the year, it\u2019s still a summer-weighted business, the winter is not even over yet. Maybe most notably, we\u2019d have to re-guide anyway in a couple of months in order to take into account the Edison Mission acquisition. You can pick the reason you like the best \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you the one I like the best, which is that we have a lot of other good things to talk about here today, like the 17% increase in dividend at the NRG corporate level, and I\u2019d rather talk about that.","So with all the attention paid to NRG Yield over the eight months since it went public, we wanted to make sure to remind the market with this dividend increase being announced today that we also remain focused on ensuring that the shareholders of NRG parent also get a fair and regular return on their investment in NRG. ","Beyond the dividend increase, there are other highlights, there are creative and effective activities in the financial markets that Kirk can talk about. We have completed the GenOn integration on time so that our team can be ready for Edison Mission, and we have built out the capabilities of our retail team in the way we hoped to do when we talked about that at the beginning of 2013. I have a bit of reputation internally at NRG for being a bit hard to please, but I\u2019m very pleased with the overall performance of NRG in 2013 and through to where we stand in 2014.","So moving to Slide 4, there\u2019s much good news here on this slide as well, perhaps the best of which is my promise to you that this will be the last time you ever have to look at this slide. But it is important that I give you a final accounting of our internal scorecard for the GenOn integration so you can appreciate the financial results achieved as a result of all the hard work led by the NRG integration team and literally involving every single person at the company. Bottom line, we delivered $484 million of cash flow benefits, or over 60% higher than the original targets announced when the GenOn deal was announced; and what is not captured in the numbers is that in a number of important ways, we used the GenOn transaction as a springboard to strengthen the company\u2019s systems, our management depth, and the range of our expertise. ","Clearly all those capabilities are already being put to good use planning for the integration of Edison Mission Energy, and as the closing of that transaction fast approaches, you should note that every key work stream is proceeding smoothly and we expect very positive tangible and intangible results arising out of our combination with Edison Mission Energy. ","Turning to Slide 5, you will find the typical pie charts and bar charts illustrating the size and portfolio diversity of our fleet once the Edison Mission transaction closes a few weeks from now. I resurrect this slide here now because I think it\u2019s a good reminder of the business segment that underpins all of NRG\u2019s business initiatives in the short to medium term, and even into the longer term.","In the short term, by which I mean in this case the remainder of the winter and then the summer of 2014, I can tell you based on our experience over the past several weeks, never have I been more happy to have the type of generation fleet we have, the size of the fleet, the geographic distribution of the assets, the strength across the merit order, and most importantly the fuel diversity. And by fuel diversity, I\u2019m not just talking about the ability to fire a little bit of propane at some gas plants. I\u2019m talking about real fuel diversity \u2013 gas, coal, nuclear, and even oil. The fuel diversity of our fleet has been an immensely positive asset in the winter of 2013 \u2013 2014, but it\u2019s also not just the type of plants we own, it\u2019s the specific plants and the people who run them. Let it suffice to say at this point that I would not swap our fleet, megawatt for megawatt, or our operations team for anyone else\u2019s in the entire industry.","Longer term, you may be aware that much of what I say in public these days tends to center on where our industry is headed and what we at NRG believe is the inexorable trend towards a distribute generation-centric, disaggregated future featuring individual choice and the empowerment of the American energy consumer. That this future is going to occur is, in my opinion, inevitable; that it\u2019s going to occur faster than almost every person thinks it\u2019s going to occur is highly probable. But even if distribute generation is to be our destiny as a company, as an industry and as a society, that future is going to take a fair amount of time to be realized. So at NRG, we are positioning ourselves to succeed during a prolonged period during which the traditional centralized grid-based power system coexists with the fast emerging, high growth distributed sector, much like how fixed line long distance graciously gave way to cellular world dominance only after a couple of decades of relatively peaceful coexistence.","As American energy customers, business and individuals alike, turn away from the grid as their primary source of energy in ever increasing numbers, most will nonetheless stay dependent on grid power to varying degrees for years to come, either as supplemental power or as back-up, and as such our ability to serve those customers with our fleet of conventional generation with the power delivered over the traditional wires will remain the backbone of our business for some time to come, even in a world going distributed. ","So if you look at Slide 6, you will get a better sense of how we\u2019re going to organize ourselves for success in the current world as we prepare to win the future world. This organization will be done from the customers\u2019 perspective. Our conventional generation business will not only be focused on maintaining our existing fleet in top operating condition but also in repowering select plants with flexible fast start units designed to support the increasing market penetration of renewable. These plants will be located in advantageous positions on the grid and will be commercially justified off the strength of long-term offtake agreements.","Furthermore, in response to the increasing realization in the business community that no serious industry or commercial enterprise can prudently run their business based upon 100% dependence on the traditional grid, we see a growing business-to-business opportunity for our wholesale business in terms of onsite generation for industry and large-scale commercial customers. ","If we look at the central column on Slide 6, which is our mass or our main customer-facing business, we continue to believe that having a direct energy relationship with the American energy consumer is very valuable and increasingly part of our business strategy \u2013 indeed, a pivotal part of our strategy. Certainly within the confines of the existing centralized system, we have been extolling for years the virtues of matching generation in retail, and we continue to believe in those virtues; but with the pace of technological innovation aimed at the home energy consumer accelerating and the product offering getting so much better, as perhaps best exemplified by the Nest thermostat, having a positive preexisting relationship with the energy consumer is something we are working on very intently across the retail markets that we presently serve. We intend to continue to be the market leader in deploying energy innovation inside the home.","Finally on the right side of Slide 6, there is the post-centralized grid future driven by renewables, incorporating both energy storage and sophisticated localized automation to balance production and load in real time. We\u2019re just getting started in this area, but if you read our Necker Island announcement a couple weeks ago, you\u2019ll have a good sense of where we are going.","In short, it\u2019s an exciting time. We have a lot going on, but as we have demonstrated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and so far into 2014, is that all depends on us taking care of business day to day, and that is what we have done in those periods \u2013 again, a great fourth quarter of 2013 and a good start to 2014.","So with that, I will turn it over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you and good morning everyone. As David mentioned, we were able to recover from otherwise weak market conditions for most of 2013 to deliver another year of results within our original guidance. This was largely driven by excellent execution in the fourth quarter which has continued into the important winter months of 2014. ","Before I go into the results for the year, I want to take a moment to thank the men and women at NRG who in the bitter cold and snow that plagued the northeast did an exemplary job of keeping the grid stable and the lights on during the extreme cold weather conditions. Their dedication and professionalism makes us all proud to be part of this company.","On Slide 8, let me spend a few moments reviewing the goals I provided you last year for the operations group, where I\u2019m proud to say we delivered across the board. First and foremost, we delivered on our promise to employees and shareholders with best-in-class safety and operational performance across what is now the largest competitive generation portfolio in the country. We successfully integrated GenOn\u2019s 20 gigawatt generation portfolio into our operations, driving benefits from the additional (indiscernible) outside of Texas. Our relentless focus on cost and (indiscernible) synergies also paid off. We identified close to $120 million in operational synergies from the GenOn portfolio and leveraged that effort to achieve almost the same amount under our FORNRG program.","On the construction and development front, we finished an unusually busy year with the commissioning of the Ivanpah project in December. This brings the total number of new plants commissioned in 2013 to nine, an unprecedented number with a total generating capacity of 2400 megawatts. The program was on time and on budget, and I want to congratulate our (indiscernible) organization for this remarkable accomplishment.","Moving on to our operational metrics on Slide 9 and beginning with our most important metric, safety, even after nearly doubling the portfolio we achieved another year of top quartile performing with 82 out of 119 facilities with a single reportable injury. While our performance was not as strong as our record year in 2012, we continue to make improvements and adapt our safety program as we move out of controlled industrial sites and into (indiscernible) environment in our retail and service businesses. ","Our total generation was up 2% year-over-year driven primarily by higher coal generation across Texas and the northeast. This was partially by lower nuclear and gas generation given the weak summer conditions and lower (indiscernible) across the country. We continue to balance operational performance with margin at risk and overall spend throughout this low commodity price environment. While our coal and nuclear available was down year-over-year to 82%, our performance was remarkable during peak periods of high prices. Our gas portfolio maintained a strong performance with 98% starting reliability and our newest facilities, El Segundo and Marsh Landing, have performed exceptionally well since reaching commercial operations.","As we enter into the third year of the current FORNRG program, we have made significant progress leveraging the best practices learned from our operational synergies efforts around the general facilities. We achieved an outstanding result of $119 million for the year compared to a goal of $65 million, driven primarily by cost reductions in both plant operations and Texas retail. We are pleased with the strong results and expect to leverage the program as we integrate the Edison Mission portfolio.","Moving on to Slide 10, our retail business finished the year strong, delivering $614 million of EBITDA and exceeding our guidance as a result of the higher than expected volume in the fourth quarter. Heating degree days were significantly higher than last year while power prices remained moderate, expanding retail margins for the quarter. This outperformance was also the result of reduced cost per customer served.","Overall portfolio unit margins for the year were relatively stable with Texas able to hold margins around $23 per megawatt hour. These results were driven by continued effective marketing, selling and service execution as well as the introduction of innovative products which are driving a 5 to 20% improvement in retention rates. For the 12th consecutive quarter, we increased customer counts and at the same time our cost reduction efforts continued to produce strong results with full-year operations and maintenance expense per customer down 10% and SG&A per customer down 8%.","On the C&I front, competition remains fierce and we don\u2019t expect that to change any time soon. As we mentioned in the last call, to avoid just competing on price we\u2019re intensifying our efforts to provide advisory services and comprehensive solutions to our customers beyond system power, including backup generation, solar, and demand response. ","Turning to Slide 11, I\u2019d like to cover some of the macro trends we\u2019re seeing across our regions, but first let me spend a minute talking about how our portfolio has evolved over this past year. As you can see on the chart, back in 2012 our Gulf Coast generation business, which includes both Ercot and South Central, made up nearly 50% of our EBITDA. If you include our Texas retail franchise, this number was close to 80%. ","Now looking at 2013, not only our earnings have increased but they are far more diversified. The Gulf Coast business accounted for only 40%, achieving a nice balance with the east, and it\u2019s even further diversified when you consider that a significant portion of these earnings will come in the form of capacity payments. Also, with the success of NRG Yield and continued development of our alternative energy segment, the contracted portfolio made up over 10% of our net earnings. To put it simply, diversification across regions, merit order, fuel sources, and business lines are key as we have seen thus far in 2014, critical to our long-term financial performance.","Now on to the macro trends I mentioned before. Natural gas fundamentals continue to firm up. Demand has set a new record this winter and storage levels are expected to end the injection season at the lowest levels we have seen since 2013. What has been even more impressive is the reaction in the cash markets over the past several weeks with prices spiking in many northeast locations despite all the new gas production coming from the Marcellus shale. We experienced significant limitations in the gas delivery system and expect this type of regional price volatility to remain in the foreseeable future where a significant part of our portfolio is located.","In Ercot, the resource adequacy discussion has slowed down given the changes in load forecasting methodology and ongoing debate around adequate level of reliability and optimal reserve margins. We continue to see improvements in price formation with higher price cuts and the implementation of the operating reserve demand for this summer. I will cover in more detail our fundamental view, but we remain constructive that these changes will translate into actual scarcity pricing.","In the east and starting with New England, we\u2019re pleased with the capacity auction results largely extending from the retirement of non-economic generation. In New York, the addition of the Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone recognizes the location and value of our downstate generation, and finally in PJM improvements in price formation resulted in greater scarcity pricing this winter. We also see positive changes in the upcoming capacity auction where higher requirements will be placed on demand response and imports.","Finally in the west, current drought conditions have many concerned about the states\u2019 readiness to face the summer with only a fraction of its own hydro power resources available. In the medium term, the increasing reliance on renewable energy and the retirement of (indiscernible) cooling plants will provide a significant repowering opportunity for plants at premium locations.","Turning to Slide 12 and coming back to the Texas market, from our perspective while this debate has slowed down, we remain bullish on the overall market as very little has changed. We continue to see very strong fundamentals. As you see on the left side of the slide, demand continues to grow at a very healthy level, close to 2% a year. On the supply side, we see limited amounts of new capacity coming to the market given the high regulatory uncertainty and the low forward energy prices. In fact, there has been minimal scarcity price in the past two years, putting additional pressure on existing marginal resources. As a result of these market conditions, we do not plan to bring our Bertron units back from mothball status this summer. We remain bullish on our overall Ercot position but we need to be prudent about our investment of maintenance dollars in marginal assets.","We remain supportive of capacity markets as the most cost effective way of achieving the standard of reliability that Texas have enjoyed in the past. The (indiscernible) report released in January confirmed our position that the cost of achieving this standard, a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour increasing customer rates, is a well worthy investment of achieving this outcome. ","In the east, we have seen increasing signs of life. Demand has turned positive and changes in the market around price formation and retirement have provided a somewhat bullish energy outlook for the northeast. We have seen increasing frequency of high prices year-over-year in several markets where we have generation. Also when gas spikes to high double or even triple digits, the gas basis, power basis, (indiscernible) spreads and oil spreads go up while spark spreads crumble. If there is one lesson learned from the polar vortex, it\u2019s the value of fuel diversification, and our portfolio is perfectly positioned to take advantage of that.","Turning to our hedge disclosures on Slide 13, you will see that we increased our coal and nuclear hedges in 2015 from 34% to 56% as we took advantage of strong gas prices in December. We remain open beyond 2015 as we did not see any compelling opportunities to add additional hedges in the market. Many of you have requested additional information to our hedging disclosures and as you will see in our public filings, we have provided a breakout of our coal and nuclear hedges between the Gulf Coast and east regions, including our forward market prices, to assist you in evaluating our portfolio. We have also included our sensitivity chart that represents the value of the portfolio as we address one commodity at a time, keeping all other commodities constant. This (indiscernible) likely in the long run as gas prices and heat rates are often inversely correlated. ","The last point I will touch on is MISO integration. In late December, we successfully completed the MISO Day 1 integration, and for the first time our South Central assets and coal loads moving to an ISO2 settlement system. The move went fairly smooth and we are looking forward to working with our load partners in the new market.","As I have done now during the past three years as COO, I have laid out the priorities for the year on Slide 14. The focus is always to deliver safe and environmentally sound, best-in-class operations across our generation fleet, maximize the value of the assets, manage the supply risk of our retail portfolio, and deliver on our development by construction projects. This year, we will continue our integration efforts of not only executing on the operational synergies identified last year from the GenOn assets but we\u2019ll apply the lessons learned to the 7 gigawatts of generation coming from the Edison Mission. ","Finally and as David mentioned, we will leverage our leadership position on the district energy, CHB and back-up generation business to take a more aggressive role in the up and coming distributed generation opportunities that we see in the market.","With that, I will turn it to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirk Andrews","Thank you Mauricio and good morning everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 16, our 2013 financial results now place us proudly back in line with our original 2013 guidance. Specifically, adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.636 billion, exceeding the upper end of our most recent guidance range by $36 million, driven marginally by colder than expected weather during the last two months of the year, positively impacting both wholesale which ended 2013 with nearly $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and our retail businesses which delivered $614 million. Finally, NRG Yield finished 2013 with $244 million of adjusted EBITDA.","The favorable weather late in the year combined with operational improvements and lower capital expenditures drove free cash flow before growth to $1.282 billion in 2013, exceeding the upper end of our guidance range by $107 million and providing further liquidity improvements and a strong base for 2014 capital available for allocation. NRG\u2019s 2013 capital allocation plan again struck a successful balance among balance sheet management, value-enhancing investments, and return of shareholder capital. We continue our consistent focus on prudent balance sheet management by paying down over $900 million of debt, which included $575 million to redeem the 2014 GenOn senior notes and $200 million to repurchase NRG senior notes of various maturities. We reinvested in the growth of our company with over $800 million in acquisition and growth investments, enhancing our generation portfolio, further increasing our renewables platform, and expanding our retail businesses and customer offerings. Finally during the year, we returned $170 million through a combination of common stock dividends and share repurchases.","Now turning briefly to 2014 guidance on Slide 17, while exceptional operational performance combined with effective risk management helped to give NRG a strong start to this year, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for both 2014 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. This excludes the impact from the pending EME transaction and we will update our guidance on a combined basis following the closing, which we continue to expect by the end of the quarter. While our reaffirmed guidance demonstrates strong momentum in EBITDA growth, 2014 free cash flow guidance reflects our expectation that we will fund a majority of our current five-year environment capital expenditure forecast for NRG this year. ","Turning to liquidity on Slide 18, while we made significant strides last year in deploying capital to reduce indebtedness, invest in NRG\u2019s future, and return capital to our shareholders, we\u2019ve increased our cash balance, maintaining a solid level of core liquidity to satisfy the company\u2019s day-to-day working capital needs while providing a surplus to both fully fund the cash portion of the EME transaction and provide capital for further allocation in 2014. NRG\u2019s liquidity at year-end was approximately $3.7 billion, a $333 million increase since the prior year end due to a $218 million increase in cash and $115 million increase in credit facility availability.","Finally, as many of you have inquired regarding the cash balances and liquidity at GenOn, I\u2019ve included a table on this slide to provide some additional details on the portion of NRG\u2019s consolidated cash balances which reside at the GenOn level. GenOn ended 2013 with $760 million in cash of which, as you\u2019ll recall, we reserved $200 million for working capital purposes. This is the GenOn portion of our $940 million minimum cash balance across all of NRG. At year-end, $250 million of GenOn cash is distributable to NRG under the restricted payments basket provision in the GenOn bond indentures. This portion may be distributed to NRG or used for capital allocation at the GenOn level. The remaining $310 million in cash is also available for capital allocation at the GenOn entity level, a portion of which will be used in 2014 for the Avon Lake and Newcastle gas conversions we announced previously as a part of our operational improvements. Although not reflected in the consolidated NRG liquidity view, as of year-end there is also an additional $150 million available under the inter-company revolving credit facility, further enhancing GenOn\u2019s available liquidity.","Now turning to an update on NRG\u2019s dividend on Page 19, when we initiated NRG\u2019s first-ever dividend in 2012, supported initially by our growing contracted solar portfolio, we committed to both sustaining and growing this important component of our return of capital to shareholders, and I\u2019m pleased to announce our second consecutive year of double-digit dividend growth with a 17% increase in our annual dividend to $0.56 per common share, an increase of over 50% from our initial dividend of $0.36 per share in 2012. Our growing portfolio of contracted assets combined with our share of the increasing distributions from NRG Yield provides a strong base for NRG\u2019s commitment to dividend growth. This year\u2019s dividend increase also returns our dividend yield to 2%, delivering more than 15% of NRG\u2019s total standalone free cash flow before growth as a current return to our shareholders.","We\u2019re committed to continuing to grow NRG\u2019s dividend each year by a discretionary amount toward our goal of aligning our dividend with the distributions we receive from NRG Yield. As we continue to realize the benefits of NRG Yield\u2019s cost of capital and enhancing our opportunities to develop new contracted generation, and NRG Yield itself builds on its demonstrated ability to execute on third party acquisitions, our ultimate objective is to establish the NRG dividend as a direct pass-through of our distribution from NRG Yield, thereby allowing our dividend to reflect our broader strategic alignment with Yield.","Turning to 2014 capital allocation on Slide 20, NRG finished the year with over $2.2 billion in consolidated cash and cash equivalents. After subtracting our minimum cash balance, which also includes the $40 million in minimum cash at NRG Yield, and subtracting cash at various projects not currently distributable, we begin 2014 with nearly $1.2 billion in excess cash forming the base of our capital available for allocation. Adding our free cash flow before growth range to this balance gives NRG $2.139 billion to $2.339 billion in cash available for capital allocation this year.","During the year, scheduled debt amortization will further reduce NRG\u2019s consolidated debt by nearly $200 million. We\u2019ve reserved $800 million of capital to fund part of the cash needed for the EME acquisition. The balance of the cash portion of the EME purchase price will be funded by the proceeds we received from the NRG senior notes offering earlier this year and $800 million in cash acquired from EME as a part of the transaction. ","We begin 2014 with $330 million in previously allocated capital towards growth investments, which includes investments in operational improvements, conventional investments, and solar. $67 million in integration costs largely represents the balance of costs associated with the GenOn transaction, and finally we\u2019ve allocated $175 million toward our increased dividend in 2014. After these allocation items, NRG has $575 million to $775 million in remaining excess capital. We see growing opportunities for additional accretive investment in the current market environment, and NRG has ample surplus capital to take advantage of these opportunities. In addition, we expect to significantly increase this amount through proceeds to be received from drop-downs to NRG Yield during 2014, and we\u2019ve already begun discussions with NRG Yield on the first three of these, which we expect to announce in the next 60 days.","While we remain in line with our prudent balance sheet management target ratios, as we drop down assets, a portion of the project level distributions attributable to NRG Yield decreases the denominator in our corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio. Following each drop down, we will evaluate the impact on our target ratios and may allocate a portion of the proceeds toward debt reduction if needed.","Finally, having increased our dividend, we will revisit share repurchases as a means to augment our returned capital to shareholder, depending on investment opportunities, our exit capital balance and market condition as the year unfolds. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to David for his closing remarks.","David Crane","Thank you Kirk. As Mauricio did, the sort of overall goals and objectives for the company, which we always do on this call, appear on Slide 22. You can see our priorities for the 12 months ahead and this will allow you to follow along and hold us accountable for our progress. As you see from the list, we don\u2019t lack either ambition or in things to do, but I think one of the things I\u2019m proudest of is that we\u2019ve proven in the past that we can succeed at this company on multiple fronts simultaneously. ","So with that, Grant, I think we will open the phone lines for some questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Jon Cohen from ISI. Please go ahead.","Jon Cohen \u2013 ISI","Thanks, good morning guys. A couple questions \u2013 Mauricio, last year, you guys left yourself pretty open to the Texas summer and the weather really didn\u2019t show up, which caused the spark spreads to collapse early in the season, and you can see that on your Page 12, the delta between the \u201913 and \u201914 spark spreads. So just given that the outcomes are pretty primary and the experience you had last year, has that impacted your thinking about how you\u2019re going to hedge the Texas summer going into \u201914?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Hey Jon, good morning. As you can see on our hedge table, for 2014 around our (indiscernible) portfolio, we\u2019re pretty hedged. Where we have maintained the length has been around our gas portfolio and that, as you can appreciate for competitive reasons, we don\u2019t disclose particularly as we go into the summer. But what I will tell you is we are evaluating the open position that we have relative to last year. From a fundamental standpoint, it was tighter last year. We\u2019re seeing some plants coming online this year, and we\u2019re taking that into consideration.","Now keep in mind that we also have some positive developments. One is the increasing price (audio interference) to 7000 and then the second one is the implementation of ORDC, which would improve potential scarcity pricing. So you know, we\u2019re balancing both the fundamental view that we have and some of the market changes, so of course it always influences our view but I would say\u2014you know, that\u2019s what I would give you in terms of color on how we\u2019re approaching (indiscernible).","Jon Cohen \u2013 ISI","Okay, thanks. I think I missed about 50% of what you said. I don\u2019t know if it was just me or everybody, but I\u2019m sure it was good so I\u2019ll go back and read the transcript. Then another question for Kirk \u2013 there\u2019s been a lot of chatter among the fixed income community recently about certain coverage thresholds being breached at one of the GenOn subs and speculation as to how that\u2019s going to impact the rest of the GenOn structure. Appreciating that there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainties and that your first maturity is sometime away, can you talk generally about what the issue is and whether you\u2019re concerned about it, and maybe a few of the options that you have available to deal with it?","Kirk Andrews","Sure, Jon. Well first of all, as you\u2019ll read later as we file our 10-K, there are a number of distribution tests within the GenOn (indiscernible), most notably there are three. There\u2019s one at GenOn which is exactly what you\u2019re used to seeing in our unsecured notes, which is the distribution test at 5.75 times corporate debt to corporate EBITDA, and then both GenOn and REMA have fixed charge coverage ratios. GenOn\u2019s ratio is a trailing ratio. We were kind of right on top of that, slightly over it as of the end of the year. GENMA and REMA are slightly below their fixed charge coverage ratio test, and importantly those tests are both backward looking on a 12-month basis and forward looking. So currently, the cash that I went through on the liquidity slide is subjected to those various tests, but given that we reserve a certain amount of cash for liquidity needs within the complex and there is an ample amount of cash within that, we\u2019re comfortable in the current environment; and while certainly one could prognosticate about what the future impact might hold in terms of where the commodity price environment is, et cetera, from my perspective you look no further than the unusual events especially that occurred in the northeast, where a lot of those plants are located, and how some of the upside can change the fortunes especially from a cash and liquidity standpoint.","So currently we\u2019re quite comfortable with the liquidity levels across the complex, and there are various means at our disposal to manage around that, most notably as I indicated in my remarks, we\u2019ve got that inter-company credit facility between NRG and GenOn to help support the liquidity needs moving forward. But as I said, there is ample liquidity currently there today.","Jon Cohen \u2013 ISI","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.","David Crane","Thanks Jon. Is there another question? Well, I don\u2019t know if people on the phone are having communications issues, but we\u2019re not hearing anything here.","Jon Cohen \u2013 ISI","I can just keep asking questions if you want.","David Crane","Yeah! Well Jon, that sort of depends on whether they\u2019re easy questions, but why don\u2019t you go ahead.","Jon Cohen \u2013 ISI","Why is NRG such a good company?","David Crane","Because it\u2019s followed by such great sell-side analysts! Okay, go ahead, Jon.","Jon Cohen \u2013 ISI","","No, I mean I guess one other question is just as you talk about your distributed generation strategy, do you see the potential for maybe some distributed generation assets being dropped into NYLD? Could that be a financing vehicle going forward for\u2014so maybe some longer term retail PTAs?","David Crane","You know, it\u2019s interesting, and I guess I should answer that question\u2014well, I guess I can answer that question from NRG\u2019s perspective. We would hope and we believe that the management of NRG Yield has discussed with the NRG Yield board of directors, their independent directors, the idea that ultimately down the road \u2013 and this is a few years down the road \u2013 that whether it\u2019s C&I level customers or even ultimately residential customers, that they\u2019re going to have to be looking at leases or offtake agreements that aren\u2019t just with sort of the traditional utilities but these sort of credit bundles, if you will. So we do think that that ultimately\u2014you know, from NRG\u2019s perspective we would hope that NRG Yield would be able to wrap their mind around the offtake credit is going to become a little bit more varied than just utility offtakes. But I think from NRG Yield\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s at least two to three years away before they\u2019re going to have to confront that, because I think it would take two to three years for us at NRG to be able to sort of bundle appropriate packages to deliver to them for consideration.","Thank you, Jon, for that entertainment moment, because I think that we can go back to the queue. Grant?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. ","David Crane","Stephen, everything we possibly could do to block you out did not work, so now it\u2019s your chance to ask a question.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, you delayed as long as you could, but we still have about 15 minutes. So yeah, I wanted to just get your sense of as you look at acquisition opportunities, both for renewable assets, contracted fossil assets, can you just give a little color on the extent to which you do see opportunities? Clearly the NYLD currency must be helpful, but I\u2019m just curious, as you seeing willing sellers, are you seeing a fairly large amount of opportunities, or are there issues in terms of whether there\u2019s\u2014you know, the delayed transaction? Just some color on sort of the M&A market, if you could.","David Crane","Well the M&A market\u2014the question was specifically the M&A market for contracted assets, is that right?","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s right. ","David Crane","Yeah. So what I would tell you, Stephen, is that I think it is sort of a\u2014it\u2019s a target rich environment, and right now while there are a lot of other people that are, as you know, talking about yield vehicles, there aren\u2019t that many others out there that actually exist, and the ones that are, are much smaller and sort of single asset or single type of asset, so we like to think not at the same quality as NRG Yield. So there are a lot of targets.","What I would tell you is that the two challenges that have to be overcome is, number one, the success of NRG Yield and what it means about NRG Yield\u2019s cost of capital. The math can easily be done by the seller, and so my bigger concern rather than having a bunch of targets is making sure that the seller doesn\u2019t think that all the benefit of NRG Yield\u2019s cost of capital goes to them, because for it to work, we have to have some clearance on our cost of capital. So I think it\u2019s raised price expectations amongst sellers of contracted assets.","The second thing, and this is an interesting area, it\u2019s just more complicated, is that particularly when you talk about renewable contracted assets, there are a lot of thinly capitalized companies that have a portfolio of operating assets but they also have a development portfolio, and what\u2019s interesting to me and interesting to them, but complicated, is the idea of working out an arrangement going forward where they can feed their contracted assets into NRG Yield but also have some sort of understanding with respect to their development assets when they get them finished. That could very much be a win-win, but it\u2019s complicated.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s great color. David, I wanted to talk kind of about the future of distributed generation. You\u2019ve written some interesting things and I think recently gave a discussion of this. One of the elements I wanted to talk about was the Stirling engine coupled with batteries. If you could just give us a sense for how that business plan is developing, what we should be looking for, how you see that potentially rolling out over time.","David Crane","Well I mean, I\u2019m always very concerned about the precise nature of the question, Stephen. I mean, the Stirling engine, it has a few batteries in it but the beauty of the Stirling engine, which for other people on the call, we hope it to be our entrance into the distributed generation in terms of reliable distributed or non-intermittent distributed generation, is that while it does have a few batteries in it to sort of clean up the power from a voltage perspective, for us it\u2019s a substitute for massive banks of batteries. The basic theory of it is that if you have a machine that ties to the natural gas system in the United States, you can link it up with solar on a distributed basis and you don\u2019t need to have a basement full of batteries. ","So what we\u2019re trying to get to on Stirling, we\u2019re in the field demonstration phase, Stephen. We expect to have 20 machines out in real-life applications by the end of the first half of this year, and that will lead to a decision to go to large-scale manufacturing in the second half of the year, and hopefully available for\u2014you know, fully commercially available certainly by the second half of 2015. So I think you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more about that over the next six to 12 months.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks so much. I\u2019ll let others have some time. ","David Crane","Did that answer your question?","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That answers it. Thank you very much.","David Crane","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from UBS. Please proceed.","Paul Zimbardo \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning. I had a question about your expansion plans in California \u2013 I think you\u2019ve called them significant repowering opportunities, what you\u2019re seeing out there, and also your contracting efforts in New York.","David Crane","Well, in general terms I think our main goal in California is in the wake of the San Onofre closure to move forward with our project at Carlsbad, which I think it\u2019s well on track; it\u2019s just that things go\u2014it takes a while in California. I\u2019m actually\u2014in addition to people I\u2019ve previously said, John Chillemi, who runs California for us is here. John, do you have anything to add to that?","John Chillemi","I do. There is also an RFO ongoing right now with Southern California Edison, and two of our sites that have great repowering opportunities are participating in that. One is the El Segundo energy center second phase, which is 435 megawatts proposed, and the other is what we call the Mandalay repower in Oxnard, where there\u2019s a station there that we\u2019re looking to replace with 300 megawatts. So we are participating in the current SE RFO, and we\u2019re also pursuing the Carlsbad energy center.","David Crane","Okay, thanks John. And you mentioned New York \u2013 I think it was announced recently about a refueling of Dunkirk in western New York to gas, which I think is very helpful. We have a permitted site in New York City at Astoria which we\u2019d love to go forward. We\u2019re just hoping basically for a long-term contract. So as I\u2019ve said previously, I hope just in terms of intrinsic growth that over the next 12 to 18 months, we certainly can go forward with 1,000 to 2,000 megawatts in total of redevelopments of existing sites off the strength of long-term contracts so that they would be assets that over time would be \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is proper English \u2013 drop down-able into NRG Yield.","Paul Zimbardo \u2013 UBS","Okay, great. A follow-up question \u2013 on Slide 6, it\u2019s really great, a lot of information there. On the bottom, if you kind of had to place your bets, if you will, where do you see the biggest growth opportunities for (indiscernible)? I know you touched on energy storage a little bit already.","David Crane","Well, I think if you\u2019re talking about growth opportunities in terms of financial growth in the near term, the type of term that most people on the phone are probably interested in, sort of the two to five-year term, by far I think that the greatest growth effort for us would be actually in the center column where traditional retail and residential solar come together. We are big believers in this view that various analysts, maybe some analysts on the phone, have also come to the conclusion that within the next 12 to 24 months in 24 states, roughly 20 to 24 states, residential solar will be cost competitive, and where we see our advantage is in combining that with actually supply of system power. So I would say in the medium term time frame, that is the highest growth area.","Paul Zimbardo \u2013 UBS","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Awesome, thank you. So I wanted to start with the year-to-date results. I know you don\u2019t want to quantify any benefit, but you kept talking mostly about your generation assets. How did the retail perform year-to-date?","David Crane","So Angie, first of all, I should say the first draft of our comments, Chad wanted me to say about how we wouldn\u2019t talk about year-to-date. He almost had a sentence in there saying, Angie won\u2019t listen to our statement that we won\u2019t talk about it. ","So what I would say, we have Elizabeth and Jim here, but I would say that the cold weather that we have\u2014I mean, there have been bouts of cold weather. It\u2019s been coldish weather in Texas, but nothing of course like what we\u2019ve seen in the northeast. But we\u2019ve had good volume in Texas and so\u2014and that by far is the biggest portion of our retail, so I\u2019d say that they\u2019re sort of on a positive track.","With respect to the northeast and the extraordinary weather that we\u2019ve got up here, as we\u2019ve talked about, the various extreme weather events in the summer or the winter, we hedge our retail book against expected weather so when extraordinary weather comes there is a road bump, so I would say that the results in the northeast retail year-to-date were not positive. But the scale of it relative to the positive side on the wholesale, it\u2019s sort of a rounding error.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, that\u2019s great. Moving on to the South Central business, there was a pretty significant drop year-over-year in the profitability of this business. The area has just joined MISO. How should we think about it going forward? Is this actually\u2014is the MISO joining, does it actually create potential upside to your earnings power from the plants there, or is it given that there\u2019s going to be more availability of power in the region, that\u2019s actually going to suppress earnings further?","David Crane","It\u2019s a good question, Angie, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a tough question. I\u2019m going to ask Mauricio to answer it.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Hey, good morning Angie. So look, year-over-year South Central was affected by lower spark spreads, and I don\u2019t think you can\u2014as we go into MISO, and that integration just happened at the end of the year, we\u2019re still waiting to see how that market will develop and some of the initial pricing has been somewhat positive. But just looking at 2013, you saw in our compression of spark spreads, we didn\u2019t have sustained weather so that affected the profitability of the business. That\u2019s pretty much it.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, and my last question is you\u2019re talking about asset drop-downs to NRG Yield, and there\u2019s clearly a big gap in the value, which is implied in the NRG share price from the market value of NRG Yield. How should we think about your ability to bridge this gap? Is it that every time there\u2019s a drop down of assets into NRG Yield, you\u2019re basically going to use the cash to buy back shares of NRG, or\u2014and that\u2019s how you\u2019re actually going to link the valuations of these two stocks?","Kirk Andrews","Angie, it\u2019s Kirk. First of all, in terms of the value linkage, the only thing I would say is prescriptively in terms of our long term goals is my remarks about the dividend. In terms of the specific proceeds from NRG Yield drop-downs, we look at that as just capital replenishment, and we would deploy that capital towards the opportunities as we see them across the three categories as we typically describe them. I made a couple of remarks about the impact on drop-downs on our credit ratios, which of course we take that into consideration as to what, if any, portion of those proceeds would go towards maintaining those target ratios, and then we approach the remaining capital, which would be the substantial portion of that from any drop-down as we would any capital allocation decision between NRG and NRG Yield. ","But certainly we\u2019re mindful of the fact that the cash proceeds are easier for the market to grasp in value than is our stake in NRG Yield, but our focus is certainly in driving the success of that moving forward in part to help resonate the fact that NRG Yield as we expected to do, most notably because of some of the opportunities that John Chillemi mentioned. That is really an enabling factor to allow us to drive our success and be more competitive in realizing the benefits of the opportunities that present to us in our markets for redevelopment, which is largely going to be on a contracted basis.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, but just going back to the original statement you made about watching your credit metrics, there is so much debt that is moving with these assets, like if these are highly levered solar assets, a lot of them actually, so the drop-downs into the NRG Yield should significantly de-lever your balance sheet, so why would credit metrics worry you at NRG?","Kirk Andrews","Sure. On a consolidated basis, that\u2019s true; however, in terms of our credit ratios, especially under our indentures there\u2019s a very important corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratios, the debt which is all non-recourse at those excluded project subsidiaries that make up all of the assets, both in NRG Yield as well as the assets in ROFO pipeline, that doesn\u2019t count towards that particular ratio, i.e. the numerator of that ratio. However, as I indicated in my remarks, the one thing we do benefit from in those excluded project subs in terms of the denominator, that is the corporate EBITDA, is the distributions that we get from those subsidiaries. So when we move an asset into NRG Yield, it does not affect our corporate debt, i.e. the numerator; it does reduce the corporate EBITDA by the amount of those distributions, the denominator.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie","Okay.","David Crane","Thank you, Angie. And Grant, I know we\u2019re approaching if not passed the top of the house, and some of the people on the call will have another earnings call with NRG Yield in half an hour, and I know the management of that company gets really antagonized when we go over. But since we did have that disruption, I\u2019d like to take two more calls and then anyone that we don\u2019t get to, we apologize and please contact Chad and we\u2019ll set up a call or try and answer your questions.","So Grant, two more callers and then we\u2019ll be done.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Any thoughts on the demand revisions here from Ercot: And then the preliminary CDR has come out. Any early thoughts on their views of reserve margins? ","David Crane","Well, let me just say I\u2019m sure Mauricio will have more to add to this. I think we\u2019ve shown here, didn\u2019t we, that\u2014I mean, Texas was up 3.4% for the quarter, so why someone thinks Texas is going to suddenly stop\u2014go down to 1, I mean, you tell me. We would be planning for more robust growth.","Mauricio Gutierrez","No, I think\u2014Neil, our view is that we\u2019ve seen over the past three years low growth, weather-normalized close to 2%. We have seen the revised new load forecasting methodology coming out of Ercot, and I think it has it around 1.3%. We disagree with that assessment. I have not seen the new CDR since I\u2019ve been sitting I\u2019ve been sitting here, but what I would tell you is we\u2019re going to look at some of the other assumptions that they have embedded in their 1.3% load forecast and the variables on the CDR, particularly around energy efficiency to make sure that there is no double counting. You know, we\u2019ll go through that in the next couple of hours, but what I will tell you is we continue to see very robust demand not only Ercot as a whole but speaking with Elizabeth and her team at retail. We don\u2019t see the economy as slowing at all.","David Crane","Yeah, I\u2019d actually like Elizabeth to comment on that because a big part\u2014you know, an important sales channel for Reliant is actually people moving in, and as far as I know, I\u2019ve heard of no abatement in terms of pace of people moving into Texas. And if we get 18 inches on Sunday, hell, I\u2019m moving to Texas!","Elizabeth Killinger","And you\u2019d be welcome. No, I would agree with what Mauricio said. The economy is very healthy in Texas. It was the last to go into the recession, the first to rebound, and we have new businesses coming in Houston, to the greater Houston area, and Dallas sees some of the same. From a retail perspective, our engine is strong across all of our retail brands in Texas and momentum is strong, and I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019re going to do this year.","David Crane","Yeah, so we don\u2019t believe it. Did you have another question?","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah, on the PTM auctions here, can you talk about pluses and minuses as you think about it as the auctions are coming up, both for RTO and then also for the eastern footprint?","Mauricio Gutierrez","","Okay, Neil, I\u2019ll pass it on to Chris Moser.","Chris Moser","Hey Neil, it\u2019s Chris. On the BRA coming up in May, I think one of the big pieces that we\u2019re going to see is the limits on imports \u2013 I know they\u2019re about 7,500 megawatts that cleared in the \u201916 - \u201917. For the \u201917 \u2013 \u201918, that looks like it\u2019s going to be capped at about 6,500. You\u2019ve also got the cap on DR, the limited DR, which has been 90%-some of the DR that tends to get purchased, so that\u2019s going to be capped at around 2%, so call that 2,500 versus the 10,000 or so that cleared last time. So those are two of the big ones. I know they\u2019re still working on DR operability and a couple of other moving pieces, so those are kind of the pluses we see for the BRA.","In terms of the incremental that is closing later today, it\u2019s going to be interesting. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen PJM on the buy side \u2013 normally, they are reducing load forecasts and have extra megawatts available that they\u2019ve got to spit out into the third incremental. This is the first time that PJM is actually on the buy side and will be procuring some, so that\u2019s a swing of 1,000 or 1,500 megawatts there, and it will be very interesting to see where this one clears. I believe the numbers come out next Friday.","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you guys.","David Crane","Thank you. So Grant, last question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi, good morning. I might have missed some of this in the in and out of the call, but just curious to your interest in\u2014there\u2019s a lot of distressed people both in conventional generation as well as more recently in retail. It seems like there\u2019s a lot of retail businesses for sale. Could you give us at least some view of your interest in acquiring more of both?","David Crane","Yeah, what I would say about that is that\u2014I mean, both in terms of conventional, wholesale and retail system power, they are both core parts of our businesses, particularly in the geographic areas we\u2019re in. We look at everything, so we look at everything and we get specific on nothing on a call like this. But no \u2013 we definitely actively look at everything, and I don\u2019t know if I would say\u2014you sort of said distressed, but I mean, we were a little bit surprised that we didn\u2019t actually get more questions about buybacks, why aren\u2019t you announcing buybacks. But Kirk said it near the very end of his comments, which it is a good time, I think, to be a buyer and so\u2014because it does seem like there\u2019s a lot of potential opportunities out there, and at a particular price we\u2019re interested in a lot of things.","I would say on the generation side, the times where we used to say to you, look, we really need a counterweight for our position in Texas and we\u2019ve got this northeast but we need more in PJM, that was the one compelling strategic need we had on the generation side, and let\u2019s face it \u2013 that was satisfied by the GenOn transaction. So I think it\u2019s a more opportunistic approach on the wholesale side.","On the retail side, clearly we have a fantastic market leading position in Texas. It could always be better. We\u2019re interested in more retail in the northeast, but in the northeast it\u2019s sort of market to market, and some markets are good, some are less good. So we look at everything and we\u2019ll see what happens over the next six months.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Great. Thank you very much.","David Crane","Okay, thank you Steven, and thank you all for hanging in there with us through whatever troubles there were with the phone and for an hour and 10 minutes, and we\u2019ll try and be more succinct next time. So Grant, I think that\u2019s it.","Operator","Okay, thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This now concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. ","I would now like to disperse this conference call. Mr. Chad Plotkin, you may begin.","Chad Plotkin","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone, and welcome to NRG's full year and fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. Because this call will be limited to one hour, we ask that you limit yourself to only one question with one follow-up. As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective.","Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in today's presentation as well as the risk factors contained in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law.","During this morning's call, we refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures of the company's operating and financial results. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and this presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn over the call to David Crane, NRG\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer.","David Crane","Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Chad. Even before I go through the familiar ritual of introducing my colleagues, I want to draw your attention to the latter part of today\u2019s earnings release, where we announced that Chad Plotkin is stepping down from being Head of Investor Relations from both NRG and NRG Yield in order to take up a position as Head of Finance for NRG Home Solar.","Chad came to the IR position three years ago as a rising star in our strategy and M&A group at a time when we decided that our company and our investors were best served by an IR Head who had been deeply and directly involved in the business of the company. And in two years, Chad has worked tirelessly to explain the complexities of NRG to our current and hopefully future investors, but Chad has been more than that during his tenure, he has been a trusted advisor to Kirk, Mauricio, myself, and the rest of the Executive Leadership team. ","As he moves through a clerically important finance position in Home Solar, our loss becomes Kelcy Pegler and Steve McBee\u2019s gain. For our part, we wish him well in this new position and for your part as investors in the NRG group of companies; I think you should expect doing counter him again. Chad\u2019s successor Matt Orendorff who liked Chad before him rises out of our strategy and M&A group is similarly a rising star deeply immersed in and familiar with the key initiatives of the company. But I will wait to see other good things about him until he proves himself in his new position.","As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Additionally in making his first appearance on earnings call, I am pleased to have Steve McBee, President of NRG Home with us as well. Additionally and available for questions are Chris Moser, Head of Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., Head of NRG Home Solar.","Before I begin I first want to thank everyone for participating in our investor event just six weeks ago. And since our strategy hasn\u2019t changed appreciably in the intervening weeks and since there have been no strategy altering intervening event since then, I will keep my prepared remarks as brief as possible. So let\u2019s get to it.","Turning to slide 3, as we\u2019ve discussed over the past few quarters, our core power markets experienced quite a roller coaster ride in 2014 with a particularly severe winter and an extraordinarily mild summer. I am pleased to report today that due to faultless execution across our core wholesale and retail platforms, we successfully delivered on our fiscal year 2014 financial guidance as revised our last year\u2019s third quarter call. ","Further and as we indicated at our Investor Day, even in the phase of continued softening of our core commodity prices, we again are reaffirming our 2015 financial guidance with its prospect of the year-over-year growth from 2014. There has been concern about softening commodity prices in the early days of this year, but our excellent operational execution over the past few months combined with the benefits of our diversification away from 100% reliance on conventional wholesale generation makes this possible for NRG, makes reaffirming guidance possible in a way that is not always possible for our pure play IPP peer group.","Building on that theme and turning to slide 4, our strategic actions in 2014 continue to lay the foundation for NRG as we build the future of our company in response to transition that we now believe to be clearly underway in our industry, by the way I am still on slide 3. Following the strategic blueprint provided to us by the winners in the telecom revolution, we have been a big and successful consolidator in the conventional power sector while pushing forward into key phases of the new more, distributed more sustainable and carbon-constrained world of personal power. ","We deliver on all of our integration targets for our two most significant 2014 acquisitions and did so more quickly than we originally thought possible. We enhanced NRG Yield and we began to process through NRG carbon 360 of providing a long-term future for our younger coal plants even in a de-carbonizing world.","Now, you should turn to slide 4. Furthermore, we have been on a strategic path at least since 2010 to diversify our financial performance away from pure commodity risk. Back in 2007 or 2008 if you would ask me to explain in the most simple terms what NRG did to make money, I would have told you that we sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices. And while I still believe that for the most part in most markets, it\u2019s preferable to sell coal and uranium at natural gas prices than it is say to sell natural gas at natural gas prices, NRG has in the ensuing five years become so much more in just a natural gas commodity play.","As illustrated on slide 4, we have grown our economic gross margin by 70% over those five years all in a relentlessly subdued natural gas price environment while reducing the contribution of natural gas exposed margin by roughly 30%. This is a trend both in terms of growing gross margin and reducing natural gas price correlation that we are working hard to perpetuate. So in a market like we have seen over the past few months, where natural gas has again declined to under $3 per million BTU, we remind you that NRG is not just a natural gas story but it\u2019s increasingly an investment in the clean energy future which means among other attributes that we are built to weather volatility in gas prices while preserving the upside in the power markets when they materialize.","Moving to slide 5, because I\u2019ve referenced our Investor Day and recognize that not all of you were able to join us in Houston, let me close by reiterating what we took 7 hours to tell you down there into 70 seconds. Here is my pitch and hopefully this becomes your NRG investment thesis.","Our industry is in the early, but unmistakable stage of a technology driven disruption of historic proportion. This disruption ultimately is going to end in a radically transformed energy industry where the winners are going to be that those who offer their customers whether they be commercial, industrial or individual customers, a seamless energy solution that is safer cleaner and more reliable, more convenient, and increasingly wireless. And I might add just generally more personally and what is currently being offered to energy consumers through our current commanding control centralized one size fits all, wire and wooden pole system invented by Thomas Edison and seemingly last improved upon in his era.","NRG through our multiple initiatives in the Smart Home with Home Solar distributed generation reliability solutions micro grids, electric vehicle charging in portable solar and energy storage products is positioning itself to win this long term future in a way that no other power company is attempting. In the short-to-medium term, we continue to execute across our consolidated and unrivaled asset platform in a manner that will allow us to win the next few years as the power plants of the Post World War II era create a retirement tsunami washing across our core markets that will benefit us as one of the last man standing. Thanks to our substantial investment in environmental remediation over the past 10 years. ","With that I will turn it over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. The extreme market conditions that prevailed in 2014 highlighted some of the strength of our integrated platform. Our diverse fleet in the Northeast benefited from the severe cold weather earlier in the year and our integrated wholesale retail platform combined with our commercial and operational performance help mitigate the impact of a very mild summer and allowed us to deliver our 2014 financial results.","Perhaps more relevant to you today is the fact that we aggressively hedged the portfolio for 2015 during the fourth quarter allowing us to reaffirm guidance. While it is still early in the year, I am pleased to say that we are off to a good start with a solid performance during the most recent quarter.","Slide 7 returns to goals that I provided to you last year and as you can see with the levered across the board on our safety operational and commercial metrics. We successfully integrated Edison Mission\u2019s","8 gigawatt portfolio delivered on operational synergies and announced a comprehensive asset optimization plan for the mid-west fleet at attractive economics.","On our distributor generation efforts, we successfully integrated the Omaha District Energy System and were awarded a contract for 178 megawatt for preferred resources in California. We now have a full suite of distributive solutions for businesses. These combined with our commercial wholesale platform and access to low cost capital through Energy Yield, positions the growth for a significant growth in 2015. You will hear more about these efforts in the months to come.","The critical part of our strategy is the repositioning of our portfolio to out survive the current way of retirements and benefits from changes in capacity markets and repowering opportunities. Slide 8 provides a summary of our comprehensive asset optimization and development plan. We current have close to 12,000 megawatts of generation targeted for fuel conversions, environmental retrofits or repowering opportunities.","These initiatives are consistent with our goals of streamlining cost, maintaining or expanding field diversity, reducing the environmental foot print of our portfolio and extending the economic life of asset. The projects are progressing as planned, but some of them are driven primarily by capacity revenues. The outcome of the upcoming capacity performance auction in PJM could change our plans going forward.","Turning to our operational metrics on slide 9 and beginning with our most important metrics, safety. I want to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues for another great year of safety performance finishing in the top quartile. We have 128 out of 161 facilities without a reportable injury. This is an outstanding result considering the significant winter conditions in the east and the Edison Mission integration efforts beginning in April. It was the second best performance in the last eight years at a rate of 0.73. While our fleet continues to grow in size and diversity the one constant continues to be our strong safety performance. I want to recognize our distributor group for a perfect safety record with fewer recordable injuries. Well done.","Our overall generation was up 4% year-over-year on a normalized basis despite the lack of summer demand. The increase was driven primarily by higher generation in the west, the record production year at STP Unit 2 and the higher runs experienced during the polar vortex in the east. This highlights the importance of our well diversified portfolio. We continue to balance operational performance with marginal risk and overall spend throughout this low commodity price environment.","Our coal and nuclear availability was down year-over-year to 82%. However, the fleet showed strong performance during peak pricing periods. This is evident in the improved year-over-year coal and nuclear reliability performance. In the third and final year of the current fornrg program we leveraged best practices from the operational synergies efforts in the general facilities and expanded that for the rest of the organization.","We achieved an outstanding result of $198 million for the year, compared to a goal of $100 million. This success was driven primarily by improvement delivered by plant operations and Texas retail. Thank you to you all, of our colleagues who provide the commitment and execution behind our continuous improvement culture. We are confident we can continue to deliver the same value to our shareholders in the next iteration of the fornrg Program.","Moving to our market update on slide 10, I want to start with natural gas, given the recent decline in prices. As David mentioned, we have been very successful in diversifying our margins away from natural gas, but it continues to be an important driver, so let me share a few thoughts. In the start of the Shale gas revolution six years ago the industry has focused almost exclusively on the amount of supply flooding the market.","While impressive by any standards there has been very few catalysts on the demand side until now. Over the next few years gas demand will likely see a swift change coming primarily from four sources, the power industry, LNG, Exports to Mexico, and industrial demand. This incremental demand would commence earlier this year with additional coal to gas switching and the implementation of more stringent environmental regulations that will drive coal and oil retirement.","Our current head position allows us to weather this low commodity cycle and be ready for a more favorable market environment. Turning to the east markets, the IFOs are redefining the capacity products and requiring generators to perform during shortage conditions. The changes will allow for higher compensation, but will also hold them for higher penalties for non-performance.","As a generator with a large diverse portfolio, strong operational track record, and fuel onsite we support and welcome these improvements. The result from the recent New England capacity auction for 1819 were quite encouraging with prices increased significantly year-over-year. PJM still awaiting resolution from FERC on each proposal, which is expected to happen sometime in early April. We are excited about our prospects for our portfolio with 17 gigawatts of generation in the region, not only for the many option, but also for the transition auctions for the year that have already cleared.","The recent coal front in the northeast once again proved the value of our diversified portfolio where unlike gas generation our coal and oil assets benefited from spikes in gas and power prices. Our strategies extent the life of our assets and maintain a cheap option on energies that can benefit from short-term dislocations in the market like the once we experienced in the past two winters. ","Now moving onto Texas on slide 11, demand grew by 2.4% on a weather normalized basis in 2014, driven primarily by the residential and commercial sectors. While low oil prices will undoubtedly have an impact on the Texas economy. This will be somewhat muted by the diversification that Texas has been able to achieve in recent years. A lot has been said about the robust demand in Texas and the need to build new generation, but given the implementation of new environmental programs like maps, CSAPR, and EPAs proposed regional hedgerow [ph] for Texas it is important to talk about the potential impact to the supply stock. Make no mistake, we expect coal to be impacted by these regulations. But as you can see in the table, our portfolio is well positioned to comply with these rules and not only out survive the competition but benefit from the retirement of our units.","That leaves me to the forward market where prices seem to reflect very little risk premium for the next few summers as you can see on the upper right hand chart. For the past three years, we have experienced no scarcity pricing despite having single digit operational reserve margins every year. From our perspective, Texas fundamental remain robust and you will not take much change in the supply demand balance to lead to scarcity pricing in the near term.","Turning to our hedge disclosures on slide 12, we increased our hedges prior to the winter which insulated us from the recent drop in natural gas prices. 2015 is well hedged leaving us in good shape to weather the current downturn. We expect to see some coal to gas switching but the financial impact will be muted for us. Just like we did in 2012, we are diligently working with fuel and transportation suppliers to ensure that our coal plants remain competitive during this extreme low natural gas price environment.","Finally, our goals for 2015 are pretty clear; execute on our asset optimization and development plan, and grow our distributor generation business by leveraging our wholesale portfolio.","With that, I will turn it over to Steve for the NRG Home review. ","Steve McBee","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning everyone. As we discussed recently at our Investor Conference in Houston and as David mentioned this morning in his remarks, it\u2019s our view at NRG that traditional centralized energy service models are significantly at risk. We believe that the future eventually will belong to demand driven decentralized models of service that empower individual consumers through sustainable energy solutions that are affordable, personalized, convenient and reliable.","NRG Home will continue to serve our customers through a robust traditional retail electric service franchise while at the same time position the business to win in a world where we believe at growing share of the market is going to want and expect to generate and manage a larger share of their own energy. As you can see from the data on page 14, our strong performance in 2014 positions us well to achieve both our near and longer term strategic and financial objective.","Our Home Retail platform delivered at the upper end of our original financial guidance with adjusted EBITDA of $604 million enabled in part by customer and product growth as well as by our ongoing commitment to continuous operational improvement to drive material reduction both in per customer cost and in bad debt. Our recurring customer account grew by 28% driven primarily by the Dominion acquisition which included customer contracts in the Northeast as well as the Cirro business in Texas.","We are pleased with the success of the Dominion acquisition which beat estimates of earnings and customer count delivered in 2014. We expect to continue to report the Dominion customer contracts separately to 2015 as many of the Northeast customers will roll off during the year\u2019s precious term contracts expire. Our customer growth also positions us retail business to accelerate and deepen cross selling of new products and services that will strengthen our business going forward. In that regard, we are exciting that our Home Retail platform which currently provides retail electricity and Home Solar will be in the market with new offerings this year that include portable power solutions, new battery products, and a variety of additional home services.","In 2014, NRG Home also established NRG Home Solar, a leading residential platform formed to the combination of NRG\u2019s legacy residential solar solutions team and the acquisition of RDS and of Pure Energies. We ended the year with over 13,000 Home Solar customers. Our success in ramping the business was a result of rapid and successful integration of our new and legacy Home Solar businesses, our strong kitchen table and telephone sales capabilities, our ability to leverage our key strategic partnerships and our ability to integrate additional NRG home services into our conventional Home Solar offering.","We also demonstrated early cross selling success between Home Solar and Home Retail with about 50% of eligible Home Solar customers supplementing their solar production with NRG\u2019s retail electricity. The strong foundation established for a residential solar business in 2014 positions us to be a top tier player in this rapidly growing space in 2015 and beyond.","If you flip to page 15, I\u2019ll quickly outline our priorities for 2015 before turning it over to Kirk. In 2015, we are confident that we will deliver on our Home Retail financial expectations and that we will establish our Home Solar business as a tier 1 player in the rapidly growing residential solar market. We will also operationalize the NRG Home platform towards our longer term goal of strengthening per customer EBITDA by further accelerating cross sell systems that increase tenure and by establishing common operating systems wherever we can to continue to incrementally reduce cost structure, and we will seek and pursue opportunities to scale our organic customer advantage and to enrich our existing product portfolio as we position NRG Home to become the dominant brand for clean and sustainable personal power solutions and services.","Thank you very much for your time this morning. And with that, I will turn it over to Kirk.","Kirkland Andrews","Thank you, Steve. Getting with the financial summary on slide 17, NRG is reporting fourth quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $625 million, with $382 million from Business & Renew, or $165 million from Home Retail, a $34 million negative contribution from Home Solar as we continue to position that business for growth, and $114 million from NRG Yield. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.128 billion with $2.134 billion from Business & Renew combined, $604 million from Home Retail, a full year of negative contribution from Home Solar of $65 million, and $455 million from NRG Yield.","Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, Business & Renew performance was down $26 million primarily from milder weather but partially offset by the acquisition of the EME assets, full commercial operation of CVSR and Ivanpah in 2014, and lower operating cost across the fleet. Retail EBITDA was lower by $15 million also driven by milder weather which was partially offset from the incremental margin from increased customers following the Dominion acquisition. Yield results improved by $21 million driven by the acquisition of the Alta Wind assets while we increased our investment in Home Solar by $32 million in the fourth quarter as compared to 2013. Free cash flow before growth totaled $951 million for the full year with $139 million inflow in the fourth quarter.","Turning your attention to our 2015 guidance and as discussed at our Investor Day, given our hedge levels, we are again reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion which now excludes the expected negative contribution of $100 million from investment in our growing Home Solar business. Free cash flow before growth guidance is also reaffirmed as we continue to expect between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2015.","Turning to slide 18, I\u2019d like to review a shareholder proposal by NRG Yield which is contained in the preliminary proxy statement filed by Yield last evening. This proposal which has been recommended by the NRG Yield independent directors and has the full support of NRG involves an important recapitalization of NRG Yield intended to achieve two important objectives. First, to preserve and maintain the strong strategic support of NRG Yield by NRG; and second, to enhance NRG Yield\u2019s flexibility to efficiently access capital to fund growth without the need for capital allocation by NRG towards additional investment in NRG Yield.","This proposal which requires the vote of a majority of the Class A shares of NRG Yield involves the creation of two classes of low vote NRG Yield stock which will be issued through a recapitalization of Yield\u2019s equity. NRG Yield would intend to use this new low vote as its primary means of raising equity capital to fund growth going forward. Basically the proposed recapitalization will take the form of 2:1 stock split of both classes of NRG Yield\u2019s stock. The Class A stock which is held by the public as well as the Class B stock which is held by NRG, thereby doubling the total number of NRG Yield shares outstanding.","The new low vote shares will be issued in two distinct classes due to the two classes stock current held by NRG and the public shareholders. NRG totaled approximately 42.7 million Class B shares will receive an equal number of Class D shares each with 1\/100th voting right. As NRG\u2019s economic interest is held exclusively through its direct interest in NRG Yield LLC, the new low vote Class E shares to be issued in NRG will have no economic rights. Each Class A shares held by the public will receive one share of Class C stock with the same economic rights as the Class A stock and a 1\/100th voting right. ","Immediately following the stock split, each shareholder will through their combined ownership of the classes of stock at the exact same economic and voting rights as they do today. Going forward NRG yield will be able to issue third party equity using C shares to fund acquisitions without the need for investment by NRG, as these types of acquisitions are best suited for NRG yield, while the focus of NRG\u2019s capital allocation to fund growth is focused on other core areas. ","The enhanced flexibility this provides is consistent with the rationale behind the original creation of NRG yield and preserves the important strategic partnership. NRGs economic ownership will be diluted through future issuances of Class C shares by NRG Yield to help fund growth. However, the proposed plan will allow for approximately $21 billion of equity to be issued based on today\u2019s share price before NRG\u2019s voting interest would fall below 50%, providing substantial headroom for additional equity capital.","In addition to the proposed recapitalization plan, NRG has agreed to add additional assets to the Right of First Offer Agreement. This expanded ROFO pipeline provides additional visibility in the NRG Yield to long term dividend growth and total return in order to preserve its low cost of capital advantage. The assets added to the expanded ROFO pipeline include NRG\u2019s Carlsbad and Mandalay repowering projects, recently awarded in the ongoing RFOs for new contract to generation in California.","Following CPUC approval, NRG will develop and construct these assets, which at COD may be offered to NRG yield, providing additional asset diversity in the years beyond the expected completion of the original ROFO pipeline. These types of projects enabled by and a testament to the strength of the NRG and NRG Yield partnership underscore the need for the enhanced flexibility for proposed recapitalization we will provide.","In terms of next steps, NRG Yield expects to file and distribute a definite proxy statement on\/or about March 26. NRG Yield has conditioned the proposal so it does require the approval of majority of the Class A shareholders at its Annual Meeting on May 5 of this year. NRG strongly supports the proposal as approved by the independent directors of NRG Yield and we ask for the support of the public shareholders of NRG Yield in this important step in building on the tremendous success of the NRG, NRG Yield relationship.","Finally updating our capital allocation progress on slide 19, NRG ended 2014 with an excess cash balance of $1.26 billion. This excess cash balance, which is net of minimum cash at NRG GenOn and NRG Yield when combined with NRG\u2019s increased 2015 free cash flow before growth investment guidance leads to $2.46 billion in consolidated cash available for allocation during 2015. Of this amount, we have committed nearly $1.7 billion of capital, including $250 million or approximately 20% of our 2015 free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through the combination of our recently completed stock buyback program announced last December, and a 4% increase in our annual dividend.","Our growth investments guidance of $900 million for 2015 is primarily driven by operational improvement initiatives across the fleet. Approximately $150 million of investment in Home Solar installations, as well as continued investments in Solar, Carbon 360 and eVgo. $800 million in remaining cash available for allocation, which is prior to any proceeds from NRG Yield drop downs in 2015 consisted $600 million at the GenOn level versus intended to fund our ongoing fuel conversation initiatives with the remaining $200 million at the NRG level.","Importantly, this balance does not reflect the impact of NRG Yield dropdowns in 2015. As we intend to offer NRG Yield, the next portfolio of ROFO assets, which we expect to consist of the remaining wind assets from the EME acquisition during the first half of 2015. The capital replenishment from this transaction will further increase NRG\u2019s excess capital. Specifically, when combined with the residential solar lease drop down, currently under evaluation at NRG Yield, the proceeds from the wind assets are expected to generate between $250 million and $300 million in cash to NRG.","Once this drop down is finalized in the first half of the year, we will revisit further capital allocation decisions based on conditions and opportunities at that time, which maybe further augmented by a second ROFO portfolio likely the remaining in stake in CBSR in late 2015.","With that I will turn it back to David for his closing remarks.","David Crane","Thank you Kirk. Let me close by turning to slide 21. Every year on this call I set forth my overarching goals across the enterprise so that you can follow our progress during the year. Given the reorientation of NRG into the NRG Group of companies, this year I\u2019m providing our key goals, or summarizing our key goals in the context of each of our businesses.","Now in the sphere of my opening remarks because we have taken up a lot of your time already, I will spear you from going through each of these sets of goals, but I will leave with the following. We remain steadfast as in orientation delivering on our commitments and while there are many goals on this page, we hope in excess effect that by the end of the year many of the newer initiatives that we have been nurturing and growing over the past few years will reach a size in the level of momentum where they will start to have a meaningful positive value impact on the overall NRG group alongside the intrinsic value of our almost 50,000 megawatts of conventional generation and our nearly 3 million retail customers.","And with that, Kevin, we are happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital.","Angie Storozynski","Yeah thank you. I have two questions here. First of all on the new share structure at NRG Yield, I mean it seems relatively complex and I\u2019m a little bit struggling here why wouldn\u2019t NRG be willing to simply accept a share of future equity issuances from NRG Yield, I mean in lieu maybe for cash and that way you could maintain not only your voting rights, but also the economic interest and best cash flow that will be flowing from NRG Yield. So, why wouldn\u2019t you want to actually keep the share of cash going forward?","David Crane ","Angie do you want to give us your second question too, so we can get time to think about.","Angie Storozynski","Yeah the second one is about residential solar, so it seems like NRG Yield would be just a tax equity investor in those projects and also it seems like you might have actually augmented the size of the residential portfolio since the Analyst Day. Thank you.","David Crane ","Well, so I think Kirk is going to answer the first question and half the second in terms of - I think you had a question about the growth trajectory of Home Solar as well?","Angie Storozynski","Yes.","David Crane ","Yes, so Kelcy will address that as well, but Kirk can you go ahead.","Kirkland Andrews","Sure. Angie the first part of your question as I think you know largely due to the successful equity issuance to fund the Alta Wind acquisition that being a third party acquisition, our current ownership stake in NRG Yield was about 55% and while we recognized the possibility at the offset that when we dropped down assets in the NRG Yield we may take some portion of that consideration in kind, it is a different proposition entirely to consider the possibility of incremental cash investment in NRG Yield to help support that ownership relationship.","What I mean by that is if you extrapolate it forward on a potential third party acquisition the size of the Alta Wind for example, in order for NRG to remain - to maintain its 50% plus ownership that would require NRG to actually allocate capital and invest in Yield equity, effectively investing in those types of projects over the long run and while certainly those projects are financially compelling.","It was a very motivation behind the creation of NRG Yield to separate those kind of investments so that they reside in a vehicle that\u2019s properly positioned for that kind of risk in a return profile. So - because those assets are high EBITDA multiple that would be tandem out to NRG investing capital or allocating capital towards a high EBITDA multiple. This allows us to allocate that capital appropriately towards the types of investments conventional in the life and towards some of the growth initiatives at NRG that are more appropriately our core focus.","I think on the second part of your question although I think we\u2019ve outlined the structure within the relationship between NRG and NRG Yield the important distinction here is we plan of tax equity financings, primarily the tax attributes from residential solar leases as they drop down to NRG Yield. ","NRG Yield\u2019s participation in that is actually investing in the residual equity after tax equity. So, NRG Yield is not providing tax equity and using tax equity allows us to manage effectively the duration of that tax holiday or that tax run way if you will. We have the flexibility from time to time to drop down assets without tax attributes giving NRG Yield the ability to augment its tax yielding ability, but I think given the nature of the broader portfolio we use tax equity to out manage that.","David Crane","Kelcy, do you like to say about sales.","Kelcy Pegler","Sure. So in 2014, we\u2019ve really focused on building out and optimizing our platform for the residential solar space as we talked about in Investors Day, and we finished 2014 with over 13,000 cumulative customers of which 9,000 were acquired in 2014. As we look forward to \u201915, we will continue this momentum and we continue to target 35,000 to 40,000 cumulative customers for 2015.","Angie Storozynski","Okay and then just one follow-up to that again David, the recapitalization of NRG Yield, should we imply from it that there is basically a big third party acquisition coming that you don\u2019t want to chip in with cash and hence the change in the share structure.","David Crane","Angie, Angie, Angie. Do you know, we never comment on anything that\u2026","Angie Storozynski","I have to try.","David Crane","May or may not be happening, but having said that I won\u2019t comment on it \u2013 I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the right premise in terms of any specific thing. This recapitalization is just forward-looking looking at how suboptimal it is to use high cost NRG equity capital in NRG Yield, but we are trying to maintain alignment on the control side.","I would say though while you\u2019re not going to wake up tomorrow and read about some massive NRG Yield acquisition, it is a target rich environment for NRG Yield, small, medium, large, there is a lot of things knocking about. So we are active in that market, but this was not driven by any specific transaction that may or may not happen.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning.","David Crane","Morning.","Greg Gordon","Looking at the full year results and then trying to compare them back to the third quarter guidance ranges for the segments and then bridging for the new segments, just want to make sure I am reading correctly that Business\/Renew came in more or less inside the range but it looks like you\u2019re may be still a little bit more upfront on Home Solar and you are initially projected and came in a little light in Retail. Is that the correct read or the wrong read because while the outlook for \u201915 looks great, you came in on a low side of the guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth in \u201914.","Kirkland Andrews","Sure. Greg, its Kirk. And I am just referring you back to some of my remarks at the Investor Day presentation where we went through recasting the components of those segments. We\u2019ve recast the segments on a historic basis in 2014 to reflect Home Retail as oppose to what we used to call for Retail. That segment that was Retail that was comprised of our guidance contain about $50 million of EBITDA from the C&I business. That $50 million, that portion of our performance, is now reflected in the business segments. So that $604 million you see from Retail in 2014 is simply the mass retail component of that.","And yes, the $65 million in negative EBITDA contribution from Home Solar is slightly ahead of what we expected, but that was due to some advanced investments in cost initiatives and marketing like as we position ourselves continually to realize that significant growth objective in 2015.","Greg Gordon","Great. And on that front, it does seem to appear that you\u2019re slightly ahead of plan in terms of the number of Home Solar customers you signed up into the end of the year, is that right or not?","Kirkland Andrews","I think we are right within the ballpark of the growth trajectory through the full year of 2015.","Greg Gordon","Great. And the cross selling opportunities you mentioned earlier, are they significantly accretive to the base case plan you laid out. Are you seeing more cross selling opportunities than you would have expected in the base case plan at this juncture or is it more or less along the trend of that plan?","David Crane","Greg, I would think that the way you should think about cross selling and I got to tell you the number of ways within our company that see cross selling opportunity is the number of permutations and combinations. I mean the obvious one may be between system power retail and solar power, but the correlation between solar power, Home Solar and electric vehicle charging is a 58% correlation.","But in terms of impacting our results, what I would tell you right now is, we feel in the cross selling area that we have to prove with you and get it to a scale where it\u2019s actually having impact before we start asking you to value it. And I will say right now, we will consider ourselves more in the demonstration phase. Kelcy is working with Elizabeth, they\u2019re going to be working with the electric vehicle charging folks and so we are just proving things out and we are just telling you that stay tuned. Kirk, do you?","Kirkland Andrews","Yeah. I think, Greg, one of your questions about our performance in 2014 if I recall I think I may have missed addressing the question you had on free cash flow, is that correct?","Greg Gordon","Yeah.","Kirkland Andrews","Yes. Our free cash flow before growth in 2014 of $951, obviously that\u2019s within the range of guidance we provided obviously towards the lower end of that range. That\u2019s primarily due to the fact that despite when we guided in the third quarter in anticipation of potential colder weather learning from the lessons and the success we had of the polar vortex. We chose to make some additional investments in a be prepared strategy specifically in our fuel inventory going into 2015 actually around oil in anticipation of potential colder weather, and that\u2019s primarily the reason why the free cash flow before growth for 2014 although within our range was trending toward the lower end.","Greg Gordon","Got it. Thank you guys.","Kirkland Andrews","You bet.","David Crane","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with UBS.","Paul Zimbardo","Hi, thank you, good morning.","David Crane","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Zimbardo","A follow-up question on the proposed change in share classes? Just a high level question, where there any kind of lessons learned from some of the subsequent yield curves that you tried to add to the structure or was there some reason why you didn\u2019t opt to try and add some permutation of incentive distribution right.","Kirkland Andrews","Well, I think in terms of the other structures that are out there, I think we feel comfortable with the incremental impact on the governance perspective that\u2019s quite in line with the governance provisions contained in some of the yield curves that followed. But as I\u2019ve said a number of times, our primary goal is to ensure that NRG Yield has a maximum competitive advantage and low cost of capital. And from our perspective, the best means to do is for NRG Yield to realize the maximum incremental potential CAFD without the drag if you will of an IDR.","The other element of that is that the NRG level because the IDR would basically be cash flow or EBITDA back to NRG which obviously goes back to an entity with a lower EBITDA multiple, we wanted to maximize that portion of the cash flows that was associated with those contracted plans to ensure that it traded at the higher valuation. And we think the absence of an IDR addresses that issue as well as the fact it ensures the NRG Yield can be more competitive and we will have a competitive advantage from a realization of accretion relative to some of the other competitors out there whose IDRs can deter or detract from the accretion when we compete for assets and third party market.","David Crane","Hey, Paul, can I just add something more general to what Kirk saying because this question of IDR, while Kirk just tried to explain the IDR is about 16 times and I am just mentally and capable of understanding. But I would tell you in general terms when it comes to yield curves, we monitor closely all the activity in the general yield coal market. And it seems to me and you probably could tell me, you can certainly tell me better if this is true or not that the market is now to the point where as oppose to buying every yield curve that comes out, they are starting to differentiate between quality yield curves and lesser quality. And we are committed at NRG that NRG Yield is going to be a top quality yield curve. So on every basic metric that the yield community is looking at, we want ours to be in the top tier and so we are constantly following the situation, that\u2019s goal and we\u2019re going to stick to it.","Paul Zimbardo","Okay great, thanks. I appreciate the color. And then a follow-up question on the Home Retail and Home Solar, for the target of the 35,000 to 40,000 customers, is that based primarily on conversion and cross selling of existing customers or is that expansion to new customers.","David Crane","Kelcy?","Kelcy Pegler","No, it\u2019s not based on cross selling. I think the cross selling initiatives that Elizabeth and I are working with Steve on are really in the developmental phase where we are getting proof of concept. The customer count of the 35,000 to 40,000 in \u201915 is not based on the cross selling initiatives.","Paul Zimbardo","Okay, great. Thank you very much for the time.","David Crane","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Good morning.","David Crane","Steven.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to start on Texas and just get your thinking on environmental regulations, looks like your coal fleet is in very good shape. Just curious as you think about all of the rules that are coming down the road here CSAPR and regional haze and clean power. Which in your mind are likely to be most impactful to your competition and what\u2019s the general timeframe we should be thinking about in terms of the impact to your competition in the state?","David Crane","Steven, thanks for the question and Mauricio is going to do the heavy lifting and answer the question. But I do want to say as a general rule may be for some of the investors on the phone that don\u2019t follow this space as closely as you, because all of these environmental regulations either proposed in the court stay federal level, it\u2019s very complicated. But I would say to you a general rule, even with the coal plants that we own because of our investment in the back and controls as you alluded to in Texas. ","For us as well as the rules that are imposed in a fair and reasonable way, tightening environmental regulations actually enhances relative to our competition. So with that general statement as to your specific question about I think you asked what is the most impactful of the environmental rules that may or may not come back. And is your question specifically about Texas or across the fleet?","Stephen Byrd","Texas.","David Crane","Okay.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Hey, Stephen, good morning.","Stephen Byrd","Morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez","I think from our perspective and your question was the most impactful to our competitors. ","Stephen Byrd","Really more to your competitors and thinking about\u2026","Mauricio Gutierrez","I think it was primarily our competitors given that as you already alluded and we tried to highlight that on our earnings slide. Our portfolio is pretty well positioned to comply with both maps, CSAPR and I think the latest one is regional haze. I think it\u2019s fair to say that regional haze will have a significant impact on our competitors and not necessarily at NRG. With respect to Parish, we don\u2019t think that is going to be applicable because even if we install scrubbers don\u2019t have a significant impact on visibility. So take Parish shop and Langston will require minimal upgrades on the scrubbers that we have today. So I mean all of them will have some impact, right.","The question is the timeline and the implementation of all these rules. But I think during Investor Day, we actually quantify the potential impact of each of these regulations on coal markets and what I would say is, most of that impact will happen on coal plants that are not owned by NRG.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","David Crane","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Yeah, hi, good morning.","David Crane","Hi, Steve.","Steven Fleishman","Hi, couple of quick ones. First, at the Analyst Day I think you said you are tracking to the upper half of the 2015 guidance range. I don\u2019t think I heard you say that again, is that still true?","David Crane","To correct the record, we actually said to the upper most quartile. So, okay, Kirk, Steve Fleishman has called you out. What you\u2019re going to say now?","Kirkland Andrews","Yes, Steve. You can infer which I\u2019ll confirm right now by reaffirming our guidance that we also did on the Investor Day that, yes, our expectations are still consistent with that upper quartile.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","David Crane","Steve, what I deal with here, how hard it is to get him to say something.","Steven Fleishman","And then just on the new structure for NRG Yield, I guess it\u2019s for Kirk, will you still be consolidating it from an accounting standpoint and also does it change anyway that it\u2019s treated from credit rating standpoint for you guys?","Kirkland Andrews","First of all, we don\u2019t expect that to have much of an impact on the credit rating although early days and so we get some feedbacks from the rating agency, but I would not expect that to have an impact other than the fact that obviously it doesn\u2019t entail or give some greater transparency of the lack of at least necessity for capital allocation towards maintaining that ownership by buying more NRG Yield shares if you will. So I don\u2019t expect that to be the case. ","And forgive me, Steve, would you remain me your other question?","Steven Fleishman","Accounting consolidation.","Kirkland Andrews","Oh sure, yes. Because this structure is really a structure that impacts economics and not vote and it is vote that is the determinant of consolidation from a GAAP perspective, we will continue to consolidate NRG Yield going forward.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then lastly, I think Mauricio mentioned on the repowering and the like something about GCP capacity auction outcome maybe being reported to data point for some of them at least and continuing them, could you elaborate a little bit more on that?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, Steven. Good morning. As we articulated on the Investor Day, we are looking at repositioning the portfolio particularly around field conversions and environmental CapEx. And as you can appreciate, some of those investments are focused primarily on capacity revenues. So the outcome of the capacity performance auction is pretty important. Now, we are encouraged by the data point that the most recent New England capacity auction provided to us. So while we have all the economic analysis and we have put out \u2013 we have outlined the asset optimization plan, we want to have some certainty in terms of what is the final rule and I guess the rules of the game before we make any incremental capital commitment.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","David Crane","Thanks, Steve. And Kevin, we want to end really at 10 o'clock as we have a 10:30 NRG Yield call, and we got some things to do in the meantime. So we will take two more questions please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Hi guys. Quick one on, you are not going to need to purchase more NRG Yield shares, but could you and under what circumstances might you consider selling down some of your interest post the conversion or should we just anticipate that the ownership percentage of decline is yield growth?","Kirkland Andrews","Addressing that reverse order, yes, that is what the expectation is, is that our ownership stake will reduce overtime as NRG Yield issues equity, not as NRG sells down equity. The latter of those two is not our intention, however just to be clear the structure affords us the ability to do so. We have to convert the units that we own into shares but that is not our intention at this time moving forward.","Jonathan Arnold","Thanks. Is the split is simply just for liquidity and future issuance optimization, is that right?","Kirkland Andrews","Basically, yes, that\u2019s right.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Thank you.","David Crane","Thanks, Jonathan. So last question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays.","Gregg Orrill","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on the Carlsbad comments, you said you expect that to come online in fall of \u201917. Just I guess may be more specifically how do you expect to run the facility and how much would your \u2013 the powering cost and how should we think about the benefits of that?","Kirkland Andrews","Sure, Gregg. It\u2019s Kirk. We haven\u2019t yet provided the capital cost of that. The best thing that I can give you is that, the Carlsbad project is a little over 600 megawatts in total size for that. And the one thing I can say is that and I provided guidance similar to this when folks have asked us about some of the conventional plants that were in the ROFO portfolio and how to think about things like CAFD. And certainly we expect the project to finance that using a construction facility in permanent amortizing loan in similar fashion we\u2019ve done in the past.","My expectation is that the cash available for distribution or the equity cash flows coming off of that project will be similar on average cash flow per megawatt basis. And to give you a sense if you look back and I\u2019ve made these remarks before in addressing this question with respect to the assets that are in NRG Yield today, that range on our equity cash flow or CAFD per megawatt basis is in the $35 to $45 kw range.","Gregg Orrill","Thank you.","David Crane","So, Kevin, I think we are reaching the top of the hour. So I just want to thank everyone for participating in the call and for those who are going to participate in the NRG Yield call at 10:30, I am not sure there will be all that much more new information there, but at least you will get to see us wearing our NRG Yield hats if you choose to join. And thank you very much and we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chad Plotkin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Chad Plotkin","Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, and welcome to NRG's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts. [Operator Instructions].","As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may be -- that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective.","Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumption that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in today's presentation as well as the risk factors contained in our SEC filings.

Crane","Thank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this last earnings call of 2014. As always, joining me today are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and they'll both be giving part of the presentation. In addition to Kirk and Mauricio, Chris Moser who runs our Commercial Operations, Elizabeth Killinger who's Head of Retail are available for questions. And lastly, making his first, but hopefully not his last appearance on a quarterly earnings call is Kelcy Pegler, Jr. who runs NRG Home Solar. He also will be available to answer any questions you have in his area.","Turning to Slide 3. On our last earnings call in early August, we noted that through the first part of the summer, there had been nothing in the way of extreme heat in any of our core markets. As a result, there had been no scarcity pricing of the type that our Wholesale generation depends upon. Scarcity pricing is particularly important in an energy-only market like ERCOT where it is intended to act as a de facto capacity payment.","With the summer now well past, you know by now that across all of our power markets, summer never materialized. The predictable consequence of the moderate summer we report today, adapting of our third quarter financial performance and a softening of the forward curve near term adversely affecting the outlook for the balance of 2014. Under these weather circumstances, I think our financial results for the quarter were as good as could be expected, and while today, we are reducing our full year EBITDA guidance by 5%, and I take no satisfaction in reducing guidance, I do take a little comfort from the fact that our full year guidance, as revised, actually remains at the high end of our original guidance for fiscal year 2014 even when excluding the impact of the acquisitions we closed earlier in the year. This is highlighted in the bar chart on the bottom right quadrant of Slide 3 in order to permit an apples-to-apples comparison.","What makes me more positive than the revised 2014 guidance are 2 other factors: first, notwithstanding the third quarter headwinds associated with the weather, our Wholesale generation fleet performed up to our very high expectations on virtually every metric and that is a result of the culture of continuous improvement instilled by Mauricio and his operations team; and secondly, I feel good about our prospects to grow the business in 2015 and beyond across all of our various lines of business. As such, I'm pleased to announce the 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This guidance, I would note, excludes the impact of our fast-growing Home Solar business, which is, at this point, in the evolution of the residential solar business build-out, a sector in which negative EBITDA is the norm for the leading industry players and financial success is measured by other metrics, which Kirk will discuss later.","Lastly, as we acknowledged on our last quarterly call, we recognize and appreciate that NRG is a complicated company to understand and properly value at this stage. We are dual focused, both on winning the short- to medium-term future of our business based on the current 20th century conventional grid-based paradigm while also preparing to win the medium- to long-term future of our industry as its 21st century paradigm takes shape.","So rather than expand on my thoughts on this earnings call, I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting our first Investor Day in over 5 years this coming January. You will hear more of the details from Chad and the IR team about this must-attend event in the coming weeks.","Moving to Slide 4 and coming back for a moment to our strength of execution. Last quarter, we spoke about the Edison Mission transaction and how our integration and asset optimization capabilities led us to an improved outcome from our original expectation. We've also stated on several occasions that our efforts on integrating the Dominion retail acquisition were also trending favorably, as well. As these 2 acquisition integration efforts, which I might point out we're implementing almost simultaneously, reach their completion, I'm pleased to report that, in each case, we have not only delivered on our commitment to you but exceeded our expectations. We are ahead of schedule and we are exceeding our targets in respect of key financial and operating metrics. I think our success in a management and systems-intensive endeavor like large-scale integrations demonstrates that this company and our people across the organization continue to be singularly focused on getting the task at hand done quickly and efficiently.","Moving to Slide 5. We are pleased to announce today that NRG West has been awarded a number of contracts totaling 440 megawatts in aggregate in Southern California Edison's recent RFP for fast-start gas units and what they refer to as Preferred Resources. The 178 megawatts of Preferreds' Resources, which encompasses demand response and energy efficiency, is a particularly important win for us because we believe, California, as it has so often in the past, is a trendsetter in this area. In just California alone, the public policy is shifting towards Preferred Resources, making it 50% of all future resource procurement. By winning this award and winning big, we are positioning NRG for first-mover advantage with all the benefits that, that entails as Preferred Resources become a more significant part of the energy mix for load-serving entities across the United States.","The other part of the award, the 262-megawatt Mandalay project now joins our 600-megawatt Carlsbad project, which is currently awaiting CPUC approval, as critical examples of how NRG is replacing and updating its aging conventional generation assets with smaller, more flexible, renewable-friendly, fast-start peaking units on long-term contract. It also obviously demonstrates our ability through intrinsic growth from development to restock the pipeline of NRG Yield-eligible assets, ensuring that NRG can maintain NRG Yield's double-digit growth profile into the next decade. Most of all, our success in this critical solicitation from SCE, one of NRG's most valued customers, shows that NRG is prepared to fulfill our role as an integral player in the critical California market now and well into the future.","Turning on to Slide 6 to the Residential Solar business. We've made no secret of the importance that we attach to success in this area. We've been developing our capabilities in residential solar for a few years, but we have been very light on detail when it comes to speaking with you on how we think you should be thinking about this business embedded as it is within NRG. Obviously, a good deal of our reticence was driven by our desire to build the capabilities we felt we needed in this area outside of the public eye. As a big player relative to the companies currently in the field, we did not want to telegraph our approach to the business. While there continue to be many market-sensitive details of our approach that we are not prepared to disclose, on this Slide 6, we begin to pull back the curtain. The first thing you need to know is that while the graphs on Slide 6 focus almost exclusively on home solar performance metrics, you will see that our home solar business is going to be about so much more about than just solar panels on the roof and we consider that one of our greatest advantages. Our homes solar business is going to be about marrying up, cross-selling and seamless integration of solar-driven home energy solutions, including complementary grid system sales, backup generation and other energy products and services. And in this regard, unlike other residential solar companies that talk about offering more than just solar to their customer base, we already have the capabilities in place to offer effectively many of these complementary products and services. You can safely assume that we will expand upon our efforts to provide an appropriate level of detail about our home business -- our home solar business at our Investor Day.","So let me just give you a brief overview of where we are and where I see our activities leading over the coming year. Focusing, as I said, purely on the home solar business itself for today, we have created a very strong business platform. Starting with our original NRG residential solar solutions and now combined with both RDS and Pure Energies through acquisition, we now believe we have the premier one-stop shop for customers seeking a high-quality solar experience at their homes. We have the multichannel customer acquisition engine necessary to achieve the appropriate scale. We have the systems necessary to accommodate rapid expansion and we have the financial acumen in place to finance our growth in an optimized manner.","Specifically, on the financing side, we are ramping up with tax equity financing, either closed or in negotiation, to support nearly $600 million of residential leases in the near term.","On the operations side, we are driving down installation timing and improving the customer adoption process so that we can reduce substantially the wait times from customer sale to install completion. By the end of this year, we expect to have over 10,000 installations, which is about 70 megawatts. By the end of 2015, we expect to grow that amount by 3x with an objective of a total of 35 to 40,000 installations or roughly 280 megawatts.","Lastly, and given our focus on operational excellence and continuous improvement, we see our costs coming down to where we can install and offer residential solar between $3.20 to $3.30 per watt in 2015 with further cost reductions occurring in the years beyond. We look forward to updating you more on that -- on these efforts in January.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning. We delivered another quarter of strong results despite the lack of weather and the corresponding weak prices. More importantly, the relative varied sentiment from the summer was more than offset by the positive activity on the regulatory front. Changes in capacity markets stemming from reliability concerns, post-polar vortex, implementation of environmental regulations and the uncertainty around demand response are all contributing to a robust future across the wholesale markets. Throughout the quarter, we continue to focus on repositioning our Wholesale portfolio to win in both the short and long terms, either by extending the life of assets through fuel conversions or repowering facilities at a significant discount to greenfield economics. These actions give us an opportunity to withstand low commodity prices like the ones we experienced this past summer while standing ready to participate in market recovery.","Given the circumstances, our portfolio performed quite well. The diversity in our generation portfolio, our hedging strategy, the integrated platform between Wholesale and Retail and our focus on operational improvements all contributed to achieving a solid quarter.","Turning to our operational performance on Slide 8. I am particularly pleased with the safety performance of the organization. After 2 years of continuous integration, we're back to top decile levels. We had 146 out of 161 facilities that finished the quarter without a single recordable injury. Overall, generation for the quarter was slightly down, driven primarily by lower coal and gas generation in both Texas and the East despite better reliability and availability metrics. This was somewhat offset by higher gas generation in the West and South Central regions, but particularly the significant increase in renewable generation. Also our gas portfolio experienced a significant decrease in the number of starts due to lower cycling at Cottonwood and lax scarcity pricing in the East. This again highlights the value of our balanced portfolio between contracted and merchant assets during periods of low power prices.","Turning to Slide 9. Our Retail business performed quite well and met our expectations for the quarter when factoring in both the impact of the Dominion acquisition as well as continued organic growth relative to the same period in 2013. More importantly, however, we achieved these results by realizing higher retail margins despite the introduction of the Dominion portfolio, which generally came in with lower-margin customers.","As David mentioned earlier, the Dominion integration is now complete and performance has exceeded expectations. Since the close of the deal, Retail has retained higher-than-planned customer count and realized favorable EBITDA contributions with customer retention and expense management being the key drivers of much better-than-planned results on EBITDA and customer count. The Northeast drove the customer count overperformance with Texas driving the cost efficiencies.","Lastly, with the closing of the Goal Zero acquisition in September and momentum building with NRG Home Solar, we have expanded the breadth of bundled products offerings across our markets. Our Home Solar team began selling system power along with residential solar and experienced nearly 50% success rate in cross-selling. At the end of the third quarter, 20% of Texas customers were buying more than 1 product from NRG and were gaining momentum with cross-selling in the Northeast. Overall, as more and more customers subscribe to multiple products and services, we expect our Retail platform to demonstrate enhanced growth and improved retention, allowing us to realize more value from each customer.","Moving on to Slide 10, and as we mentioned before, it was another summer of weak prices and lack of weather across the country. While, on the surface, weather was slightly below normal in the Northeast and close to normal in Texas, the number of hot days was unusually low and as you can see in the lower left-hand chart. In some cases, like in Texas, the first 100-degree day occurred well into the summer, resulting in much lower spot power prices, particularly when you compare them against the same forward prices before the third quarter. This milder weather, combined with lower gas prices due to the higher production coming out of the Marcellus Shale, put some downward pressure on forward power prices during the summer. Since then, we have seen some recovery in forward prices, particularly in the Northeast, where they are back to presummer levels due in part to upcoming environmental regulations and concerns of cooler weather this winter.","I want to take this opportunity to remind everyone about our summer hedging policy. While we increased our hedges in the aftermath of the polar vortex, we maintained a long reserve opening for the cash markets as a matter of prudent risk management. These megawatts were affected by the lack of scarcity pricing and therefore exposed to weak spot prices. This is something we implemented a few years back to ensure NRG would benefit from higher wholesale prices despite operational issues or higher retail levels. While we manage the size of this open position based on prices, we will continue to lean long in future summers consistent with our view.","Moving on to Slide 11 and starting with PJM. We see a number of positive trends in our Wholesale business. The implementation of environmental rules like MATS, IPP or CSAPR next year, in combination with the uncertainty around demand response, most likely will take megawatts out of the supply stack and provide a positive momentum for both energy and capacity prices. In addition, PJM is in the process of making significant improvements to their capacity markets. It was clear that in the aftermath of the polar vortex event, units that provide a reliability and fuel certainty were at risk of retiring due to economics under the existing market structure. PJM recognized this shortcoming and it is recommending improvements to explicitly recognize the value of these units provided to the system. The new capacity performance market, while still under works, is designed to compensate generation resources that provide fuel certainty and reliability during peak weather conditions. We believe this is an important and necessary enhancement to the capacity markets, particularly if the system becomes more dependent from natural gas for power generation. We continue to work closely with all stakeholders and believe the market redesign is getting close to achieving the desired objectives.","In Texas, fundamentals remained strong, particularly on the demand side. Demand grew 2.7% on a weather-normalized basis for the year and market design changes, including higher price caps and the implementation of an operating demand curve, are positive improvements for the energy-only market. Although we continue to believe they're not adequate long-term solutions to address resource adequacy issues, these measures should improve pricing as to better dispatch the electric system. As you can see on the upper right-hand chart, neither historical nor forward prices support long-term greenfield development. Market participants continue to focus on brownfield sites where cost advantages are necessary to manage the low-price environment that we have seen in the past couple of years while getting access to the fundamentally robust Texas market.","Earlier this year, we announced the mothballing of our Bertron plant in Houston given the lack of support for capacity markets. With the benefit of hindsight, it proved to be the right decision given the lack of scarcity pricing this summer. But as we move forward, we need to renovate our fleet to remain competitive in the evolving Texas market. Our development efforts are predicated on either long-term contracts or units with a significant cost advantage where we don't have to take disproportionate market risk. Today, we are announcing the construction of a 360-megawatt peaking facility at the former PH Robinson brownfield site, which will be operational in late 2015.","In natural gas, fast-start combustion turbines will help the state of Texas integrate the growing intermittent renewable generation while using no water for cooling and taking advantage of higher price caps and potential scarcity pricing. The plan meets our criteria of an ideal location in Houston and it is suspected to be built at a significant discount to traditional, new-build economics.","Finally, on October 23, the D.C. court lifted the stay imposed nearly 3 years ago on the CSAPR rule. All arguments to address open issues are scheduled for March of next year. While this rule will continue to be contested and it is difficult to speculate on the final outcome, particularly pertaining to Texas, the EPA intends to start the rule in January 1, 2015. Our compliance program is a multi-pronged strategy, which includes using allowances, optimizing existing back-end controls, fuel switching and the use of low-sulfur PRB coal. We don't expect the rule to have a significant impact on this batch economics in the near term, but it could become a catalyst for additional coal retirements in lignite-heavy states like Texas, if implemented.","Turning to our hedge disclosures on Slide 12. We decided to increase our coal and nuclear hedge levels for both gas as a proxy for power and heat rate for 2015 and 2016 in light of the weak summer prices and increasing gas production. We now stand at 94% hedge in 2015 and 45% in 2016, significantly reducing our exposure to near-term market dynamics. Coal hedges remain well balanced and fuel inventories are being replenished ahead of the winter months despite some of the rail performance issues that have affected our industry. We're focused on executing our fall outage season and reassessing the asset optimization projects that we have shared with you in previous calls in light of the changes in capacity markets across our core regions. We will update you in the near future once these changes have been finalized.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio. I'm beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14. NRG is reporting adjusted EBITDA of just over $1 billion for the third quarter with $678 million from Wholesale, $196 million from Retail and $140 million from NRG Yield.","Through the first 9 months of 2014, adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.5 billion, with $1.683 billion from Wholesale, $477 million from Retail and $341 million from NRG Yield. Despite the lack of price volatility and lower generation during the quarter, total consolidated EBITDA was flat compared to third quarter 2013 due to higher contributions from Retail, which benefited from increased margins from Dominion as well as continued customer growth.","EBITDA from the newly acquired EME assets and NRG Yield, combined with these higher Retail results, serve to offset lower Wholesale EBITDA for the quarter.","For the third quarter, free cash flow before growth totaled approximately $0.5 billion, driving just over $800 million in free cash flow over the first 9 months of the year.","Turning to highlights and updating our progress on drop-downs to NRG Yield, we're pleased to announce that we've now executed a definitive agreement for the drop-down of a second set of assets for $480 million in cash, which we expect to close by the end of the year. This transaction, when combined with the previously executed drop-down in the second quarter, will bring total cash proceeds from drop-downs during 2014 to $830 million, providing significant capital replenishment to NRG while driving dividend growth at Yield.","As previously announced, NRG Yield also closed the acquisition of the Alta Wind assets on August 12, which will further support Yield's growth through $220 million of incremental run rate adjusted EBITDA and $70 million of annual cash build for distribution by 2016 once the remaining 2 PPAs for Alta 10 and 11 are in effect.","In addition, following the quarter end, NRG closed a new tax equity facility permitting us to immediately monetize future tax benefits, consisting largely of PTCs to be generated primarily by the NRG Yield-eligible wind assets we acquired earlier this year as a part of the EME transaction. NRG received approximately $190 million in net cash proceeds from the transaction, in effect, representing an advance on monetizing these assets through future drop-downs to NRG Yield and further replenishing capital to NRG in 2014. This tax equity facility is structured to maintain the level-ized cash available for distribution from the wind assets, thereby preserving our ability to monetize these cash flows from the assets through drop-downs to NRG Yield beyond 2014.","Finally, while executing on value-enhancing, bolt-on transactions and completing our refinancing of NRG's unsecured notes during the third quarter, we maintained NRG's continued strong consolidated liquidity position, which is largely unchanged at $3.6 billion as of quarter end and now further enhanced by the wind tax equity proceeds, which closed subsequent to the quarter.","Turning to the guidance overview on Slide 15. As I mentioned on our second quarter call, in the absence of warmer summer weather and higher prices over the balance of the year, our expectations for 2014 adjusted EBITDA were trending to the lower end of guidance. The lack of extreme heat and scarcity pricing and resultant lower EBITDA over the balance of the summer, combined with expected results over the balance of the year, has placed our 2014 expectations now at or modestly below our prior guidance range, and we are revising and narrowing our 2014 EBITDA guidance to $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion.","The reduction in Wholesale guidance is partially offset by NRG Yield, which has been revised upward to reflect the partial year impact of the Alta Wind transaction, which closed during the third quarter while Retail remains on track with prior guidance with a slightly tighter range of $620 million to $650 million.","Our 2014 EBITDA guidance also includes the impact of approximately $50 million in negative EBITDA from the home solar business, reflecting overhead and customer acquisition costs as we position the business for significant growth next year. Our revised EBITDA guidance range net of the contribution from the EME transaction, which as you'll recall was approximately $250 million this year, still places us on track to the upper end of our original guidance range for 2014 as the positive impact from operational performance during the first quarter more than offset the impact of lower prices and generation later in the year.","We are also reducing and narrowing our guidance range for 2014 free cash flow before growth, based in part on the reduction in EBITDA guidance as well as other revisions to free cash flow expectations over the balance of the year. These revisions total approximately $150 million and consists of 3 elements: first, the impact of interest expense from both the Alta Wind transaction as well as interest expense resulting from the timing of the final redemption of our 2019 senior notes completed in September; second, mindful of the critical need for preparedness, which benefited us during the colder weather in the first quarter, we've accelerated a portion of our oil and coal inventory build from 2015 into 2014 in advance of the winter months in order to insulate the portfolio from any delivery challenges, which may result from higher rail demand or other potential transport disruptions over the winter; finally, changes in working capital largely due to the expected timing of Wholesale revenue now later in the year, partially offset by changes in timing for environmental capital expenditures, make up the balance of the expected changes for free cash flow this year. The majority of these changes are timing-related and should reverse as we move into 2015. Importantly, the proceeds from the wind tax equity transaction more than offset these largely temporary differences in cash flow, helping to maintain over $1 billion in consolidated excess cash available for allocation over the balance of the year, which I'll review in greater detail shortly.","Turning to 2015. We are initiating full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion, including Wholesale EBITDA of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion; Retail, which is expected to deliver $625 million to $700 million in 2015. NRG Yield, which makes up the balance of our guidance range, reflects an increase of $130 million primarily due to the full year impact of the Alta Wind transaction.","Our 2015 guidance excludes the anticipated impact of NRG Home Solar, which we expect to generate approximately $100 million in net operating costs as overhead and customer acquisition costs reflect the rapid growth in lease volume only partially offset by gross margin from leases in service through 2015. Next year, we expect an incremental 25,000 to 30,000 home solar installations, which, net of tax equity proceeds, will require less than $150 million in incremental NRG capital in 2015.","Including fully allocated overhead, we expect NRG return, net of tax equity, in excess of 8%, positioning NRG to capitalize on low-cost opportunities for further lease monetization at a premium to fully installed costs. And we will provide further details on this at our upcoming Investor Day in January.","Our 2015 free cash flow before growth guidance, which is net of maintenance and environmental capital, including planned spend on Midwest Gen fuel conversions and back end controls, remains a robust $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for 2015.","Turning to Slide 16, I'll review in greater detail the second drop-down of assets to NRG Yield for $480 million in cash. These assets represent the first drop-down and monetization of Yield-eligible assets acquired from Edison Mission consisting of Walnut Creek, a fast-start natural gas-fired facility under a 10-year contract with Southern California Edison; Tapestry, a portfolio of wind assets in West Virginia and Oklahoma under 20- to 25-year PPAs; and Laredo Ridge, a Nebraska-based wind facility under a 20-year PPA. This second drop-down portfolio is expected to generate approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA and $35 million in cash build for distribution at NRG Yield, helping to drive near-term dividend growth at Yield. An additional $100 million in cash available for distribution remains available through drop-downs over the balance of the NRG ROFO assets and the EME-eligible wind assets beyond 2014, providing Yield the means to deliver on its long-term growth targets.","In connection with the transaction, at closing, NRG Yield will also assume approximately $746 million of nonrecourse project debt. This debt balance includes a pro forma increase of $40 million of incremental debt at Laredo Ridge, resulting from a pending refinancing of the existing project debt, which will close prior to drop-down. This refinancing, which takes advantage of the lower prevailing financing rates, maintains existing debt service and CAFD while cash proceeds from the increased project debt will be paid as a dividend to NRG prior to the drop-down, supplementing the $480 million in proceeds from the transaction. The cash purchase price and assumed debt implies a transaction enterprise value of approximately $1.2 billion or just north of 10.2x 2015 adjusted EBITDA while the equity purchase price implies a CAFD yield of 7.3%. NRG Yield will fund the transaction using excess cash on hand of approximately $280 million with the balance of the purchase price funded to be a temporary draw on NRG Yield's revolving credit facility, which had approximately $420 million in capacity at quarter end. NRG Yield expects to repay the revolver in 2015 from the proceeds of its next capital raise.","And finally, updating our capital allocation progress on Slide 17. NRG's 2014 remaining consolidated cash build for allocation, which is net of $2 billion of capital previously committed, stands at approximately $1.1 billion. $700 million of this cash resides to GenOn level and is primarily earmarked to fund committed growth investments at GenOn beyond 2014, specifically the planned fuel conversions at Portland, Shawville, Avon Lake and New Castle. Following the closing of the new tax equity facility and the fourth quarter drop-down to Yield, the remaining $400 million in excess cash will reside at the NRG level as NRG Yield will use its excess cash to help fund the drop-down. This NRG level excess cash provides a base of support for our growing residential solar business and Midwest Generation investments next year. We'll provide an overview of the 2015 capital allocation in the first quarter.","And with that, I'll turn it back to David.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Kirk, and thank you, Mauricio, as well. Before we open the lines for questions and I think we'll go till 10:00 because I think Duke reports at 10:00 and we don't want you to miss that, I want to turn your attention to Slide 19. As we begin to feel the cold breath of winter here in Central New Jersey, let me give you a sense of where we feel that we are in terms of our performance against our 2014 strategic goals, which we articulated in our first quarterly call last February. Obviously, 2014 remains a work in progress with 2 months remaining until the end of the year and we continue to strive against all of the goals that we articulated. While I won't elaborate on each of the 12, you will see from our self-assessment that we feel that we have been pretty successful. We've achieved meaningful and identifiable advances against each of the 4 strategic pillars of our strategy.","There are only 2 of the 12 areas where we would have liked to have accomplished more and we will endeavor to do more in the months to come, and those areas are utility scale renewables and capital allocations, specifically share buyback.","With respect to utility scale renewables, our relative lack of success in this area has been caused by a relative lack of opportunity as the last couple of years have witnessed an ever-increasing number of wannabe wind and solar developers piling into the big renewables space. These new entrants are making bargain basement bids based on excessively optimistic assumptions on the price track for solar equipment. We continue to look for big renewable deals ourselves, but -- where we can create value because we think that Tom Doyle and NRG Renew are very, very good at this end of the business, but we won't chase deals that may look good upon announcement, but end up destroying shareholder value once implemented. We are confident that this is an area of further value creation for NRG Renew in the years to come. Indeed, we remain very bullish on business-to-business solar, specifically single-customer, multisite opportunities that we can scale up and believe that our platform is well positioned to capture meaningful value in the near to medium term.","With respect to share buybacks, as you know, for a variety of reasons, we have not had the opportunity to buy back shares this year and this being for only the second time in the 11 years that I have worked at NRG. As we look forward to 2015, clearly, we already have committed a significant amount of our available capital to investment opportunities which we believe will create significant shareholder value over time. Equally clearly, a mismatch currently exists between the multiple sources of shareholder value currently embedded within the NRG Group of Companies and the NRG share price, which, as it traditionally has done, continues to move primarily in correlation to volatile, near-term natural gas prices no matter how modest and declining in relevance those short-term swings in gas pricing are to our performance or to our prospects. As we continue to replenish our coffers after taking into account the current program of committed investments, we will revisit share repurchases as part of our capital allocation plan throughout 2015.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator. Shannon?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just in terms of thinking about the 2015 guidance in the light of the volatility and the guidance you had this year after a great first quarter and then the lack of opportunity in Q -- in the summer anyway, what type of extrinsic value assumptions are baked into your 2015 expectations being cognizant of the fact that you guys want to make sure that you don't have to move your numbers around a lot in the future?","David W. Crane","Greg, I may ask Kirk to address that question specifically. But sort of the context in which you asked the question about the guidance, I'm sure that you're frustrated as everyone on the phone should be frustrated with moving the guidance around. We are frustrated as well and it just makes no sense to us, as we look at our performance. I mean, everything that we could control is right on track, yet we've had to change guidance twice this year because of weather: once up because of the winter and once down because of the summer. If we had done nothing, but announced guidance last November, right now, we'd be sitting here at the upper end of our range. So one of the things that we want to look at between now and our Investor Day and hopefully report back to you is if there's a more accurate way that we could look at guidance in terms of doing guidance with sensitivity to weather, so you could track it with your own following of the weather. But having given that slightly off-topic answer, Kirk, you want to answer the extrinsic value aspect?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Sure. The Wholesale component of our 2015 guidance is based upon the forward curves at this time in terms of what we see in our core markets, in particular, in the Northeast and Texas. If anything, I would say that the upper end of that guidance range, specifically on Wholesale, does incorporate, in a way of saying, the bandwidth of the range of guidance does incorporate some extrinsic value allowing for the possibility of volatility in the portfolio. But overall, our guidance range, especially towards the bottom end of the range is simply based on the forward curves and the implied gross margin that we see from those at this point.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then on the Retail side, you're assuming slightly higher range of outcomes in 2015 versus 2014. Is that -- can you give us sort of the puts and takes there? Is that primarily the accretion from the Dominion retail, offset by assumed margin decline in other areas? And are there assumptions about incremental product margins in there as well?","Kirkland B. Andrews","To some degree, yes. But I think overall, the way you summarized at the outset of your question, interpreting the guidance is correct, and that is that the upside includes the contribution from Dominion, which, I think, as I said, on the second quarter call, while we didn't see a whole lot coming from Dominion as we transition the portfolio this year, we saw the upside and then that's reflected in the guidance range, slightly offset by some declines or contraction on the margin side, particularly on the C&I side where I think we've consistently said we don't see compelling margins in that particular business, which is why we're repositioning our approach to C&I more comprehensively as a bundled product offering, not off the back of strictly grid power. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in greater detail at the Investor Day that David alluded to earlier.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Final question and I'm sure you're getting a lot of follow-ons on this. Obviously, the growth rate from '14 to '15 in your Home Solar installation aspiration is quite high. Can you give us a sense of what you think the 3- to 5-year growth rate is? Or are we going to have to wait for the Analyst Day?","David W. Crane","Well, I'm going to ask Kelcy. I don't know how he's going to answer the question, but I would tell you, I mean, in any of these super high-growth industries, that Kelcy is in a better position to answer your question than I am. But even his answer is going to be a guess. But Kelcy, go ahead.","Kelcy Pegler, Jr.","So I would say that we're preparing ourselves to compete at the top tier of the sector. And we see the guidance that our industry gives for growth trajectories of the whole residential solar space and we see ourselves in the top tier of that.","David W. Crane","And we have no reason to disagree with what the other people in the industry are saying?","Kelcy Pegler, Jr.","Correct.","David W. Crane","Yes, I mean, if anything, I would say, as optimistic as they are, they could be bigger. So anyway, it's obviously great. [indiscernible] It's just exceedingly high growth and what we're more focused on, as Kelcy is saying, is make sure that if the growth comes that we can accommodate it without any deterioration of service.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So following up a little bit on Greg's last question on the energy home business, how do you think investors should look at valuing the EBITDA and cash flow properties of the solar business in aggregate? Obviously, it's a little bit different from the conventional thermal business. What are you saying?","David W. Crane","Julien, the first thing I would tell you is that -- answering that single question more than any other reason is why we're having an Investor Day in January so that we can go through it because I'm not sure if it's susceptible to a 30-second answer but, Kirk, go ahead. Give it your best shot.","Kirkland B. Andrews","You can start telling me now. So first of all, from our perspective, as we alluded to, which is part of the reason why we've excluded the negative EBITDA moving forward in our guidance range, it doesn't -- that business, because of the high growth and because of the long-term cash flows, doesn't really lend itself to kind of traditional EBIT to EBITDA--type metrics. And for that reason, we've started to give you a little bit of sense of what the net capital from NRG that's slightly less than $150 million is the expectation off of that lease volume next year. And given we see a pretty robust return, as I alluded to, of greater than 8% off of that residual cash flow stream, I think the rest of the story, which we'll expand upon at the Investor Day, is translating that fully installed cost into a full monetization, if you will. So the way we think about it is monetizing our cost at a premium is the best way to translate value in the near term.","David W. Crane","Julien, if I could just add just one point. I mean, we see one of our big tasks for all of our investors and actually for our business over the next couple of years is to demonstrate what we think is this extraordinary potential synergy between what Kelcy and NRG Home Solar have to offer and what Elizabeth in NRG Retail have -- who to offer it to. So her 3 million customers with its increasingly cost-competitive and attractive idea that people can monetize the solar value of their real estate, we think that's a great combination. And how you all should be thinking about -- how you should be valuing it, that's part of the thing that we want to present to you in January. But we're also aware that we all live in the show-me state. We actually have to demonstrate to you that it actually can be done. So that's what we're really focused on in this area and that's why we've put them both together under NRG Home.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Well, you've certainly whet my palate to hear what you have to say next. Separately, though, could you address briefly the PJM performance scheme as you're thinking about the opportunity to participate both in the transition auctions and in the subsequent 18, 19 auction with the portfolio and especially the GenOn assets? Will they all quantify is basically the question.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Julien, this is Mauricio. Look, I mean, as you appreciate the rules and the guidelines for the capacity performance continue to change, the first draft, as you know, was very prescriptive in terms of who qualify for that market. That have changed and that -- I guess that change we see that positively. The requirements are less. They focus on fuel certainty, and clearly, reliability will be part of the bidding cost for lack of a better term on the auctions. We provided an indication in terms of what could potentially qualify under this capacity performance on the table on the slide where we show by fuel mix, whether coal, nuclear and dual fuel and oil, I believe it's on Slide 11. But again, I mean, I think that's going to -- until we have the final rules, we'll have more certainty in terms of what can qualify and not. I think it's important to say that we are reviewing all the project that we announced in previous calls around GenOn and Edison Mission because of the capacity performance and the expectation of potentially much higher revenue stream from our capacity markets. So that process is underway right now. But until we have final rules, it's really difficult to pinpoint.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wanted to talk about the financing at NYLD of the asset drop-downs. Can you, Kirk, give a little bit of color in terms of what portion of that purchase price will be financed with debt relative to equity?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Well, as I said, we're going to use the NRG Yield revolver capacity to supplement the cash on hand as we move forward. And as you run the math on what I had laid out there, that's sort of, rough order of magnitude, roughly $200 million relative to a little over $400 million in capacity on the revolver. And as I characterized, that's a temporary draw, which we'd look to repay with the proceeds from financing. Given the fact right now, though, that I'm not going to be specifically predictive about exactly what form of financing we'd take, that'll depend upon the profile of the portfolio at that time. But right now, as we talked about before off the back of the Alta Wind transaction and putting in place the holdco unsecured debt, we are basically on par with our balance sheet targets there. So the extent to which we had capacity in those balance sheet targets, we'd supplement with debt. If not, we'd be biased towards the equity side and we'll make that determination next year.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And secondly, I want to follow up on Julien's question on PJM and kind of the flip side of it that, as you see the penalty language as it now stands, when you assess your portfolio, do you think there's probability of some of your assets more prudently being shut down to avoid penalties? Do think that is the very low probability situation, i.e., you're very confident that all of your plans, risk-adjusted, should stay online and be able to withstand the penalties? Just curious how you think about the penalty side of things.","Mauricio Gutierrez","So Steve, I mean, 2 -- I guess 2 dimensions on that. First one is the field certainty. And if you look at the information that we provided on the table, most of our portfolio, as long as coal, nuclear or some sort of dual-fuel capability, we feel comfortable we're bidding those assets in the capacity performance. The second one is the penalties. And if there is one concern that we have on the existing rule is, I guess, the relative size of the penalty compared to the revenue and we've provided those comments to PJM. But ultimately, depending on the expectation of reliability of these assets, that will be priced into the bids that we're submitting to the auction. So to the extent that we have an asset that is unreliable, I think that's going to be factored in. And if the market doesn't need that asset, then it won't clear. I mean, I think it's as straightforward as that.","Christopher S. Moser","Steve, this is Chris. Just to echo what Mauricio was just saying, too. I mean the penalties are definitely stiff at 1.5x net CONE, but the current suggestion is that the offer cap is going to be net CONE, which is a heck of a lot more space than we have today. So I would think that we'd be able to price in a lot of that risk and then we'll see where the market clears.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I actually wanted to ask additional questions about this capacity -- the new capacity product. So how should we think about it? So you're showing us growing Retail and growing margins while you expect higher and probably more volatile energy prices and higher capacity prices. So how does -- how do you reconcile these 2? Do you basically assume that you price in the higher payments or how about the contracts that have already been signed?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, I mean I'll let Elizabeth talk about the Retail. But I think, in general terms, the changes on the capacity performance market will be a net positive to our Wholesale portfolio. In terms of Retail, particularly in the Northeast, it's heavily weighted towards the mass residential market. That tends to be very short term in nature. So any potential market changes from the capacity performance will start happening in 2016 and beyond. And that's well within the period where you can actually price it in, but Elizabeth, I don't know if there's anything else there?","Elizabeth Killinger","Mauricio, you covered it. We benefit from our integrated model -- in our wholesale\/retail integrated model, in circumstances like this and we feel comfortable that we can manage any risk associated with that.","Christopher S. Moser","And Angie, this is Chris again. Don't forget that just the sheer size of the comparison of the portfolios, I mean, if we're serving 12-some thousand megawatts in Texas and we got 11.5 or so thousand megawatts down there, that's pretty well balanced. When you get to the Northeast, we are preponderantly long generation there, 17,000 megawatts in PJM alone, not counting New York and New England. And the load that we serve up there is a fraction. So really, if capacity goes up, we're a multiple winner just from the sheer leverage of that.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Now, I mean, talking about the potential upside, I mean, if you're truly -- if you truly have 15 gigawatts of capacity that's eligible and looking at the sensitivity scenarios that PJM is showing, I mean, we're talking about $400 million-plus of potential upside in earnings. I mean, my question is that does that look a little bit too good to be true and I know I'm not accounting for the penalty side here. But I mean, what type of a response and how sustainable do you think that, that level of earnings stream is actually starting in '18 and beyond when that definitely also lines up the pockets of potential new-build projects? How do you think that this pickup that you could see in incremental auctions is sustainable going forward?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, Angie. Well, a couple of things. Number one, I don't think we need to wait until 2018 to see some of the impact on the capacity performance. As you know, there will be a transition period. Hard to think that the 15, 16, I think, is going to be more a target megawatts, always going to have some upside and then there's going to be some sort of pro rata for the 2 auctions that are already clear. So the impact is going to be felt before that. In terms of the size and the magnitude of that, I mean, it is really hard to pinpoint from this point, and yes, I mean, the rules continue to change. There was yesterday an open meeting with PJM in terms of getting comments back from stakeholders. Clearly, we think it's not a small change in our revenue expectation. I think it is rather large. So far, I guess, we have the quantity in terms of the number of assets that could potentially qualify under the capacity performance. We don't know the price. We don't know the bidding behavior. I already said that it is a significant change in terms of what are the items that can be now priced into your bids. And ultimately, I guess, the price will work itself out when we go through the auctions. But I think it's important to say that the impact is pretty significant for us. We think that our portfolio is well positioned. And when we get the right pricing, then we'll be in a better position to tell you that. Now keep in mind that this capacity performance also is going to attract new builds and it's just a -- I mean, at this point, we will be speculating on the absolute impact on our portfolio.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","And then my last question here would be, would you consider bringing back some of your coal plants that are either already shut down or actually slated for retirements in PJM?","David W. Crane","Angie, I mean, the plants that aren't operating, I mean, some are mothballed, some go into full retirement. Once they go into full retirement, you can't bring them back. But I mean, I'd say, in general terms, obviously we're continuously looking at the circumstances that exist and if we can create value by bring plants back or bringing them back on a seasonal basis, we've been doing that in Texas for a few years. We'd do that in the Northeast to the extent that we can. I mean, to me, that is one of the premier competitive advantages we have on the Wholesale generation side. We have such a large and varied portfolio that we can find where the value is and get after it. So we'll be constantly looking at that.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Fremont of Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess being a fan of the Texas market is a lot like being a Mets fan. It always comes down to wait until next year. What seems to be changing in your opinion, given sort your new-build announcement, Calpine new build and Exelon new-build announcements there?","David W. Crane","Well, that's sort of a loaded question. I come from the north side of Chicago where to be a Cubs fan makes being a Mets fan look like being an optimist. But I mean, look, I think Texas, I mean, you've sort of mentioned it. I mean I would say that the new build that we're talking about today at Robinson at $400 installed capacity. It's a brownfield site with equipment obtained in the secondary market. I mean, not too many people can do that. So I'm not sure that what we've seen is a huge flood of new supply unleashed yet, so we have reason to be optimistic in the short to medium term because Texas does grow. It usually is affected by extreme weather in the summer and occasionally in the winter. So I mean we like the Texas market. But you do point to the fact that it's hard to have a sustained advantage in the Texas market on the Wholesale side for years and years because the barriers to entry in terms of new build are low in Texas. And they've always been low. And that's where I think that the premiere advantage that we have over others is the combined wholesale retail model. Because when prices are subdued on the wholesale side, Elizabeth does well. So overall, it's a good market, but you're right, I mean, Texas will never be in a multi-year scarcity of generation situation because you can build quickly there.","Paul B. Fremont - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then my other question is, I mean, it seems like your outlook on the core generation business seems a lot more optimistic on this call than it did on the last call. What accounts for that?","David W. Crane","Well, what accounts for that was that I wasn't clear enough on the last call in terms of what sort of time frame that we were talking about. On the last call when I was talking about how we were going to reorganize the business -- I was talking about how we were going to reorganize the business and I sort of forgot 2 words, for the \"long term.\" I mean, short- to medium-term, I'm quite optimistic if you look at -- I mean, not every regional market. One of the things that's been going on, on the wholesale generation side is it's very difficult to talk in broad-brush terms about all the markets as if they're the same. The Gulf Coast, the East Coast and the West Coast, they all have completely different dynamics, which is a big change in our industry from when I got going in this industry 15 years ago. So you'd almost have to go region by region, but my fundamental view on the outlook for our Wholesale portfolio short- to medium-term, has not changed between this call and the previous call. It's just I wasn't talking about the short- to medium-term on the last call and you and many other people didn't hear me sort of distinguish that and that was my fault and I'm going to try and be much clearer in the future. So I'm properly chastised.","So Paul, we've got to move on. We know -- we don't want to run into, conflicting with the Duke call, so we have like one more -- we'll take one more caller, and I apologize to the callers who did not get on. But Chad and the team would be happy to follow up and if you need to get Mauricio and Kirk and myself involved in the answers, we'll get involved as well because we want to answer everyone's questions, but for now, Operator Shannon, can we take 1 more call?","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just a question on the NRG Yield side on the expansion of some of these California projects, et cetera. And I think you said you now have a growth backlog through at least the end of the decade per mid-teens. Could you just give a little more flavor on the YieldCo-eligible cash flows that you now have for NRG Yield?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Sure, Steve, it's Kirk. And I think that David's remarks about enabling us to sustain that double-digit growth into the next decade, we're clearly focused on that and we're optimistic about the potential contributions to enable that specifically from the projects that were announced around SCE. Although we're not at a point now that we're going to provide specific guidance in terms of what the CAFD and the economics. We're early days. Obviously, we have to go through the CPUC approval process and the like. But the guidance I give you, if you look at the megawatts of those different projects, with the exception for Preferred Resources, a little bit of a different profile there. But as far as the Mandalay and also the Carlsbad projects, roughly 265 megawatts and 600 megawatts, respectively, a good proxy for at least the EBITDA contributions of those is off the back of the existing projects that are down there where I think Marsh Landing, El Segundo, rough order of magnitude, kind of EBITDA per megawatt. Roughly kind of 15% of megawatts translates into EBITDA and that's probably a good proxy for how to think about the contributions from those plants.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","And then also with respect to NRG Yield in the scheme of the new NRG Home Solar businesses, could you give a little bit of flavor on how they will likely participate?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Only as to say, as I've alluded to in the past, that we're focused on, as I said on this call also, monetizing the remainder of that capital and the residual cash flow stream after-tax equity. There are a number of different options available and we're evaluating all of those. But specifically for NRG Yield, we think the potential is very great for NRG Yield to play a part in that monetization, both from the standpoint of highlighting the value in the near term, as I alluded to before, and also given the return profile that the cash flows, the duration there, 20 years long-term contract, I think it has a lot of the elements that are very consistent with the NRG Yield portfolio. So I would say at this point it has high potential and more to come as we move into '15.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Steven. And Shannon, I think we have to conclude here. And I appreciate everyone taking the time. And like I said, we'll follow up with whoever couldn't get on the call. So thank you, and we'll look forward to seeing you in January. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."],"16372":["NRG Energy, Inc.

Welcome to the NRG Energy, Inc. Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management\u2019s prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded for replay purposes.","It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Kevin Cole","Thank you, Brian. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is scheduled for 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts.","Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings.

For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I\u2019m joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","I would like to start the call with our key messages on the Slide 3 that highlights the simplicity of our value proposition and demonstrate the predictability of our platform, particularly after the summer we experienced in Texas with significant weather and price volatility.","First, our integrated platform performed well during the summer, allowing us to narrow our 2019 guidance around the midpoint of our range, and validating again the resilience of our business. Second, we\u2019re initiating 2020 guidance that further demonstrates our ability to deliver robust and predictable results through varying market conditions. And third, we\u2019re providing additional clarity on our capital allocation philosophy, given the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves.","We are introducing a framework consistent with our goal of growing and perfecting our business, while returning meaningful capital for shareholders. These framework targets 50% of excess capital towards growth and 50% to be returned to shareholders, supported now by a more significant dividend policy.","So moving to our third quarter results on \u2013 highlights on Slide 4. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the quarter, we remained a top decile safety performance and delivered $792 million of adjusted EBITDA, or 33% higher than last year on a same-store basis. This was primarily driven by higher realized power prices, margin enhancement, and retail customer growth, partially offset by higher retail supply costs and higher unplanned outages.","In the summer in Texas was particularly challenging, given the extreme weather and price volatility that resulted in record prices and record demand. I\u2019m very proud of our generation and retail teams for their ability to deliver a strong financial performance during a period of extreme price volatility. It is exactly in this price environment that our platform demonstrate the benefits of the integrated model.","Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results now stand up $1.6 billion, a 19% increase from last year, allowing us to narrow our 2019 guidance range around the midpoint to $1.9 billion to $2 billion.","During the quarter, we continue to execute on our capital-light strategy, signing an additional 100 megawatts of solar PPAs, bringing the total to 1.4 gigawatts this year. While we continue to pursue additional solar PPAs, which allows us to better serve our customers and further balance our integrated platform. Also, during the quarter, we completed $55 million of our current $250 million share repurchase program, leaving $195 million to be completed over the balance of the year.","Moving to the right side of this slide, we\u2019re initiating 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and free cash flow before growth guidance of $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion. This guidance further demonstrates our ability to deliver stable and predictable results through varying market conditions. Kirk will provide additional details on both guidance ranges later in the call.","Finally, as part of the long-term capital allocation policy that I will discuss in more detail later in the presentation, I\u2019m pleased to announce that beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we will increase our annual dividend from $0.12 per share to $1.20 per share, or about 3% yield, with a target annual growth rate of 7% to 9%.","Now turning to Slide 5 for a closer look at the summer in Texas. On the top left chart, we show weather represented a cooling degree days by month. As you can see, summer weather was mixed. Mild temperatures are early in the summer, with warmer weather in August and September, presented unique challenges for the power grid. This resulted in power prices significantly different from their forward indications.","As you can see in the lower chart, July prices came in below forecast, while August and September came in significantly above, driven primarily by warmer weather, coupled with lower than expected wind generation and increased unplanned outages.","Like the rest of the market, we also experienced some increased unplanned outages. The most notable one being WA Parish unit 6, after running reliably for over 200 consecutive days. The cost of the outage was a one-off and we do not expect to see a repeat in the future, as the circumstances were specific to that unit. However, the unit meets most of August and September, limiting our ability to benefit from higher prices.","Now turning to the right side of the slide, our integrated platform provided stable results through July\u2019s low load, low price and August and September\u2019s high load, high price environments. Underpinning our success was strong supply and risk management, enhanced customer outreach, and build management tools provided to residential and commercial customers.","Now between the summer of 2018, with volatile forwards and disappointing real-time prices, and the summer of 2019 with almost the opposite higher real-time prices, we have now demonstrated the strength and predictability of our integrated model through two very different market conditions. This is one more example of what underpins our confidence in the stability and predictability of our business.","Now, as we entered 2020 with limited calls on our capital, I want to take a moment to review our capital location track record on Slide 6, particularly in light of the financial flexibility we have created for ourselves. As you recall, we have outlined three distinct phases on our transformation.","First, in 2016 and 2017, we focus on stabilizing the business through selling or closing underperforming assets, focusing on our core integrated business and strengthening our balance sheet. If you recall, my first commitment to you nearly four years ago, was to leave no doubt in our balance sheet strength, and that is where we committed our excess cash. We allocated 70% of excess cash during this period to debt repayment and 20% to resolve legacy commitments.","Next, in 2018, we entered Phase 2 with a focus on right-sizing the portfolio to better integrate and align generation with retail. During this period, we executed over $3 billion in asset sales, which reduced our generation portfolio by 50% and strengthened our balance sheet to investment-grade credit metrics, creating tremendous financial flexibility.","And with this financial flexibility, we completed two accretive mid-sized retail transactions by allocating 18% of our excess cash and took advantage of our dislocated stock price by allocating nearly 50% towards returning capital to shareholders and reducing our share count by over 20%.","Now as we move into our next phase of redefining our business and with significant financial flexibility, I want to provide additional clarity and refinement into our long-term capital principles and priorities.","As you can see on the right-hand side, our commitment to safety, operational excellence and balance sheet remains unchanged. Our enhancement today will focus on growing our business and returning capital to shareholders. Like I have said in past calls, I believe a predictable cash flow company like ours, should regularly and meaningfully return capital to shareholders. It creates discipline and it is part of our overall value proposition.","Let me further unpack these on Slide 7. Starting on the left-hand side, you can see our updated capital allocation framework waterfall. We have come a long way in achieving our goals. We continue to maintain top decile safety and operational excellence and have achieved what we believe to be investment-grade credit metrics.","Today, we are establishing a target allocation mix of 50% to our traded growth investments and 50% to return of capital. For those listening that are new to the NRG story, prior to today, returning capital to shareholders was primarily viewed through the lens of unallocated growth capital, which is no longer the case. I believe a long-term commitment through a strong dividend policy, complemented by share repurchases, is an important attribute for both value creation and broadening our shareholder base.","First, on growth. As you can see on the waterfall, there is no change in our investment criteria. These capital will either be deployed in good, sound investments that meet our financial thresholds and are consistent with our strategy or they will be returned back to our shareholders.","Next, on return of capital. We are increasing our annual dividend from $0.12 to $1.20 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and targeting a 7% to 9% annual growth rate. While I continue to see our stock as one of the most compelling investment opportunities, I also believe a more significant dividend policy, provides added visibility in returning capital to shareholders and helps broaden our investor base, as we continue to execute and validate the stability and predictability of cash flows. We will also complement the dividend with significant and programmatic share repurchases.","On the right side of this slide, we want to illustrate the magnitude of the excess cash and the impact of our refined capital allocation policy. If we simply maintain the existing earnings power of our business, while deploying 50% of our excess cash at the midpoint of our hurdle rate, and the remaining 50% of excess cash used to grow the dividend and for share purchases, you can see in this scenario that over the next five years, we would generate over $8 billion of excess cash, or 80% of our market cap, grow our annual free cash flow before growth by 50% and shrink our share count by 30%.","We are an increasingly stable and predictable cash flow company that through the combination of compelling growth investments and share repurchases are on track to double our free cash flow per share over the next five years, while paying a compelling and affordable dividend with 7% to 9% annual growth.","So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 9, NRG delivered $792 million in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter and $433 million in free cash flow before growth. This brings total adjusted EBITDA through the first nine months to around $1.6 billion, with $637 million in free cash flow.","After adjusting for a $57 million reduction in EBITDA for asset sales and deconsolidations in 2018, our third quarter results were $198 million higher than 2018, driven by generation, which benefited from higher realized power prices in Texas and lower costs from transformation plan savings.","These elements were partially offset by lower capacity revenues and generation volumes in the East and the West, while retail remained flat for the quarter with higher supply costs and milder weather at the beginning of the quarter, offsetting our margin enhancement initiatives and contributions from acquisitions.","The bulk of the third quarter retail load and EBITDA was generated during the back-half of third quarter, resulting in higher working capital, driven by receivables. As a result of a greater portion of the cash flow associated with third quarter retail EBITDA, that cash flow will be realized during the fourth quarter as the receivable balance unwinds, and we\u2019ve already begun to see this significant cash flow materialized over the month of October. With these results to date, we\u2019re narrowing our 2019 EBITDA guidance range to $1.9 to $2 billion in EBITDA.","As I alluded to last quarter, higher power prices in ERCOT have driven higher realized and expected EBITDA for the Generation segment, while the corresponding higher cost drives lower expected EBITDA for Retail. These elements are reflected in the revised segment components of our narrowed consolidated guidance, which nonetheless remain centered around our original midpoint.","While midpoint EBITDA guidance remains unchanged, our revised 2019 free cash flow guidance midpoint is lowered by $50 million, due to the cash flow impact from outages during 2019, including WA Parish. Although, the EBITDA impact of these outages was offset by other items, our free cash flow outlook is slightly lower, primarily due to increases in maintenance CapEx, resulting from the outages.","During the third quarter, we finalized the contractually required one-time leverage test for our Petra Nova project. Although, as I indicated on our previous earnings call, NRG\u2019s obligation could have been up to $124 million, we were able to keep the amount required from NRG to only $107 million. We satisfied this obligation in two parts.","First, $95 million of cash was contributed by NRG to the project in the third quarter; and second, NRG posted a $12 million letter of credit, which may be drawn by the project at a future date. Having now satisfied our legacy obligation under the leverage test, the guarantee supporting this obligation is now eliminated and the remaining debt at the project is non-recourse to NRG.","Finally, since the announcement in August of our $250 million share repurchase program, we\u2019ve completed $55 million in additional share purchases at an average of $37.62 a share. We expect to complete the remaining $195 million of repurchases under that program over the balance of the year.","Turning to Slide 10, you\u2019ll find our newly announced guidance ranges for 2020. Specifically, we expect $1.9 billion to $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA for 2020. As shown in the table on the right-hand side of the slide, based on the midpoint of our guidance ranges, this implies about $50 million of year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA, driven by the final component of our margin enhancement program, or $80 million and the full contribution from the Stream acquisition. These are partially offset by higher year-over-year retail costs.","We expect $1.275 billion to $1.375 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2020, converting approximately $0.70 of EBITDA into cash. Our 2020 guidance ranges exclude any EBITDA or free cash flow associated with Agua Caliente, as we are targeting the sale of our remaining stake in that project during 2020.","Turning to Slide 11 for a brief update on 2019 capital allocation. Changes since the prior quarter are highlighted in blue include a slight adjustments to total capital to reflect the midpoint of our revised free cash flow guidance. Growth investments now reflect $95 million in cash contributed to Petra Nova, as well as a small increase associated with the purchase of retail books.","As a result, we have about $80 million of 2019 excess capital remaining to be allocated, which we\u2019d expect to allocate using the newly announced guideline Mauricio outlined earlier, or approximately 50% for growth and 50% to share repurchases.","Finally, as I mentioned during my review of third quarter results, we\u2019ve seen significant positive cash flow since the end of the quarter. In order to show this more clearly, on the upper right of the slide, I\u2019ve included a liquidity table to show the significant change in liquidity, which is the sum of cash and credit facility availability as of November 1, as compared to the quarter-end.","Over the month of October, our liquidity improved by over $450 million. Net of the non-cash reduction in letters of credit posted over 50% of this improvement in liquidity represents free cash flow before growth during the month of October.","And finally, turning to Slide 12. The midpoint of our newly announced 2020 guidance range places us on track to achieve the low-end of our target investment-grade metrics for about 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA, making 2020 the second year of investment-grade metrics for NRG.","We continue to believe that these consistent and strong credit metrics, combined with a continued execution and an active dialogue with ratings agencies, places us in a position to earn an investment-grade rating in the next 12 to 18 months.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Kirk. Turning to Slide 14, I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2019 priorities and expectations. Our top priority for sometime has been to demonstrate the predictability and stability of our integrated platform. And this summer marks another year of delivering stable earnings through volatile market conditions.","As you can see on our scorecard, we\u2019ve made significant progress across all other priorities from perfecting our business and reducing debt to delivering on our transformation goals. We will continue to simplify our disclosures to help better understand the value proposition of our integrated platform going forward.","As we move into 2020, I\u2019m confident our platform, coupled with clear and compelling capital allocation principles, is well positioned to deliver strong and predictable results and create significant shareholder value.","So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Brian, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, team. Congratulations.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Julien. Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, so perhaps first off, I\u2019m curious on the new growth strategy, if you could elaborate a little bit. How do you think about the finding investments that achieved those hurdle rates? And how do you think about sort of over time contrast and that against your own levered and unlevered yield as it stands today?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. Well, I don\u2019t think there is a new growth strategy. I think what we\u2019re doing here is to provide more clarity on the return of capital policy that we have long-term. In terms of growth, I don\u2019t think anything has changed from my perspective. In the near-term, I continue to see opportunities in the \u2013 primarily in the retail space.","I will say, small to medium-sized companies similar to what we executed in the past year-and-a-half with XOOM and Stream. And the number of those opportunities are still limited, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to focus in the near-term. I mean, medium and long-term, we will see where these opportunities are.","I mean, as we continue to perfect our model, obviously, we\u2019re looking at, how do we enhance the products and services that we provide to our customers. But I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a new growth strategy. It\u2019s just providing more clarity on our return of capital to shareholders.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","But are there still opportunities to acquire retail platforms at this point, given just the consolidation we\u2019ve already seen? And then maybe I\u2019ll ask at the same time, the 7% and 9% dividend growth, that\u2019s basically predicated on not just the repo, but also finding these platforms and deploying capital allocation?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. So I mean, we still see some opportunities. I mean, where, as you mentioned, I mean, there is some \u2013 there\u2019s a pretty fair activity in terms of our consolidation in the retail space. We\u2019re evaluating what will be complementary to our business in terms of products, regions, channels, just like we did with XOOM and Stream, which gets us into the referral sales channel.","We\u2019re evaluating what else, where are these other opportunities that can complement and enhance and grow our our retail business, but that\u2019s where I see right now the most immediate opportunities. Obviously, we\u2019re still executing on our capitalized strategy to continue perfecting and balancing our portfolio. But, as I said, I mean, that\u2019s capital, right?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Absolutely. Okay. Thank you very much, guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning. How are you?","Greg Gordon","I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good. So I guess, just to follow-up on Julien\u2019s point. I mean, you are reiterating a pretty high hurdle rate for growth capital investments. And it would seem to me that the depth of the market for either assets or businesses that have those type of returns could be pretty shallow. So you\u2019re committed, if you can\u2019t deploy that capital in any given year to pivoting to buybacks with that money? I mean, I know you \u2013 if you just talk through your thought process on that and how you\u2019ll communicate that going forward?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, the long-term capital return \u2013 the return of capital policy that we\u2019re providing today does have some flexibility embedded in it, I mean, if we cannot find growth opportunities that meet our financial thresholds. And importantly, that is superior to buying back our own stock, then we\u2019ll return that capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks.","So that\u2019s where the flexibility is embedded in our plan. But again, what I wanted \u2013 the goal of today is to provide more clarity in terms of what is that return of capital philosophy that supports the value proposition of NRG. Greg, as I said in the past, I mean, the value proposition of the company it is to have a business model that is balanced, that provides the stable and predictable earnings with an investment-grade type of balance sheet and a very clear and transparent capital allocation principles.","And part of those principles is to returning a meaningful part of our excess cash to shareholders. What we are doing today is providing that clarity in terms of what is meaningful. And what I\u2019m saying today is $0.50 of every dollar of excess cash will go to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and 50% will go to growth. But if we cannot find growth opportunities that meet the threshold that I just said, then we\u2019ll return that capital for shareholders.","Greg Gordon","Great. Are there any \u2013 is there any type of investment that\u2019s \u2013 that you would say is sort of off limits? Like are you not interested in more power generation, or in the right markets, if you have the right retail load \u2013 mix is our power generation assets potentially part of the capital deployment scenario?","Mauricio Gutierrez","I mean, at this point, we\u2019re being very successful with our capital-light strategy on the generation side. Given where we\u2019re seeing the economics. I don\u2019t see immediately opportunities in generation. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re creating optionality within our portfolio. I mean, we have a lot of assets. We have a lot of power plants across our fleet. But I don\u2019t see that today. I mean, I think the most immediate actionable opportunities are within the retail space.","Greg Gordon","All right. Thanks. One last question. When I look at the hedges, I see that you\u2019ve rolled the hedges forward to 2021, and it looks like you\u2019ve got some pretty good marks in there. You also mentioned that you\u2019re going to continue, however, to evolve your disclosures. Can you maybe give us a little bit more on where you think you\u2019re heading there? So few questions, sorry.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, when I think about the business, I don\u2019t think about it two different businesses, I mean, generation and retail. I actually think about it as an integrated platform. So one of the improvements that we\u2019re going to do on the disclosures is, how do we think about that integrated platform. I think we\u2019ve been very good at providing disclosures on the generation side of the business, but now we have to do a better job in providing them holistically for the integrated model as a whole.","Greg Gordon","Great. And Kirk, can you comment on the hedge position? It looks like you have some pretty good marks there?","Kirkland Andrews","Yes. I mean, I think we\u2019ve taken advantage of some higher prices, as we always have at the end of the day, that\u2019s obviously improved our position. But we\u2019re mindful of the fact that, the balance of that whether we hedge or whether we remain open, that obviously provides a backdrop or support for the retail supply, especially around ERCOT. But yes, certainly a product of well-timed hedging taking advantage of rally and market prices beyond the prop here, certainly.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Fleishman","Yes. Hi, good morning. So maybe\u2026","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Fleishman","Hey, Mauricio. So maybe just a little more color on, obviously, retail has been hurt by the supply cost and the like. But just how\u2019s retail performing, both in terms of the traditional ERCOT business, customer count, things like that? And also, how would you characterize how the acquisitions have gone so far in retail?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, Steve. Well, let me turn it to Elizabeth.","Elizabeth Killinger","So first, I\u2019ll start with the acquisitions. We are very pleased with both the XOOM and Stream acquisitions. They have integrated very seamlessly into our organization. And in XOOM\u2019s case has set records in selling once it was under our ownership and Stream is integrating well. They\u2019re both culturally and from a team and business process perspective, that\u2019s going very well.","We do have some noise in our customer account inter quarter, really because of the acquisitions from the small book transactions, which includes expected early attrition. And so we will \u2013 we \u2013 that\u2019s part of our valuation model. And overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the strength and the performance of our acquisition and retention engine.","In light of some customer price pressure \u2013 or bill shock pressure that customers have experienced. So we\u2019ll continue to run this business and balance both EBITDA and customer account with an eye towards long-term growth, which we have demonstrated year in and year out, both on earnings and customer count.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then just at a high level, I mean, just to try and simplify, what you\u2019re seeing in the mix here is just the supply cost retail going up because of higher ERCOT prices and you are capturing that essentially in generation with better numbers 2019, 2020 than you might have initially expected\u2026","Mauricio Gutierrez","That\u2019s correct.","Steven Fleishman","Is that\u2026?","Mauricio Gutierrez","\u2026that\u2019s absolutely correct, Steve. I mean, this is a complementary and countercyclical nature of these two businesses. But as I said in the past, I mean, I\u2019m focused on total gross margin for the company. Let\u2019s focus on the segments and making sure that that top \u2013 that gross margin is just stable and predictable regardless of market conditions.","Steven Fleishman","And then just lastly, on the PPA strategy, I saw you added a little bit more in Texas. Just what \u2013 where should we maybe see that going over the next year or so? How much more do you want to do?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. Well, I mean, as you noted, I mean, we only executed 100 megawatts this quarter. And I think that is an indication of the slowdown that we\u2019re seeing on solar development. We\u2019re just not seeing the attractiveness on the solar PPA that we saw initially. I mean, there has been an increase in cost for some of the solar developers, tariffs.","So I think that\u2019s having a very active strategy like this just gives us a lot of visibility in terms of the speed at which solar development is happening and what I\u2019m telling you is slowing down a little bit. In terms of how much more from the 1.4, the governing number here is the size of our retail business.","So if you look at our retail business big long versus our generation, I would feel comfortable if we execute that\u2019s close to 2 to 2.5 gigs, but obviously, that\u2019s going to depend on the economics that we can achieve on the PPAs. So, what I think, that\u2019s a good observation, Steve.","Steven Fleishman","Is it just less \u2013 you\u2019re not seeing kind of some of the irrational price offers, I guess, that might have been there before in terms of \u2026?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, I think, some of the offers that we saw earlier, we don\u2019t see it anymore, and I think it\u2019s a function of two things. One, I mean, keep in mind that the counterparty that we\u2019re talking about are pretty high-quality counterparties, because we can provide them a \u2013 an average of 10-year contract with balance sheet that is investment grade.","So we actually enable them and put them at a higher competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis other developers. But I think it\u2019s also impacted by perhaps higher costs due to tariffs that have been imposed.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez","You\u2019re welcome, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Will Grainger with Citi. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta","Hi. This is actually Praful from Citi. So on the EBITDA profile that you provided over the longer-term, as you think about your capital allocation, just wanted to understand you think about any degradation of EBITDA in that profile, especially if there\u2019s any replacement needed for existing assets that \u2013 existing generation assets that need to be replaced. How do you think about that in that mix?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. No, good morning, Praful. So the way I think about it is, perhaps we need to do it on a regional basis. In Texas, I feel very stable, because we have pretty well balanced portfolio between generation and retail. So, whether you have a contango or a backward-dated curve, your retail margins can expand, while your generation contracts on the other way around. So I see that very stable in Texas for the foreseeable future.","The East, this is slightly different, because our generation continues to be bigger than our retail and is primarily driven by capacity prices. The good thing in the East is that, we know exactly what it is in the next three years. So, we have good, I mean, everybody has good visibility on that. Beyond that is going to depend on what happens with FERC and the actions that they take around the out-of-market subsidies for nuclear resources. And that\u2019s really going to depend on that regulatory outcome.","What I will say is that, we have actually seen a, let\u2019s call it, a nicer price in California. Capacity prices have increased significantly. So, while we have seen some pressure in capacity in the East, we actually have seen some gains in the West that have balanced each other out.","So I would say that \u2013 I just feel very comfortable with the guidance that we have provided for 2020 as a base to do the calculations. And obviously, what we provided was illustrative, but I feel very, very comfortable with that.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. That\u2019s super helpful context. Then in terms of what you said on the growth CapEx and retail, giving you\u2019re a pretty balanced, as you said, in the Texas market already, should we think about the incremental retail that you\u2019re looking to acquire in the near-term to be in different markets other than Texas, or how should we think about that?","Mauricio Gutierrez","No, I think it will be both. I mean, obviously, I want to grow the East to better balance. But I will say that, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re not growing in Texas. I mean, we have a pretty commanding lead, I mean, a little over 30% of market share. So, I mean, there\u2019s still \u2013 if we can grow Texas, I mean, think about Texas in the context of, there is organic growth in Texas as a whole. The market is growing 2%. So, we can grow with the market.","And then number two, if we can add additional market share from competitors, either through organic initiatives or inorganic acquisitions. I mean, we\u2019re going to do that. But that is value for me regardless of where the region. And then on the rebalancing side in Texas, I mean, we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage of these new technologies that are coming into the market and I mean, we\u2019re doing it at very attractive levels. We\u2019re participating on that and. And all this does is just lower our cost of serving load So yes, I\u2019m good with them.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. Super helpful. Then just finally, in terms of like the breadth of retail, would you look at distributed generation or some of those types of assets as well as part of your broadened retail mix, or are you kind of going to stay more focused in terms of what you acquire?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, if your question on distributed generation is something like residential solar. No, I\u2019m not. I think we have been there, we have done that. We\u2019re focused on continuing to establish a much closer relationship with our customers creating more loyalty and infinity, providing more products and services. But we don\u2019t have to vertically integrate every single product that we offer to our customers.","I mean, I\u2019m okay partnering. And actually, today, we offer residential solar. We just offer it through partners. And what is important to me is that, we maintain the relationship with a customer, that we give them best-in-class interface to all the products and services that we provide, whether we do them all in-house or not. And in the case of some of the distributed resources, I\u2019d rather partner than vertically integrate.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. Super helpful, Mauricio. Thanks so much.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. First question, for you, Kirk. As you unveil your higher or more aggressive dividend policy, wondering if you\u2019ve had discussions with the rating agencies. Does it have any implications on their thinking regarding investment-grade? And just from a priority point of view, where does investment-grade or achieving that fit in versus capital allocation, et cetera?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Kirk?","Kirkland Andrews","Well, I mean, first of all, it\u2019s Kirk. We\u2019ve obviously allocated the capital necessary to achieve the metrics, both in 2019 and sustain them into 2020. So from a capital allocation perspective, we feel very comfortable that we put our money, where our metrics need to be in are, if you will.","As far as the dividend is concerned, we \u2013 based on our ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies, I think, certainly, they\u2019re very focused on capital allocation. Our first priority, which we say to you and say to them, notwithstanding the fact we don\u2019t perceive the need for capital. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that our priority goes first to maintain those balance sheet metrics. That\u2019s a very important part of the dialogue, both with our investors as well as the agencies.","And we feel comfortable that the dividend commitment is right-sized relative to our confidence in the overall magnitude of free cash flow, still affording us a lot of financial flexibility around that. And because the chart Mauricio showed, depicts the combination or the benefit of ongoing share repurchases to a significant degree, i.e. shrinking the denominator, keeps us from needing to grow the overall dividend at the same magnitude as the growth on a per share basis.","So that also keeps the capital necessary for that very manageable. So I think all that factors in both to our thinking about the dividend, as well as the dialogue we have with the rating agencies around that topic.","Ali Agha","Gotcha. And then secondly, coming back to the \u2013 this integrated model. So, as you depict to us on Slide 21, at least on the wholesale side, you\u2019re seeing this \u2013 currently, this downward trend, 2021 over 2020. When you think about the retail business, how much of that roughly do you think is offset? And on an integrated basis just big picture-wise, how does 2021 today look to you relative to 2020?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I would say pretty flat. I mean, we have the ability to expand margins on that environment. So when I say that is complementary and countercyclical, I mean, if there is a \u2013 if there is some backwardation in the curve and that\u2019s putting some pressure on generation. I expect retail to expand those margins.","And keep in mind that we\u2019re also, in 2021, we\u2019re going to start seeing the benefits of the PPAs that we have also signed. So they tend to be somewhat very attractive compared to market. So all it does is, we\u2019re serving low at a lower cost of goods sold for a lack of a better word.","Now, like I said, I mean, you also have to look at the East is slightly different, right? Like I said, I mean, it\u2019s driven primarily by capacity revenues. But we provide very clear visibility in terms of what those capacity revenues are for the next three years. They\u2019re locked in, so there\u2019s no surprises. And we can adjust our maintenance programs. We can adjust our cost structure depending on what the earnings profile of those assets in these would be.","So I mean, that\u2019s a lever that you perhaps actually that you don\u2019t see in these one dimensional sensitivity that we provide, is what else can we do around the cost structure of the company to ensure that we maintain competitiveness in our fleet.","Ali Agha","Gotcha. And final question, which \u2013 one of your peer companies talked about this concept of retail backwardation, where they\u2019re seeing negative margins in the first couple of years turning to positive as they sign fixed price longer-term contracts. Just curious, are you seeing any of that in your portfolio in your markets?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, everything that we do, I mean, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about commercial and industrial long-term transaction? Is that what you\u2019re talking about?","Ali Agha","Yes.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. So I mean, I guess a couple of things. Number one, when we do any C&I transaction, we back-to-back it with supply. So we\u2019re basically locking a gross margin for the term of the transaction. We always have the option to either source it internally through our generation or source it from the market depending on what\u2019s the most optimal way for us.","And then number three, you\u2019re always going to see the impact of though \u2013 that business in our earnings. So, transparency, clarity, visibility, it is important. So, while I can \u2013 I mean, in a contango market on a backward-dated market, when you\u2019re doing a term deal, is there \u2013 are you levelizing the curve, and it creates a different dynamic? Yes, of course.","But I mean, the most important thing here is supply. We\u2019re trying to lock in a margin through the term of the deal. And we want to make sure that supply and the \u2013 I guess, the C&I deal, the revenue line and the cost line is pretty consistent.","Ali Agha","Okay. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing comments or remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you.

So we'll look forward to them getting to know you and you getting to know them.","So as we get into it, I first want to say how much I appreciate you joining us on this call and also for your understanding of our interest in moving the call from Wednesday when it was originally scheduled in today. As everyone's been very busy over the past few days, this call also represents my first opportunity to speak to the NRG staff as a whole since the storm, so I hope you'll be patient if I touch upon a couple of points that might naturally be of more interest to employees than to external investors.","Obviously with our headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey and many of our employees resident in the Princeton area, the functioning of our headquarters was significantly impacted by Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath. Even as we speak, our main headquarters building is running on emergency backup power and most of us are living in homes without light, either, in some cases, running water. So while the obvious purpose of this call is to discuss our financial performance over the course of a quarter which ended more than a month ago, I would be remiss if I did not first address the natural calamity that was visited upon the mid-Atlantic and Northeast states this past week.","First and foremost, we hope that everyone participating on this call and each of your loved ones is safe and sound after Hurricane Sandy. I'm pleased to report that all of our own people and their families are accounted for. But as we all know, everyone in our home state of New Jersey has not been so fortunate. There have been multiple fatalities and beyond many more injured, some seriously, and billions and billions of dollars in property damage, particularly in our coastal regions.","As has been the practice at NRG in the wake of every natural catastrophe since the Indonesian tsunami several years ago, I'm pleased to announce today a triple matching program open to NRG employees and benefiting first responder NGOs providing essential aid and services to New Jerseans who have lost everything this past week.","Secondly I am pleased to report that our generation fleet in the Northeast performed very well during and since the storm. Most of our plants were online as the storm approached and performed as they were called upon to do by the system operator. We experienced no material damage to any of our assets and as such, we do not expect the storm to have a material impact on our financial or operational performance.","Third I want to express my deep respect, appreciation and my profound admiration for the men and women of NRG who, as these terrible storms approach, voluntarily separate themselves from their families in order to keep our power plants running, our IT systems operating and our call centers staffed to provide full customer service. Even in normal circumstances, our employees know that we are engaged in a 24\/7 business. In the case of Hurricane Sandy, NRG employees, too numerable to mention, manned their positions and kept our plants running and ready to respond to disruptions to the system.","As great an effort as was made by our own people, everyone at NRG recognizes that disruptive weather events like Sandy primarily impact the T&D end of the power sector. And while we at NRG are not a T&D company, our hats go off to the work crews from PSE&G and the other T&D utilities in the Northeast and from many other parts of the country who are working around-the-clock to restore the region's transmission and distribution system.","Fourth and finally, allow me to make one long-term strategic point. Hurricane Sandy, like the other extreme weather events that have preceded it with increasing frequency in recent years has vividly demonstrated once again, how absolutely vital the constant flow of electricity is to virtually every facet of our society. Electricity is truly the lifeblood that animates our economy. As such, it strikes me as absolutely foolish that in order to energize our 21st century economy, we depend on an archaic poles and wires transmission system that remains mired in 1930s technology.","I mean seriously, could you imagine that more than a decade into the 21st century, we base our entire electricity delivery system on wooden poles? So new cost-effective and cleaner distributor technologies exist that have the ability to free American consumers and businesses from this system and NRG expects to be deeply involved in providing these grid-independent solutions to American businesses and residential customers in the future.","Already we have a team within NRG called our reliability services group, which while still very small relative to the total is one of the fastest-growing businesses within NRG. Today is not the day to elaborate on our plans in this area but you'll be hearing more from us in the future.","So let's turn to Slide 4 and to our performance in the third quarter. As you well know by now, there was a comparative absence of summer heat in Texas this year, certainly relative to the blistering summer of 2011, yet our results nonetheless show the strength and resilience of our wholesale-retail business model, with the third quarter with $657 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and $1.496 billion year-to-date. So even notwithstanding the mild winter in the Northeast last winter followed by the comparatively mild summer just ended in Texas, I am pleased to report that we are on track to achieve a full-year financial result around the center of our original guidance range. Beyond EBITDA, there is the familiar positive NRG story of strong free cash flow generation with $806 million year-to-date of free cash flow before growth.","Turning to Slide 5. As we have posted solid summer results in the face of a noncooperative weather environment, I believe it's worthwhile to reinforce the point of why we see premium value in our integrated wholesale-retail business. As you recall, after our experience with the Texas summer of 2011, we went into the summer of 2012 with considerable length in our wholesale position in Texas. And as you can see from Slide 5, wholesale volumes and spot prices were both dramatically lower year-on-year as a direct result of the absence of extreme weather, which -- and this would have had a negative impact on our financial performance had we been only a wholesaler.","However, conditions that were unfavorable for wholesale were broadly favorable for retail. While load was down some 5% from 2011, the fact remains that when wholesale prices are depressed and load is strong, retail should and did perform very well. For NRG's integrated model, the combination of these factors drives strong financial performance across the full commodity price cycle, essentially providing the financial floor to weather a weak wholesale environment while preserving the upside in the event of a robust wholesale price environment. It is this dynamic that largely should enable us to deliver to the midrange of our 2012 EBITDA guidance.","And turning to Slide 6, before turning over to Mauricio, let me make one comment about the still pending GenOn transaction. This should be the last earnings call on which we are reporting NRG on a stand-alone basis. The approval process is well on track and no major subset issue has been raised by or to any of the authorities whose approval of this acquisition is still pending. Integration planning is making great progress under a joint task force led by Anne Cleary of GenOn. She and all of her colleagues from NRG and GenOn engaged in integration plan are doing a great job and I'm pleased to report that we are well on track to identifying with great specificity all of the $175 million in cost synergies estimated and publicly disclosed at the time the deal was announced. In short, while a lot of hard work remains to be done in the implementation phase, I couldn't be more pleased with where we stand as we approach the end of the planning phase. Likewise, I have a very high degree of confidence in the management team and indeed, in all the personnel that have been identified to take the combined company forward post closing.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio to talk in more detail about the company's performance during the third quarter. Mauricio?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before we go into the results for this quarter, I want to join David on expressing my respect and appreciation to our colleagues in NRG's Northeast operations that kept our units available throughout the summer. To all of them, thank you, and job well done.","Now back to the results for the quarter on Slide 8. Our integrated platform performed well despite low power prices across our Texas region. Our improved risk management activities not only protected the retail business during the few periods of high prices but also provided an opportunity to hedge our wholesale portfolio at attractive levels in the weeks and months ahead market leading and during the summer months. Our operational performance was solid, led by our South Texas project's perfect record during the quarter. Noteworthy is the plant record set by Unit 1 with 530 consecutive days in operation before entering a refueling outage this fall. This is a great accomplishment by the STP team and one that makes us all proud of their operating track record.","On the environmental front, I am pleased to announce a reduction in our environmental CapEx from $553 million to $440 million, driven primarily by changes to our mass compliance plan for Big Cajun II, Unit 3. We conducted additional stack testing and engineering studies to evaluate the performance of the existing ESP unit with activated carbon injection. Based on these results, the need for a backhouse in Unit 3 has been replaced with an operational ESP. The remainder of the reduction relates to completing the Indian River projects under budget, thanks to the excellent job of our EPC group and changes in the smaller air quality and 316(b) projects.","The other positive news is that we have come to agreement with EPA on the terms of a settlement for the Big Cajun II NSR litigation. The agreement does include some control technology changes, but I cannot disclose the details as it will not be public until it makes its way through DOJ's legal approval process. We do not, however, anticipate an increase in environmental capital beyond the $440 million already disclosed.","Finally, El Segundo and our solar projects continue to remain on track with now more than 400 megawatts of solar expected by year end. We have also begun construction of the 75 megawatt peaking plant at Parish, which eventually will be used on our current conserve project, but in the meantime, we will participate in the market during the next few years when reserve margins are expected to be the tightest.","Turning to our normal operational metrics on Slide 9 and starting with safety. We are on pace to have the best safety year in our history and well within top decile performance. For the third quarter, 45 out of 51 facilities were without a single recordable injury. This is an outstanding accomplishment and further demonstrates our strong safety culture that leads to best-in-class operational performance. Coal generation was down 8% for the quarter compared to last year as a result of both lower gas generation in Texas due to weaker prices and lower coal availability. This decrease was partially offset by higher gas generation in California, our Cottonwood facility and Arthur Kill.","Moving on to Slide 10, our multi-brand retail business continued to deliver strong results with EBITDA now at $504 million for the first 9 months of the year. In addition, we have now grown our retail portfolio by 124,000 customers in total and 79,000 customers in the Northeast. This is driven by successful marketing, sales and operations execution. Bad debt remains consistent with 2011 and customer acquisition is at our strongest levels.","Our effective hedging and supply management strategy, combined with innovation and premium customer service, have enabled us to maintain our margin levels despite sustained low gas prices and rising heat rates, as well as intense competition across customer segments. In fact, given the lack of scarcity pricing this summer, unit margins increased quarter-over-quarter. Outside of Texas, NRG's retail business continues to innovate and expand by deepening our penetration in new markets, where in less than 2 years we have entered 11 states and the District of Columbia and now 10% of our load servicing the Northeast.","Once again, the result for the quarter is that we struck a balance between customer accounts and margin consistent with our long-term strategy. And this strong performance has enabled NRG to remain the largest retailer in Texas with a growing presence in the Northeast. Based on recent conversations I've had with many of you, I want to provide some observations about the Texas summer on Slide 11.","On the supply side, capacity was relatively unchanged with a net increase of 1% summer-over-summer. However, on the demand side and with the return to normal weather, total load was lower by 6% compared to the record summer of 2011. Despite these normal conditions, ERCOT still managed to set multiple monthly peak load record during the summer. We believe this underscores the fundamental strength of the Texas market. The combination of lower demand, unchanged supply and the lack of sustained heat resulted in disappointingly low prices compared to last year. In fact, in a year with normal weather, prices were the lowest in a decade. This highlights the need for the additional market reforms approved and under consideration by the commission to ensure adequate supply for the growing power needs of Texas.","Turning to Slide 12. We continue to see positive developments on both the natural gas and the Texas market. Over the past few months, the gas storage surplus that was alarming at the beginning of the injection season has almost disappeared and is heading back to the normal historical range. Production has remained stagnant now for close to 12 months in a row and demand by the power sector is up by almost 17% for the year. As you can see on the lower left chart, cash prices have continued to increase and forward prices have firmed up well above coal to gas switching territory for PRB generators but remain competitive vis-\u00e0-vis Eastern coal generators.","As discussed in the previous slide, the PUCT remains focused and committed to ensure a long-term resource adequacy solution. On August 1 the system-wide offer cap was raised from $3,000 to $4,500 per megawatt-hour. And just last week, on October 25, the commission unanimously approved a further increase in price cap up to $9,000 per megawatt-hour by 2015. We are encouraged by these actions and will continue to work with the PUCT and other stakeholders to find a long-term solution. We remain very bullish the Texas market. In fact, even under our low economic growth case provided by ERCOT last week, and the addition of new generation announced, reserve margins will fall below the target reserve margin by 2014.","Turning to Slide 13, you can see from our hedging disclosure that we have increased our baseload gas hedges in 2013. In the short term, we continue to be well insulated from natural gas prices, and given the recent market changes in Texas, we have benefited from our open heat rate position. In the medium to long term, where we've seen significant exposure, so as the markets improve, we start to benefit from our heat rate expansion and gas recovery. Since our last quarterly call, I am pleased to report 2 other items of note. First, our commercial team finalized the Limestone plant's rail transportation contract under favorable terms. Second, our previously announced extension of our Form C coal contracts were ratified by the Louisiana PSC, both start to position the company well for the future.","Finally, and moving onto the GenOn combination on Slide 14, as David mentioned in his comments, we are on track to meet our cost synergy targets. I am pleased to say that we remain very optimistic about the operational synergies that will be gained in the new organization, largely driven by the success of fornrg program. On a stand-alone basis, we are currently on track to deliver $7 million over this year's $30 million fornrg target through a combination of asset optimization, property tax relief and retail cost initiatives.","With respect to the GenOn transaction, we have already identified the specific areas that we will further evaluate once the transaction closes, which will yield an improvement to our fornrg targets of $10 million and $25 million respectively over the next 2 years. Areas where we see significant opportunity includes aggressively reducing fixed costs such as property tax, implementing more flexibility in our operations staff through mobile and seasonal operations, evaluating opportunities to add natural gas capabilities and leveraging a centralized procurement function. Finally and most importantly, after the transaction closes, we will be able to refine our estimates. And if past performance is an indication, we hope to more than deliver on these results.","With that, I will turn things over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 16. NRG is reporting third quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $657 million, with $449 million from our wholesale business, $173 million from our retail platforms and $35 million from our solar projects, which are now a growing part of our financial performance. For the first 9 months of 2012, adjusted EBITDA totaled nearly $1.5 billion, with $928 million from wholesale, $504 million from retail and $64 million from our solar project. Year-to-date, NRG has generated nearly $1 billion in adjusted cash flow from operations, which drove free cash flow before growth of $806 million through the first 9 months of 2012, placing us already within the range of our previous free cash flow guidance for all of 2012. This performance also contributed to an increase of over $600 million in total liquidity since the year end, after taking into account the redemption of the remaining $270 million of our 2017 senior notes on October 24.","Turning to capital allocation, with the refinancing of the 2017 notes, we've now achieved $100 million in debt reduction toward our plan of at least $1 billion of deleveraging announced as a part of the GenOn transaction. Importantly, this reduction in debt, combined with a lower coupon on the newly issued 2023 notes, will result in an annual interest saving of approximately $14 million. This gives us a head start on realizing the $100 million in annual cash flow benefit driven by balance sheet efficiencies resulting from the GenOn transaction.","And as Mauricio previously mentioned, our environmental capital expenditure forecast for 2012 through 2016 has also been reduced by approximately $110 million. This is primarily the result of a decrease in estimated costs related to match compliance, in particular our Big Cajun II facility, as we've now completed testing based on the final rules. The anticipated completion of projects with our original budget and shifting compliance schedules based on regulatory changes also helped drive the reduction in the cost estimate.","From an operational perspective, third quarter highlights include a 21% improvement in Texas realized energy margin, which is attributed to our portfolio optimization effort to help reduce the overall risk in our portfolio. Meanwhile, NRG's 3 retail platforms continued to see strong customer addition, with 124,000 total improvement in customer accounts, led by an increase of 79,000 customers in the Northeast.","In summary, consistent with the expectations that I shared with you on our first quarter call, over the last 2 quarters, we've seen EBITDA outperformance from our solar projects, the continued strength of our retail businesses and improved effectiveness of our hedging and portfolio optimization efforts. All of which, despite the relatively milder weather this past summer, have now placed us ahead of pace on EBITDA versus the first 9 months of 2011. This strong performance leads us to narrow our 2012 EBITDA guidance to the middle of our previous range, which takes me to the guidance overview, which you'll find on Slide 17.","As reflected in the first column of the slide, we're narrowing our guidance for 2012 adjusted EBITDA to $1.875 billion to $1.925 billion and 2012 free cash flow before growth to $900 million to $950 million. In addition, we are also reaffirming our stand-alone guidance ranges for 2013 and 2014 EBITDA, as well as free cash flow before growth. Specifically, we're maintaining guidance for stand-alone adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for both of 2013 and 2014 and we expect free cash flow before growth of $650 million to $850 million in '13 and $500 million to $700 million for '14. As I indicated on our previous calls, the guidance ranges for 2013 and 2014 reflect our expectations for NRG on a stand-alone basis, excluding the accretive impact of the pending transaction with GenOn, which would then be incremental to these numbers.","As highlighted on the slide, we've broken down the expected EBITDA contribution from our wholesale, retail and solar projects. The wholesale segment, which delivered $928 million in EBITDA through the first 9 months of the year, is on pace to contribute $1.17 billion to $1.195 billion in 2012. We continue to expect wholesale to deliver EBITDA of $850 million to $965 million in '13 and $705 million to $820 million in '14. And these ranges include the impact of the addition of the El Segundo Energy Center project, which will achieve COD in August of 2013. Our wholesale guidance ranges also include the recurring savings from efficiencies and operational improvements resulting from our fornrg program.","Our retail businesses, having delivered $504 million in EBITDA through the first 9 months of the year, are expected to contribute $630 million to $650 million in 2012. These results are driven by both the success of our customer growth initiatives and focus on delivering customer value beyond the mere commodity. Collectively, these efforts both reinforce our leading Texas position and support our expanding presence in the Northeast. We expect retail to deliver EBITDA of $650 million to $725 million in '13 and $675 million to $750 million in 2014.","Our solar projects, which continue to exceed our expectations for the pace of EBITDA contribution, had delivered $64 million through the first 9 months of '12 and are back on track to contribute $75 million to $80 million of EBITDA in 2012 for the full year. This reflects the impact of accelerating the pace of construction in our Tier 1 solar project. As these projects continue to reach COD, we expect our EBITDA contribution to increase to a range of $200 million to $210 million in '13 and $320 million to $330 million in 2014.","Turning to committed growth investments on Slide 18. We now expect a total of $690 million of growth investments for 2012, which represents a $220 million increase over our August 8 guidance of $470 million. This increase is solely attributable to changes in our solar investments, nearly all of which are associated with the timing of debt funding for our non-DOE utility project, which we now expect to occur in the first quarter of 2013. And as a result, by the year end, we now expect to have fully funded in the aggregate our equity contribution to our Tier 1 solar portfolio. Our expectations for conventional growth investments are unchanged from previous guidance.","And finally, turning briefly to corporate liquidity on Slide 19. As I mentioned earlier, total liquidity improved by more than $600 million since the year end after adjusting for the redemption of the remaining $270 million of the 2017 senior notes. This increase in liquidity is due to both improvements in cash balances, as well as increased availability under our revolving credit facility. The $235 million increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2011 was driven by $993 million of adjusted cash from operations, $174 million in proceeds from the sale of Schkopau, $122 million in proceeds from the Agua Caliente project selldown. That's partially offset by $707 million of capital investments and $172 million of unsecured note paydowns, which includes the $100 million of deleveraging I mentioned earlier. Increases in our revolver availability remain largely the result of the Agua Caliente selldown in the first quarter, which resulted in a $304 million reduction in LC posting.","We enter the final months of 2012 with a stronger balance sheet, including longer debt maturities, streamlined debt covenants and improved liquidity, driven by successful monetization efforts and a year-over-year increase in EBITDA. These improvements, combined with a head start both on our deleveraging objectives and our cash flow synergies, place us on a solid financial footing to fully realize the substantial benefits of the GenOn transaction in 2013 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks.","David W. Crane","Kirk, thank you. In closing, let me say that one of the things we always try to do at NRG is tell the market what we're going to do and then go out and try and do it. Towards that end, for the 9 years that I've been in this job, it's been my practice during the first quarterly call of the year to lay out for our shareholders what we hope to accomplish during the year ahead. And then on the last quarterly call of the year, to measure our progress against the objectives that were previously announced.","Accordingly on Slide 21, you will find our goals for 2012 repeated from our February 2012 earnings presentation, together with my personal assessment of how we have performed against those goals. Suffice it to say, I feel that we have substantially advanced and strengthened our position against each of the 4 pillars of our strategy: Enhance core generation, expand retail, lead clean energy and maintain prudent capital allocation.","Now as Kirk was saying, we intend to end the year strong, close the GenOn transaction and hit the ground running in 2013 as a 46,000-megawatt generator with ample liquidity, enviable asset portfolios across each of the 3 key regional competitive electricity markets in the United States, a robust and growing multimillion base of retail customers in markets that match up nicely with our generation, and a leading first mover position in the provision of critical consumer-oriented and customer-focused clean energy technologies that we believe may have a disruptive impact on our sector over the medium to long term. The future is indeed bright for NRG.","With that, Laura, we'd be happy to answer any questions that anyone might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jon Cohen, ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My first question is on the Texas resource adequacy project. It seems like the only thing that all 3 commissioners [indiscernible] can now agree on is that demand response has to be part of the solution in ERCOT. And I know Commissioner Anderson is hopeful that the reps can actually come up with some sort of market-based solution to that, but I can't really figure out how that would work. So if Reliant for instance were to figure out some incentive to curtail customer load during the peaks and that should lower prices for everyone not just the Reliant customers and the benefit you get from peaking would seem to erode. Have you given any thought to that and how do you think such a demand response retail product might look, especially if there's no consensus on a centralized capacity market?","David W. Crane","Well, Jon, let me first say, and not only say, that we've given a lot of thought to it and it is a competitive environment and I'm not sure how much detail we want to give you but I'm looking at Mauricio, who's shaking his head. Now Elizabeth, do you want to say anything about this because there is a clear opportunity here.","Elizabeth Killinger","We have invested over the years in our e-Sense suite of products, which actually includes everything from time-of-use products to some device-based solutions, and we do believe -- we have thousands of customers on products like that, and we do believe that there will be growing needs and interests in products like that and we're continuing to develop those in the months ahead.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And I just have one other question for Kirk on solar. And I guess the question is, once you have the projects up and running and they reach COD, how much time do you have to sell down a stake to a JV partner to tax equity before the unutilized tax losses have to be booked on the balance sheet and be sort of taken down over time versus monetized immediately? And is that the end of the tax year or do you have another year after that? And the second question is, in your stand-alone free cash flow guidance, how much of the cash flow can be attributed specifically to the utilization of solar tax losses in '13 and '14?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Sure. The answer to your first question, Jon, on the free cash flow side, once we reach the levelized contribution of EBITDA, which purports with that range in 2014 of $300 million to $330 million, the corresponding cash flow associated with that number, which we expect from the projects, which is really solely the result of the operating cash flow separate and apart from the benefits of the -- on the tax side, is approximately $80 million. Now above and beyond that, while we are not currently in a position to be a tax payer given our NOL balance, over time, our utilization of that beyond 2014 will enhance the cash flow benefits above and beyond the number I just shared with you. As far as selldowns are concerned, the opportunity for us to engage in selldowns really, speaking specifically to the Agua Caliente project first, it was important to us to monetize that particular project because of the need to be able to realize the benefits fully in the monetization of the selldown around the ITC component of that project, which is unique relative to the other projects in the Tier 1 solar portfolio, which as you know are all cash-grant projects. It is necessary, if we're going to get paid or provide to our partner the benefits of the ITCs, to sell that down before COD. Beyond that point, we have the opportunity to pursue selldowns in the future beyond COD and we don't have a necessary limitation from a capital perspective as far as sharing the benefits from a depreciation standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley, Deutsche Bank.","Keith Stanley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping for some more color on the Alternative Energy segment. The release said solar has contributed $64 million of EBITDA year-to-date but the segment as a whole has only contributed $35 million. And I guess, my understanding is that the Alternative Energy segment is wind and solar but it seems like there's also some drags in that segment. So can you just talk about some of those things that are offsetting.","David W. Crane","Sure. Our Alternative Energy segment, in addition to the businesses that you just mentioned, also include some of our new businesses, which are as you know in a start-up mode, one of which is our eVgo business, which currently, we're in the process of ramping up on the customer side. Obviously, we have a significant amount of capital spend, which has been increased by virtue of the settlement that took place in California. And as we begin to add customers, we expect the EBITDA contribution from that to offset the overhead. So right now what you're seeing reflective, as you say, the difference between the positive EBITDA on the alternative energy along the solar side being offset by some of the early-stage costs associated with the ramping up some of those businesses like eVgo, as well as there's a slight amount of overhead associated with the Petra Nova project as well.","Keith Stanley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One other follow-up, if I can. Just looking at the retail contributions, the projections through 2014, can you talk a little bit more about the increase that you expect there from 2012 to 2014 just given the now rising gas and power prices from a 2012 base? Should we assume you can hold margins flattish on existing customers and then see some EBITDA growth from new customers or how should we think about your margin assumptions there for the existing customer base over the next few years?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Well, I'll answer that in terms of the guidance and I'll let Elizabeth follow up with anything she'd like to add. From my perspective, looking at the guidance and the growth therein, we certainly would look given the commodity environment that the preponderance of that growth would come from the customer side of the equation rather than the margin expansion side of the equation. And certainly, our focus is on growing the customer base in the Northeast, where we see the real growth potential for us moving forward. As far as margins are concerned, I don't think we see certainly a lot of expansion on the margin side of things but I'll certainly let Elizabeth or Jim address any particulars around what they see moving forward on the margin side of the equation.","Elizabeth Killinger","Thanks, Kirk. No, we don't expect to see expansion in margins. But to Kirk's point, we do expect to see customer growth. But that said, we -- our long-term strategy is to balance margins and customer account, and so we will do the right thing to make sure we can deliver on those commitments as well as adding additional services to customers we currently have so it increase the share loss we have in a particular customer.","Kirkland B. Andrews","And Elizabeth, I think your comments about margins and all was sort of focused on the ERCOT market. Jim, did you want to say anything about the Northeast market in margins and customer account and the like?","Jim Steffes","I mean, I think we do see growth opportunities in the Northeast clearly aligned with the multibrand, multisegment business that we have. Building on what Elizabeth said as well, we do have the opportunity to expand share of wallet. We intend to do that to go beyond commodity in the Northeast but we're just really getting started there. I think there is a huge opportunity in the Northeast overall.","David W. Crane","There is a huge opportunity in the Northeast but, Keith, I would say that what you're seeing in the projections expects growth in the Northeast but while we'll be seeking heroic growth in the Northeast, there is no assumption of heroic growth in the numbers that we put out there for 2013 and '14, it's more sort of linear growth.","Keith Stanley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could just follow up quickly, so for just looking at the Texas business and the existing customers, it sounds like you're not embedding any margin expansion for sure. But should we assume there's some margin contraction, given the rising price environment or should we assume more of a flattish outlook on that core customer base?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, I think you should assume, Keith, that we -- our assumptions that margin stay relatively stable on the retail side in Texas. And so we appreciate the question, Keith, I've got to tell you, just for everyone, the next questioner, I've been warned by Chad that we have to keep it to one follow-up question because -- so unfortunately, Keith, we'll have to go on, if you have any other questions, though, give us a call.","Operator","Your next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So when do you plan on providing more clarity around capital allocation guidance, is it your 4Q call early next year? And maybe as a sneak preview, can you provide some sort of framework here, for buybacks versus dividends versus other sources of capital allocation?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Well, I think it's fair to say that guidance on further capital allocation, the fourth quarter call February next year is a good bet. Depending on when the transaction closes and the circumstances, if we have newsworthy things to talk about, we've contemplated maybe having a call after the transaction closed that might have more information about capital allocation, but you can't put that in the bank. So I would say February next year. The only thing I would tell you, speaking on half of the company about capital allocation is, clearly, you can see from the words that we've used consistently for the last 9 years, prudent balance sheet management, we've tended in terms of returning capital to the stakeholders to return capital through buyback and debt reduction in sort of equal amounts. Now we have the dividend. We feel that we owe the market a little bit more information about directionally where we're going to take the dividends. You certainly can count on that. But between buybacks and paying down debt, I think I would repeat what I believe I said on the last quarter call is, maybe relative to where we were over the last few years, we've got a little bit more of a lean towards the debt repayment side just because this combined company -- it's got a lot of cash flow, but it's got a lot of debt as well, so we'd like to get that number down if we could.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My follow-up question is around Texas here. In 2011 we had, I think, it was 27 hours of scarcity pricing. In '12 we had almost none. Assuming normal demand levels, how do you think about what is the normal number of scarcity hours as you look at 2014?","Kirkland B. Andrews","I'm going to ask Mauricio to answer that question and then you're not going to be allowed a follow-up question, so even if Mauricio doesn't answer the question, you'll just have to call in and get -- try to get a better answer.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Look, I mean, I think the amount of scarcity pricing hours that you can see at any given year is, as you know, a function of weather and you alluded to 2011 extreme weather, and we actually felt that in 2012 it was a normal weather. We were surprised to see that many few hours, I guess, of scarcity pricing. So I think -- and then you have the supply side of the equation to deal with and specific unit outages that may contribute to that. Instead of answering exactly what is the number of hours, what I can tell you is that if market is a good indication for what the potential impact is in terms of dollars per-megawatt hour, we saw 2013 move anywhere between $3 to $5 per megawatt hour on a round-the-clock basis. So I think that just gives you a little bit of a proxy in terms of not only the number of scarcity hours but also the impact of the new price caps that the commission has approved.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Best of luck on the continued recovery after the storm. Just had one question on solar growth outlook. In the past, you've talked about tax advertising, this was discussed earlier a little bit. But as we think about potentially reloading and continuing to grow the solar business, does tax appetite have a -- does that play into that decision? In other words, should we -- when we think about 2013, '14 and into '15, should we be thinking about continued ability to greatly expand the solar portfolio?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Well, the first thing I would say is, yes, we certainly have the ability to continue to expand the Solar portfolio. I think, however, in contrast with the past, our expectation is that the magnitude of individual opportunities that would make up that continued growth on the Solar portfolio would certainly be smaller, especially than what we've in the past with the Tier 1 portfolio, especially as regards what I tend to refer to as kind of the Big 3. In terms of our tax position, I think that it's safe to say that we will evaluate and investments in Solar will be made under consideration of either our ability to monetize the tax attributes or our ability to efficiently use them given our existing tax position. And so we will make decisions as to investment in Solar on the basis of one or the other of those 2 moving forward. But we don't see that as being a material constraint on expanding the business moving forward.","David W. Crane","Stephen, can I actually -- I'd like to add a little bit more to what Kirk said. Because I mean you're -- I think you're touching upon what's a very important area I think to this industry and to us as a company, which is that we obviously are incredibly bullish on Solar. We see enormous opportunity for our company in Solar. We also are -- completely recognize that Solar is a business that, as you say, is driven by tax matters to some degrees, but it's a very capital intensive industry with all the capital being required up front. And it requires a lot more capital than we have as a company. We've been, maybe from your perspective, taking our time to get other people's money involved in our solar projects because we still think the market is mispricing on a risk-adjusted basis or I should say on a lack of risk-adjusted basis, the returns that people should be willing to accept in the solar business. Having said that, we see enormous creativity going on in the banks and in the markets in terms of more people being attracted to the solar space. So we're very confident that during the course of 2013 and beyond, you will see our company continue on the solar path we're on and getting other people's lower cost capital involved in our projects in a way that's enhancing for everybody, including and most notably for us, our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell, Jefferies & Company.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Hopefully just a quick question. I'm wondering if you could break up the wholesale guidance, say, $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion for 2012. What's the contribution there from non-baseload assets?","David W. Crane","Anthony, we're not going to break down the difference between baseload and non-baseload where that's concerned. I think we're comfortable taking into consideration all what we see in the forward market, especially with the changes that have most recently come about in ERCOT, and we've taken that into consideration in terms of the contribution on the peaking side of the equation. But beyond that, I don't think we're going to break that down in further detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, just on Jason's departure from Reliant. I was wondering if you could discuss any updates to your strategy. Thus far, it doesn't sound like anything but just kind of curious on that, is there anything we should read from his departure?","Christopher S. Moser","No, I don't think there is. What I can do -- I mean, honestly, no one wants to have their personal situation discussed on this type of public call, but I can assure that had nothing to do with the type of issues that shareholders usually care about, which would be like the strategic direction of retail. And we see enormous opportunity in retail, we want to grow it, we want to grow it aggressively. Today, we have with us Elizabeth and Jim, and I would tell you, Julien, that probably one of the most significant changes that's occurred in this company that no one on the outside would have seen, but I can see from the inside is, really when we bought Reliant a few years ago, I mean, we were basically a generation company run by generation people and then we had a retail subsidiary. And the business model that we're talking about in these investor presentations of a generation retail model with equal weight on both is very much the way our management is. And both Elizabeth and Jim are backed up by very strong retail-experienced management team. So I have the highest confidence in both of them and their teams and there really is nothing that is worth you reading into about Jason's departure.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And maybe a quick follow-up here, just discussing the year-on-year drivers, looking at 3Q for the Reliant segment, I -- intuitively, I thought a mild summer would drive higher results. Looks like the release at least alludes to cost inflation due to customer acquisitions, perhaps, be it premised on mid-Atlantic expansion. What kind of cost inflation are we talking about -- have we seen, thus far, and particularly going forward in your '13 and '14 guidance, if you can talk to that.","Kirkland B. Andrews","So cost inflation specifically on the retail side. I mean, look...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, exactly.","David W. Crane","I mean, well, I guess, well, there's the customer acquisition aspect and there's also I think everyone recognizes that with greater volatility in Texas, I mean that there's greater cost in terms of arranging your wholesale supply on the retail side. And that's an area where we believe we have a competitive advantage relative to other retail electricity providers because of our own wholesale position. So -- but Elizabeth, if you want to talk about cost of acquisition in Texas or the cost question. And Jim, I don't know if you have anything to add from the Northeast that you can...","Elizabeth Killinger","Yes, so we do have slight increases in costs but to David's point, they really are associated with the growth. Some of -- the bulk of that this year has been Northeast expansion, but we've also added some new products and expanded sales channels in ERCOT and in the Northeast as well. And I would expect that going forward, not significant increases. Jim, I don't know if you'd add anything.","David W. Crane","We can go into it further, if you want to talk about it, call us directly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","First about the Northeast and your retail business. So you've added thousands of new customers and you don't really have much of a generation assets to serve them. So I understand that you're using market purchases to meet your load obligations and how should we think about it now that the Hurricane Sandy hit and then many of those customers are not connected to the grid anymore and you have purchased power to serve them, shouldn't we imply that actually this should have a negative earnings contribution?","David W. Crane","Wow, Angie. Mauricio, do you want to take a whack at that?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, keep in mind that we have 7,000 megawatts of generation in the Northeast and many of the products that you use to manage your retail load like capacity and baseload generation or block generation, we can source it internally from our existing resources. I mean, so far, the portfolio -- the size of the portfolio is small enough that 7,000 megawatts is more than enough to manage that retail load obligation. But clearly as the retail grows, the need for having additional generation in the Northeast becomes critical and that's where the transaction with GenOn, we see synergies similar to what we've been able to do in ERCOT. But that's on the supply side. In the impact of Sandy in our Northeast customers, it is -- I would say, I would characterize it as immaterial. And what I would say just from what we can tell on the wholesale side, load in general in the Northeast, depending on what state you were, was down anywhere between 20% to 30% for the last couple of days. So while load was down overall, the impact to our retail franchises were very small and immaterial.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","And the last question. You mentioned the renegotiations of your Limestone coal contract. Could you give us any color of how beneficial to your earnings that is?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Angie, I wish I could but -- this is a -- we historically haven't provide specifics around coal transportations because of the confidentiality that we're bound with our counterparties and the competitive nature of them. What I can tell you is that it was in favorable terms and we have seen, I think, the height of the rail contract rates when gas was $10 to $12 from MMBTU. I think they're behind us, so not only they're favorable, but they're also more flexible in terms of our operational, I guess, flexibility being redundant -- operational flexibility around the rail contract.","David W. Crane","And we like to give credit where credits due and we've talked in the past on these calls about the constructive attitude that's been taken towards these negotiations in terms of the commodity price environment we're in and we just want to say that we appreciate Burlington Northern in particular in terms of the way that they've worked with us in a constructive fashion to keep these plants competitive. So -- but that's about as much detail as you're going to get.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill from Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about the next later generation growth opportunities beyond what you've talked about earlier in the backlog. And understanding that you haven't completed the GenOn transaction yet, just sort of from a -- what are the conventional buildup opportunities or areas that you think you might need to add assets so we can get a sense for how that might play a role in capital allocation over the next few years.","David W. Crane","Well, Gregg, it's a good question. I tell you, it's hard to make a general comment. I mean, I guess the most general comment I would say is that there hasn't been a large build of conventional generation in this country, across our core markets obviously, since the recession. And reserve margins, I mean clearly, we focus here on Texas and Mauricio talked about how they are tightening. But while we haven't seen the same level of demand growth over the past few years in the Northeast United States and in California, there there's more a question of retirements and how those retired assets get replaced and California has in particular the 316(b) issue that could cause the retirement of a lot of coastal issues and the Northeast just has a lot of old assets. And so it's almost region by region and location by location. We are looking -- we think we have a competitive advantage really across our fleet in terms of brownfield versus greenfield, in terms of the cost advantage and other advantages you get by redeveloping at your existing sites. But virtually anything that we're looking to do at this point because of the sort of overall depressed nature of wholesale electricity prices is going to be on a long-term PPA basis. So you would expect normal project financing and I don't really see a situation in the next year or 2 where we get on one of these calls and say, \"You know what, we just decided to build an 800-megawatt combined cycle plant and we're going to put the whole thing on balance sheet, so there goes $500 million or $600 million. So again, I think that was your first question. So if you have a follow-up question about a specific area, I'd be happy to talk about the New York energy, highway or something like that. But in the interest of time, that's about as much of an overview as I could give you.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just maybe a follow-up on your comments about 316(b) and I think you've -- that was a reduction to the environmental CapEx and what are some of the solutions you're finding there?","David W. Crane","To reduce the environmental -- the current?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, I mean, just to be clear, I mean the main reduction of the environmental CapEx was due to the change from a back house to an ESP operator. And I'm going to say that was 80%, 90% of the total reduction. I mean, some of the unit changes from the 316(b) were relative to the screens that we have used in the Northeast and that we've been very successful on some of our units but I would say that those are the much smaller dollars on the CapEx reduction.","David W. Crane","We've gone over the hour but let's take 2 more questions and we'll try and be quick with the answers.","Operator","Your next question then comes from the line of Brandon Blossman from Tudor.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Let's see, I will be quick. So ERCOT baseload, Mauricio, the PRB hedging strategy, no incremental hedges this quarter, a lot of price volatility, what's the thought process on a go-forward basis around layering in PRB hedges and then on the quarter, it looks like there's an outage on the baseload coal plant in ERCOT, was that a forced outage or something planned?","Mauricio Gutierrez","No. Well, let me start with the ERCOT. I mean, we have some 2 weeks that it's I would say normal operations when you're running a coal plant in the middle of the summer. It was a normal summer from a weather standpoint. It still was warm by any other standards. So we had a -- what I consider a solid availability performance by our baseload fleet but it was not the stellar performance we had in 2011 when, if I recall, we had over 95% availability on our coal fleet. And what was your first question again?","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","The PRB strategy on a go-forward basis.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. Look, I mean, we said that we try to keep a -- balance the hedges on coal and natural gas. We put the coal hedges in 2013. We just closed that. Basically that dark spread with the additional hedges that we layer on the power when natural gas has run up the last few weeks. When you look at 2014 and beyond, we still see an angle in the PRB market and given some of the dynamics and some of the price differential between spot prices and forward price, particularly in 2014, we're going to continue to evaluate where natural gas prices go, where power prices go and make a determination in the future but we're watching that constantly.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just at a very high level on the retail business, a lot of competitors have complained about either lower margins or certainly not the level of -- lower customer growth than they expect. How would you characterize the ability to differentiate versus others in the business?","David W. Crane","Well, I would say, look, maybe -- I mean, the lower margins again have their cost -- for them, has to do with how expensive it is for them to arrange their wholesale supply. I don't really know. I mean, we're comfortable with the margins that we're achieving and I would say that the one thing that we've tried to distinguish ourselves from in what's historically been a very much commoditized business, but I think with each day is becoming a less commoditized business, is that we offer a differentiated product. I mean, Reliant offers a full-service product that increasingly is offering, as Elizabeth said, various smart meter technologies and the like. If you went to the Reliant website as I did yesterday, you would see a picture of the Nest thermostat, which I have in my house and Reliant -- Elizabeth has it in her house, so they're offering a differentiated product there with more smart energy technologies in the house. And Jim in Green Mountain, with obviously with the all-green energy and Energy Plus with the frequent flyer miles and other affinity programs, we're trying to offer something other than just undifferentiated grid power and it seems to be working. And I completely believe that that's the direction that retail is going in and you're not going to see us cut back on that. You're going to see us doing more and more of that.","So thank you all for being patient. And sorry, we took an hour and 10 minutes, but we look forward to talking to you on the February call, if not before, hopefully at the time of the closing of the GenOn acquisition. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."],"16369":["NRG Energy, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded.","And now I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Kevin Cole","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts.","Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","I\u2019d like to start the call by highlighting the three key messages for today\u2019s presentation on Slide 3. First, we continue to demonstrate the value of integration between retail and generation by delivering strong results in 2018 and reaffirming our 2019 guidance. Second, our coal market in Texas remains the most attractive in the country. Our balance and well hedge platform along with enhanced summer readiness programs, positions us to deliver more predictable results. And third, we continue to demonstrate our discipline on capital allocation by adhering to our stated principles and our commitment to being excellent stewards of your capital. Today we\u2019re announcing a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which will bring our total share repurchases in 2018 and 2019 to $2.5 billion.","Moving to Slide 4 with the business and financial highlights. On the left hand side of this slide, you can see our 2018 scorecard. We laid out a very ambitious plan for the year and I am pleased to report that not only did we achieve our goals, but in many cases, we exceeded them. I want to recognize and commend the entire NRG team for their persistence, focus and great execution throughout the year. We achieved our best safety performance ever, our best environmental performance, deliver financial results in the upper half of our guidance and we completed $1.5 billion of share repurchases.","With respect to our transformation plan, we delivered on all our goals. We exceeded our cost savings target, bringing our total savings to over 90% of our objective. We achieved our credit ratio target of 3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and we started to see the impact of our margin enhancement program, which will be a focus in 2019. Also earlier this month, we closed on the sale of South Central and Carlsbad. We did transactions, we have now successfully completed all identify assets sales, bringing total proceeds to $3 billion under the transformation plan.","Outside of these plan, we also closed on the acquisition of XOOM Energy in the second quarter and GenOn fully emerged from bankruptcy in the fourth quarter. Finally, we hosted our Analyst Day last March, which many of you attended. We outline our long-term strategy to create significant shareholder value through perfecting our customer driven integrated power company, built on a portfolio of leading retail brands and diverse generation assets.","On the right hand side of the slide, I want to provide you with a brief financial update for 2019. First, as a reflection of our confidence in the outlook for our business, we are reaffirming 2019 financial guidance and announcing the new $1 billion share repurchase program. Next, we are announcing up to $600 million, reserved for additional deleveraging to achieve investment grade metrics for our sector. Kirk, will discuss these further in his section.","Turning to Slide 5. I want to give you an update on our key markets starting with ERCOT. As you all know, ERCOT\u2019s supply\/demand balance is the tightest it has been in many years. The chart on the left shows the reserve margin by year and highlights how much of that reserve is composed of existing generation and how much of it is from new generation. As you can see, it because more dependent over time on new builds, particularly on wind and solar.","For example, in 2020, ERCOT projects a 10% reserve margin, 3.5% coming from existing resources and the rest coming from new wind and solar. Just to be clear, this is equivalent to nearly 14 gigawatts of new renewable capacity that needs to come online in the next 16 months. Any deviation from that will take us back to single digit reserve margins.","These dynamics has led us to much higher wholesale prices in the near-term, but in the medium to long-term prices are still lagging and remain below new build economics. Making it difficult for developers to justify 20 or 30 year investments. Both the PUCT and ERCOT are aware of the situation and have taken steps to improve the energy only market to better reflect scarcity conditions in the system. We believe these changes will have an impact on forward prices, helping justify long-term investments necessary to increase the reliability of the system in the long run.","Now moving to the right side of the slide. For this summer, we have further enhanced our readiness programs. I feel good about our position and the steps that we have taken to ensure our business is well-positioned for current market conditions. First, let me talk about retail.","Our practice is to have a fully cash position against our price retail load. This is made up of not only internal hedges where we cross generation and retail, but also through market purchases. We\u2019re also working proactively to educate our residential and business customers by providing them options and tools to manage higher energy bills. Specifically, we have been successful in expanding our demand response capabilities to help and manage load during peak conditions.","For generation, we\u2019re working hard during the spring outage season to ensure our units can withstand increased run times, given the expectation of high prices. We also purchased outage insurance and plan to maintain generational length to further protect the platform from real-time price volatility, unplanned outages and higher retail loads.","Last, while our platform today is best position to provide more predictable results relative to pure retailers or wholesale generators. We continue to take prudence and measurable steps to further enhance our platform. For example, with the expectation of higher volatility in the market, it creates an opportunity to acquire customers at-value. And given our scalable customer acquisition engine and our track record of integrating new businesses, we will be in the lookout for these opportunities in order to grow our business and increase market share.","And as our retail business grows, our generation or supply business must grow with it. We have an opportunity to compliment our physical assets, which short to medium-term contracts or PPAs that better align with our load obligations. This strategy allows us to better serve our customers, improves our position management and it is capital-light. Lastly, we continue to take opportunities to hedge the portfolio at attractive levels beyond 2019. Higher hedge prices allow us to invest in our fleet to achieve increased reliability and increase the predictability of our earnings.","Now, let\u2019s move to the East on Slide 6. Our focus remains on regulatory changes for both capacity and energy markets. In PJM, we remain confident that FERC will protect the integrity of competitive markets, while accommodating state clean energy initiatives. Although, our timeline for FERC action remains uncertain. We continue to believe a strong MOPR is the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of nuclear subsidies on the capacity market.","In New England, we are monitoring fuel security efforts. Although we maintain limited exposure to that ISO. We believe these regulatory changes are designed to improve the current status score and are positive for fuel security reforms overall. On the right side of the slide, the chart shows capacity revenues across the northeast markets. It is important to point out that we have a diversified portfolio in the northeast resulting in fairly steady revenues as you can see on the chart.","As we enter 2019 with a renewed sense of purpose to bring the power of energy to people and organizations, it just seems appropriate to provide you a snapshot on our progress and just how far we\u2019ve come along this past three years in strengthening our business, which has resulted in the remarkable financial flexibility we\u2019re enjoying today.","As you can see on Slide 7, the three areas of focus for the company to be successful in the long run were simplify and streamline our business, have an appropriate capital structure for our sector and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. First, we refocus our business on our core strengths of integrating retail and generation. We sold non-core assets or underperforming assets and we right size our generation portfolio to better match our retail business.","Our business today, provides more predictable earnings as we integrate to cyclical but offsetting businesses. Second, we simplify our capital structure with the sale of NRG yield and the separation of GenOn. We also strengthen our balance sheet by deleveraging and targeting appropriate credit metrics for our sector. For 2019, our total debt will be 69% lower than it was three years ago.","Finally, we have also significantly increased our financial flexibility by improving the amount of EBITDA that we convert to free cash flow. Today, close to $0.70 of every $1 are converted to free cash flow compared to only $0.25 three years ago. We are allocating these capital using a set of clear and transparent principles. As I have said in the past, there will be no surprises when it comes to capital allocation.","So the bottom line is this. Our company today is a stronger than it has ever been and what gets me excited is that the best is still yet to come. We\u2019re now a streamline cash flow machine that for the first time have the financial flexibility to create significant and sustainable shareholder value.","Now let\u2019s talk about capital allocation on Slide 8. Continuing with the then and now theme, you can see that our capital location is directly in line with our roadmap to value creation of stabilize, right size and now redefine our business. As you can see on the bar chart, in 2016 and 2017 we stabilized our business through significant deleveraging. If you recall, my first commitment to you three years ago was to leave no doubt in our balance sheet strength and that\u2019s where we focus our excess cash. Then in 2018, we achieved our revised credit metrics of three times net debt-to-EBITDA, leaving significant excess capital available to either grow our business or return capital to our shareholders. We executed the accretive XOOM retail transaction and return just over $1.25 billion of capital to shareholders, reducing our share count by roughly 15%.","Turning to 2019, I want to highlight the steps we\u2019re taking to reposition and redefined the company for long term success. First, we\u2019re allocating up to $600 million of the leveraging. While three times satisfies our leaving out our balance sheet objective, we believe targeting investment grade metrics have some benefits. It will lower our cost of capital, achieving through savings and further improve our equity evaluation. Again, Kirk, we\u2019ll talk more about these in his section. But to be clear, we say up to $600 million of deleveraging, given that it can be achieve in two ways, growing EBITDA or reducing debt.","Next, we are announcing a new $1 billion share repurchase program. I believe a predictable cash flow company like ours should regularly return capital to shareholders. I saw today share buybacks are the most efficient and compelling way to return capital to our shareholders, while also maintaining our current $0.12 per share dividend.","Last and with about a third of our capital on committed, we will remain absolutely discipline in deploying the excess capital, adhering to our capital allocation principles as you can see them on the right side of the page.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirk Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio.","Turning to financial summary on Slide 10, NRG finished 2018 with $1.777 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1.1 billion in free cash flow before growth. In both cases, a 28% increase over 2017. Retail delivered a robust $952 million in adjusted EBITDA, $127 million improvement over last year, driven by margin enhancement, cost reduction initiatives, higher usage, the XOOM acquisition and higher demand response for megawatt sold. Generation EBITDA for 2018 was $825 million, a $261 million increase over 2017, primarily result of increased power prices in Texas and higher capacity prices in PJM.","These 2018 results reflect the financial contribution from our ongoing businesses and exclude the impact of the sales of the South Central assets which closed in early February for $1 billion in gross proceeds. Under GAAP accounting, South Central is treated as discontinued operations and is therefore not part of our reported adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. The closing the South Central transaction when combined with today\u2019s announced closing of Carlsbad for $387 million brings our total asset sale gross proceeds received under the transformation plan to approximately $3 billion.","Turning to the balance sheet. Having met our 2018 debt reduction goals and achieved our target credit metrics originally announced as part of the transformation plan. We are announcing today a revision to our target balance sheet metrics for 2019 and beyond. Our new target balance sheet ranges which I\u2019ll review in greater detail later are based on credit metrics consistent with investment grade ratings. We believe achieving these metrics will not only provide benefits to our balance sheet, but also further reinforced the stability of equity cash flows to help drive a more robust valuation metric for our stock.","To ensure, we align our 2019 balance sheet metrics with these new ranges, we\u2019re reserving up to $600 million of 2019 capital for potential debt reduction. In addition, having completed our $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which was in an average price of $36.24 a share, we\u2019re now allocating $1 billion in 2019 capital towards our newly authorized share buyback program, which Mauricio mentioned earlier.","Turning to our final report on 2018 capital allocation on Slide 11. Changes versus our last update, which are highlighted in blue, result primarily from the slight shift in timing of the receipt of these South Central proceeds into early 2019. And the release of the 2018 cash reserve which was used for credit ratio purposes. During 2018, we completed $1.25 billion of our $1.5 billion share repurchase program, while the balance of $250 million in repurchases under that program was completed in early 2019. We also received $58 million in net cash from insurance associated with the GenOn settlement, which helped offset a portion of our previously allocated settlement payments.","With approximately $0.75 cents of every dollar of capital allocated in 2018 towards the return of shareholder capital or debt reduction, we ended 2018 with approximately $350 million in excess unallocated capital, which will form the basis of 2019 capital allocation. I\u2019ll review 2019 capital allocation in greater detail in a few moments, but I\u2019d like to turn to an update on our credit metrics including our new targets, which you\u2019ll find on Slide 12.","Looking first at 2018, you\u2019ll see that our financial results, which reflected deconsolidation of South Central combined with our net debt balance, inclusive of the South Central proceeds, place us within our transformation plan target credit ratio of three times net debt-to-EBITDA.","Turning to 2019 as indicated earlier, we are revising our target credit metrics to focus on ranges we believe are consistent with investment grade metrics. Highlighted at the bottom of the 2019 column all these revised target ranges which are 2.5 to 2.75 net debt-to-EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations to net debt of 27.5% to 32.5% and interest coverage of between 5.5 and 6.5 times. Although, we are not targeting a specific credit rating at this time, based on our current Standard & Poor\u2019s business risk rating affair, our revised targets replaces in line with investment grade metrics. The chart at the far right of the slide helps illustrate this.","As many of you know, credit rating is a function of two key variables, credit metrics, which is shown on the horizontal axis and business risk on the vertical axis. The shaded grey area represents the approximate inflection point between high yield and investment grade, based on the relationship between these two variables, our objectives here are two-fold. First, moving our balance sheet ratios from our previous target to our revised targets, placing these metrics into investment grade territory based on that business risk rating.","Second, we will continue to execute in order to demonstrate the cash flow resiliency and reduced risk inherent in our integrated platform, which will position us over time to earn an improved business rating. The combination of these two should place us on a strong footing to actually move our rating solidly to investment grade in the future. In other words, should we target a rating in the future that means solid BBB.","In the near term, these new metrics provide other tangible benefits. By reducing debt, we reduced cash interest, which is accretive to free cash flow dollar for dollar due to our abundant NOL balance. This, of course, also improves our conversion factor of EBITDA into free cash flow as well. In addition, by further shrinking our balance sheet, we also strengthen and further reinforced the stability of our equity cash flows, which we believe merits a more robust valuation metric or a lower free cash flow yield.","Finally, we also improve our credit worthiness, which may be further enhanced by future ratings increases, making us a stronger counterparty with reduced need for credit support or collateral, as we execute on our asset-light strategy via PPAs in lieu of physical generation. As shown in the 2019 guidance column, reducing debt by an additional $600 million and the associated reduction in interest expense would place our 2019 ratios near the midpoint of these target ranges.","We have reserved up to $600 million in 2019 capital to ensure we will achieve these new targets in 2019. However, as increasing EBITDA and operating cash flow is an alternative means to achieve these targets as well, the actual amount of debt reduction required maybe less than the $600 million, we have currently reserved.","By way of example and hypothetical, in the event, we find a strategically consistent superior return acquisition opportunity later in the year, the 2.5 turns or so of the EBITDA multiple, we pay in such an investment would represent \u2013 that would represent what we paid in that investment rather that would not require additional capital for that first 2.5 turns of the EBITDA, but merely serve to reduce the $600 million we\u2019ve currently reserved for debt reduction dollar for dollar.","Turning to Slide 13 for an update on 2019 capital allocation having ended 2018 with $350 million in unallocated capital, we\u2019ve since supplemented that through the receipt of approximately $1.3 billion in net cash proceeds from the closing of the South Central and Carlsbad transactions. When combined with the midpoint of our 2019 free cash flow guidance, we expect approximately $3 billion in capital available for allocation in 2019.","Our capital allocation announcements today combined with previously committed allocations represent approximately $2.1 billion of 2019 capital allocated or committed. This consists primarily of $665 million in capital toward debt reduction, including up to $600 million in deleveraging to achieve our new target credit metrics and $1.25 billion in share repurchases.","2019 share repurchase capital includes both a $1 billion program we announced today, plus $250 million of repurchases already completed in 2019, which represents the remaining balance of our $1.5 billion program we announced during 2018. As shown on the far right side of the slide, we have $872 million of excess 2019 capital to be allocated, which we expect to become available over the balance of the year, particularly during the summer months, which contribute the bulk of our 2019 free cash flow.","Finally, this quarter please note, we\u2019ve included in the appendix a few revised slides for your reference, including wholesale open and effective gross margin for 2019 and 2020, as well as some new slides in the presentation summarizing regional capacity revenue. We hope these new disclosures will further enhance our understanding of the drivers of our future financial outlook.","Back to you, Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Kirk. I have a few final remarks on our priorities for the year on Slide 15. As always, our top priority is to deliver on our financial and operational objectives. We remain focused on executing on our transformation plan initiatives, as we direct our attention to margin enhancement in 2019.","Like I said earlier, our company today is stronger than it has ever been. We are now a streamlined cash flow machine that for the first time have the financial flexibility to continue perfecting our platform to make it more balance and predictable, continue strengthening our balance sheet and consistently returning capital to shareholders.","With these priorities, we believe we have an opportunity to create significant shareholder value in the long term. I am very proud of our progress, and I look forward to the next phase in our journey.","Thank you. And with that Jonathan, we\u2019re ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.","Greg Gordon","Hey, good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","So obviously, the results were great and the outlook for the year is still consistent with your prior expectations. I think the overall cash available for allocation is actually higher on the margin than what most people had expected, which is also good. But can you just talk a little bit more about the decision to allocate more capital to debt reduction less, therefore, being available for further buybacks? And how you come to the conclusion that, that over time is more value accretive because I think I understand the answer, but I\u2019d like to hear it from you guys?","A - Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. So well, Greg, I mean, I\u2019ll give you a general perspective and then I\u2019ll let Kirk get into the specifics of why we think this is the area that represents investment grade type of metrics. And as we have done in the past, we are providing you not just our net debt-to-EBITDA, but also some of the cash flow credit metrics because, as you all know, we run this business for cash.","In terms of \u2013 we outlined the benefit that we see in terms of moving towards a more robust credit metric level, I guess. One, it allows us to have access to lower cost of capital. It also reduce our interest expense. Importantly, as we move into an asset-light strategy or capital-light strategy to complement our physical assets, it makes us \u2013 it reduces the collateral that we need to post if we enter into these long-term PPAs. And I think it, ultimately, impacts the valuation of our equity.","So we took all of these things into consideration to move us from where we \u2013 like I said, leaving out that level of three times that we feel very comfortable. It was appropriate with the risk profile of our business. As we have continued to evolve our business, and we can demonstrate the predictability and stability of it, then we have an opportunity to have a, I guess, a more direct impact on the valuation of our stock, when you look at all these three things in combination. It\u2019s not just our balance sheet, but it\u2019s also the opportunity to continue perfecting our platform and returning capital to shareholders in a consistent basis. But Kirk, in terms of specifically these ranges?","Kirk Andrews","Sure, Greg. What I would start with is really the central focus that we always have, which is, we\u2019re focused on driving shareholder value. And you could probably list five or six, but I\u2019m going to use three ways to drive that value. I mean, the first one is disciplined capital allocation. That\u2019s obviously, what we\u2019ve been focusing on. That\u2019s how you build and maintain credibility with our owners at the end of the day. And we, obviously, plan to continue demonstrating that in 2019 and beyond. But more tangibly to state the bloody obvious, certainly, you can increase value by increasing earnings, growing the earnings, growing accretively, growing inorganically. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing. But we\u2019re also mindful of the fact that if you can drive the basis on which the stock is valued at the same time, you\u2019re driving value in two ways, right? And that helps kind of supercharge the value opportunity you have.","Part of the reason, why we\u2019re buying back stock today is, we see it as a compelling investment. It\u2019s a compelling investment just based on traditional valuation metrics in the sector. We believe, we\u2019ve driven the risk profile of this business down, which should command a sea change in how that reduced business profile is reflected in a more robust valuation metric, as I said before. One of the ways, I think that it is a probable to do that is to derisk further the financial side of the balance sheet and that\u2019s obviously reducing the debt.","We\u2019ve taken a look at different free cash flow yields in correlations with different levels of leverage and credit ratings, and there is some pretty compelling evidence across various sectors that basically indicated a strong correlation between those two. And so if we can be successful in driving those metrics down and ultimately, driving that rating up, we believe that\u2019s likely to drive more non-traditional investors in the stock, who are more used to investing in companies with more robust balance sheet. And when we combine that with the continued demonstration, as I said the resilience of our free cash flow, that\u2019s the best means to get that second punch, if you will to drive the stock up.","First part is growing the EBITDA, the second driving the metric at which is valued. And that results \u2013 a strange way to answer a balance sheet question with the equity side of the equation, we\u2019re talking about deleveraging, I\u2019m happy to talk a little bit more about ratings or interest savings or things like that, but I think that\u2019s probably the leading basis on which we\u2019re looking at this change in our value \u2013 rather in our credit metrics.","Greg Gordon","Yes. That makes sense to me. I mean, you\u2019re trading in an equity free cash flow yield approaching 14% and an unlevered free cash flow yield to the EV that\u2019s still close to 12%. And so just getting a couple of 100 basis points improvement in your free cash flow yield is like another $10 to $15 upside in the share price. So I \u2013 that resonates with me. Thank you. I\u2019ll","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Greg. You got it, Greg. You got it.","Greg Gordon","There is lot of questions probably beyond that. So I\u2019ll jump off and go to the back at the queue.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Your question, please.","Angie Storozynski","Good morning, guys. So I have a question about your retail growth, both the margin expansion on the organic basis and M&A. So give us a sense, where you are tracking versus those margin expansion targets that you gave us at the Analyst Day? And also, given that your peer has just announced a major acquisition or big acquisition, how \u2013 and if I understand it correctly, you\u2019re suggesting that you could actually have an M&A in the Retail business as well. How should we think about the whole retail component of your EBITDA going forward? Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, Good morning, Angie. I think you laid out the question well. The way we think about our growth in retail is twofold. One, organic. And we\u2019ve had a lot of success, particularly in the East, but also in Texas of growing our business organically. We\u2019re targeting anywhere between 2% and 4% annual growth on our business. And then the second one is through M&A. And in the past, we\u2019ve said that when you look at our business, although we have made significant strides on rebalancing and rightsizing our portfolio. In the East, our generation business is bigger than our retail. So we\u2019ve been focusing, in trying to grow our retail business in the East. We believe that perhaps the most actionable opportunity today is on the retail side.","We\u2019ve been very, very disciplined in terms of our capital allocation. We have established platform. So for the most part, we\u2019re looking at acquisitions that or opportunities that complement that existing platform. When we think that we can expand the platform like we did in \u2013 with XOOM last year that allows us to enter into the multi-level marketing, we will do that. But our focus is going to be a very disciplined approach on two things, one is, the \u2013 meeting the thresholds, the investment thresholds that we have and that we\u2019ve laid out to all of you. And second one is a very realistic view on the earnings potential of these businesses. I think we have an excellent track record in terms of being disciplined in deploying capital. And two, on delivering what we expect this business will deliver or that we have in our valuations.","Now, in terms of our margin enhancement, I mean, the bulk of the margin enhancement is really around our residential and retail business, although generation and business solutions transform, and we have made good progress. What I can tell you is that we have spent the last 18 months working on these. First, identifying our initiatives then investing. And just in 2018, we\u2019re starting to see the fruits of this. We met our $30 million margin enhancement target. The bulk of it is going to come in, in 2019. That\u2019s where we expect the majority of the impact. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Elizabeth just to give you a quick update on where we are on our mass retail margin enhancement efforts. Elizabeth?","Elizabeth Killinger","Sure. Thank you, Mauricio. Hey Angie, I would summarize a couple of thoughts for you. First on earnings growth between 2017 and 2018, our retail business grew by about 15% in earnings only 3% of that was from XOOM. And on the customer growth side, we grew about 15%, 445,000 customers, most of that was from our M&A activity, but we still have 30,000 customers that we grew organically in the business. So we have a really strong engine. So far, I\u2019m really pleased with the progress on our margin enhancement plans.","You may remember from our Analyst Day, our efforts in the mass side of the business had two primary approaches, one was value expansion and that\u2019s from both retaining more customers. So we\u2019ve implemented predictive analytics tools and enhanced ones that we already had and had been using. We\u2019ve improved our customer experience at multiple tough points from billing to customer care to introducing apps that connect customers to more capabilities. And our value efforts give us better insight to match customers and products and maximize both acquisition and existing customer efforts during a pretty high pressure season for us both with competition and higher supply costs.","And then on the customer growth efforts, that is really exciting. We\u2019ve expanded our channels and our footprint of our face-to-face reach, so that we can meet customers, where they are with compelling products and services in the East. That looks like both in electricity and natural gas portfolio, and we\u2019ve been able to grow that. And we\u2019ve seen double-digit improvements in our key sales metrics, as a result of our growth efforts. So we\u2019re really excited about the progress we\u2019ve made, and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to deliver in 2019.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. I was just wondering how the growth targets that you laid out on the Analyst Day compared now to your outlook given that there\u2019s been probably some increase in the cost-to-serve load as we saw in 2018, probably even more so going forward, you do seem to be a bit short power in Texas. So I mean, again, is this embedded in your projections? Or should I think that that\u2019s actually driving your retail margins going forward?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, if you think about our margin enhancement, that is independent to commodity price increases. I think the best way that I can characterize our margin enhancement is, it just makes our platform better, so regardless of the \u2013 where we are in the cycle now. The reality is when you combine margin enhancement with the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing in the commodity prices, I mean, yes, perhaps you can potentially mass the impact of margin enhancement. But the way we think about margin enhancement is completely independent from the underlying commodity price. And we are on track \u2013 yes, we\u2019re on track for 2019.","Angie Storozynski","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abe Azar from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.","Abe Azar","Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations on achieving your multiple goals for 2018.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Abe.","Abe Azar","No problem. Looking forward, what do you mean by perfected customer-focus business model in your 2019 scorecard?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. So we have gone through great changes inside our portfolio. We rightsize \u2013 first, we simplify the business by taking some non-core assets or underperforming financial assets. We focus on our generation retail integrated business. Then we rightsize it. So our generation portfolio is much better balanced than our retail. But we feel transform regional imbalances for lack of a better word. In the East, our generation portfolio is bigger than our retail. And in Texas, our retail business is slightly bigger than our generation fleet. So I think, there is an opportunity one to better balance those two, that\u2019s what I mean by perfecting it. And then number two, while our physical assets right now are the right ones to help us manage load, there\u2019s always an opportunity. Keep in mind that the customers are going to be determining what is the right mix of the generation assets that we need. When I say, customer-driven integrated platform, I mean it. I mean, the customers are going to determine what kind of supply they want to have. Is there going to be 50% renewables, 75% renewables, 100% grid power. So that\u2019s going to inform how we set off our generation portfolio, and there\u2019s an opportunity to perfect that. So that\u2019s what I mean by perfecting it.","Now, what it means is from a practical standpoint, as I said, there is an opportunity right now to continue growing our retail business both organically and through M&A. But today, I don\u2019t see any opportunity that meets our investment thresholds on the generation side. And that\u2019s why we have initiated this capital-light, asset-light strategy, where we can actually contract short-term or medium-term contracts, PPAs to better manage and perhaps it even better aligns the load obligations that we have. We don\u2019t have. It\u2019s capital-light because we use developers that have perhaps low in terms of capital than we do and have a different risk profile when it comes to the residual value of these assets. And so we think it\u2019s a better match to help us complement our physical asset position. That\u2019s what I mean by perfecting the business.","Abe Azar","Thank you. That makes a lot of sense. That\u2019s all I have today.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Abe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.","Steve Fleishman","Yes. Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on the credit metrics and investment grade. Do you have any sense on if you execute on the metrics in 2019, as you stated just how long it might take the rating agencies to actually make you investment grade, like\u2026","Mauricio Gutierrez","Kirk?","Kirk Andrews","Sure, Steve. I think that\u2019s probably going to be beyond \u2013 certainly beyond 2019 probably based on the dialog we\u2019ve had. Certainly, we\u2019ve enjoyed a lot of success with the rating agencies in the recent past to get them to upgrade us in the last year. So as you know, and understandably, they tend to be a little bit more lagging, they like to do their homework, come around to the new \u2013 both the new business risk profile, as well as the new financial profile. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s going to take a little time. I think that\u2019s fine. It probably will take at least 12 months to 18 months before we can get there.","And part of that, as I said before, is the reason why we\u2019re targeting investment grade metrics is that\u2019s the first step in establishing the platform to get there. I think realistically speaking, and I alluded this in my remarks, we need to continue to demonstrate to the agencies as well as our equity investors that strength and resiliency of the platform because that\u2019s going to be a necessary catalyst over time to get them confident to reduce that business risk. And that\u2019s the reason, why I\u2019m giving it a little longer timeline, which is completely fine because it\u2019s really going to be the combination of, obviously, execute on the delevering, delivering the metrics and then walking that business risk up.","You think both of those are really necessary conditions so that we\u2019re going to get to a here\u2019s the investment grade rating. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, sitting in another region at the BBB minus level is not the right place to be. So if we\u2019re going to take that step and actually target a rating, as I said, we want to be solidly in that range and that\u2019s another reason, why that will take a little bit of time. But I think this puts us on the right path. But it\u2019s important to get at it soon so that we continue to back run to demonstrate that resiliency. And also at the same time on the equity side, trying to drive that valuation metric tighter on that free cash flow yield. So it \u2013 I would say, 12 months to 18 months at a minimum to get through that process.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And just one other question just on the kind of M&A opportunities, which it sounds like would be mainly focused in retail. Just \u2013 obviously, there is one transaction that\u2019s out there that there\u2019s supposedly a competitor process. Is this a \u2013 is there a broad set of opportunities? Or is it more limited to one or two that are out there?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. Steve, I think, there\u2019s just a limited number of opportunities. I mean, limited in the sense of very large retail book. So I think there is going to be a lot of them in terms of small books. But we think of them as the day-to-day, we\u2019re going to be evaluating these, just like we have done in the past, and we\u2019re going to acquire these small books, as a normal course of business. But on the \u2013 let\u2019s say, on the slightly bigger because these are not necessarily large transactions, Steve. There\u2019s a limit in the number of opportunities. And like I said, we are \u2013 we know that we want to participate on this. We have an option to either grow organically or grow through M&A. And just, I mean, we\u2019re just going to be very disciplined.","Very disciplined on two fronts, on the way we look at these businesses and the earnings power of these businesses; and secondly, on the value that we pay for these businesses and the combination of those two are going to \u2013 they have to meet our internal threshold. So I mean, those are the two things that I guess everybody should be thinking about. What do you expect from this business, and what you are willing to pay for this business. And I think we have a pretty good track record in terms of being disciplined on the value side and we\u2019ve been very realistic on delivering the earnings potential of these businesses or the earnings that we tell you, they\u2019re going to deliver.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. So quick follow-up on the credit side. I just wanted to clarify this, the reduction in debt that you\u2019re talking about the $600 million. Just what point in time do you decide to move forward with the \u2013 given the use of your terms that you reserved it in your capital allocation? And then secondly, let me just get this out of the way now two completely separately, but looking at the new hedge disclosures, can you give us a little bit more of an apples-to-apples sense how that looks quarter-over-quarter versus your last set of disclosures? Obviously, you\u2019re changing the numerator and the denominator a little bit here. So it\u2019s all fuzzy in the comparison. But I just wanted to understand incrementally how much more hedged? And kind of when you\u2019re thinking about the shifts here anything to note in terms of the competition or how you\u2019re thinking about it?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. So let me turn it to Kirk for the credit metrics, and then Chris Moser can talk about the hedge.","Kirk Andrews","Hey, Julien. So as far as the timing here, I think, that\u2019s really largely going to be governed by getting at this, what I call, efficiently from a capital perspective. I mean, if you look at our maturity for a second, I\u2019m sort of focused on the unsecured side for a second, given all the successes we\u2019ve had is what I often sort of refer to from time-to-time is we\u2019re kicking cans down the road, we\u2019re making hay while the sun shines and continue to refinance things.","Our nearest maturity is 2024, not surprisingly, it also happens to be our nearest call window. So the next call window we have for that \u2013 or first call window, which is roughly half the coupon, so call it 103, spot of 125 is around May of this year. So if we\u2019re going to go to the unsecured side, I think that\u2019s probably the \u2013 if you want to call it, if you will, the temporal governor there, so that we know we got a price at which we can attack, not necessarily implying 100% certain. That\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going to go, but that\u2019s probably a good way to think about on the unsecured side. By the way, I think that maturity is probably about $730 million, so well enough there to satisfy the $600 million.","The best and most efficient from a capital standpoint is on the foot side of that question. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a pretty significant term loan. That term loan actually matures sooner, that\u2019s in 2023 maturity. That one is available for us to delever at par. So it probably would be right now if you put a gun in my head or a combination of those two things. So that\u2019s probably the two buckets we look most closely to. But in terms of timing, I think about that May inflection point and after is being probably the bulk of that $600 million right now.","Chris Moser","Julien, good morning. Chris here. As far as the hedge disclosures go, listen, we heard from a lot of you that the base load revenue hedge disclosures we used to do were at best insufficient and at worst confusing. So we decided to move to a regional gen portfolio and the full gross margin. In terms of apples-to-apples, you should think of us as that we\u2019ve been scaling sellers in 2020 with a combination of some summer and some around the clock as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. But anything else to consider in the context of your hedging. Do you have disproportionate summer or exposure or any kind of \u2013 when you think about layering those in, is it that a premium or discount versus what you\u2019ve already locked in?","Chris Moser","Yes. I mean, I think that the summer prices have been up slightly between the last disclosure and now. I wouldn\u2019t say materially, if we\u2019re talking about 2020, so to speak. I think that this summer, you got the low reserve margins and high prices. There\u2019s plenty of time for GenOn load to prepare for that. It\u2019s been a little rainy down there so far. And in the most recent way too early weather forecast, I\u2019ve been seen a little bearish Texas in 2019.","I mean, it\u2019s pretty early to get that, but the first seasonal outlook I saw, I think it was from CWG, I\u2019m trying to remember. It had a kind of soft in Texas. I mean, 2020, you\u2019ve got a whole another year of load growth, which, according to the CDR 2,000 megawatts a year, I mean, and that\u2019s peak load growth going from 74.8 to 76.8. It\u2019s \u2013 Texas needs some new generation.","A quick call out, I think, we\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019d like to commend the Public Utilities Commission of Texas for taking the actions they\u2019ve did in terms of adjusting the ORDC out there. I think that\u2019s helpful. Obviously, we support a well-functioning market in Texas. We\u2019ve got way too big in investment down there not to. And I think we\u2019re responding in a bunch of different ways. I mean, we\u2019ve added some reliability work at plants working on some load management and that, and I think that ORDC changes help incent a load response, which is nothing, but helpful for a functioning market.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. I agree about the updated hedges. Thank you very much.","Chris Moser","Awesome. Thanks, Julien.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your question, please.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Hi, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Hi. So quickly just on Slide 23, again on the hedge disclosure. It is helpful, I think to have it this way, so appreciate that. Just wanted to understand, does the chart then imply that for 2020, your hedge pricing is below the current forward curve because you have a 77 million negative on the mark to market. Is that a fair way to read that chart?","Chris Moser","So I think the way to read that is that we\u2019ve been scaling sellers of 2020, as the market has continued to move up.","Praful Mehta","Got you. So there is \u2013 effectively, the price points at which you\u2019re selling or the time of day you\u2019re \u2013 or the \u2013 you\u2019re not selling peak or you\u2019re not locking in hedge pricing that is peak. Is that a fair way to\u2026","Chris Moser","No, no, don\u2019t think about it like that. Don\u2019t think about it like that. Think about that if we sold peak, the peak has moved up since we sold it. And if we sold off peak, the off peak has moved up since we sold it. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re marking it against the relevant numbers.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, It\u2019s a mark-to-market, Praful calculation. So it takes into consideration, where we \u2013 what time of the day, or what, block of energy we sold in the market and then, just marking it against, where the last expectation is or where the forward market is.","Chris Moser","Yes. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not commenting on we sold off peak, but the peak is up. I mean it\u2019s literally what sales that we make compared to where the market is now. And as you\u2019re scaling seller on the market that\u2019s moving up, you would see some mark to market losses, which is what you see on that chart.","Mauricio Gutierrez","And if I can just make a comment because this is a, I think we heard loud and clear from our investors, we want to be very transparent in our disclosures. We want to provide disclosures that help you understand better our company and better the financials going forward. So we believe that moving into these open energy margin with the mark to market of all our hedges, not just power hedges, but all our hedges, just helps you better understand the model the potential \u2013 the earnings potential of our company. So we\u2019re going to continue to provide additional disclosures. But right now, we think that this move is a step on the right direction.","Praful Mehta","Yes, agreed. And I think the mark to market the way you\u2019re describing it exactly is the right way for us to make it easier to read through. So appreciate it. Appreciate the disclosure. And just quickly on the second question, on the credit metrics now that you\u2019re transitioning to more investment grade profile, is that going to go hand in hand with hedge percentages as in, do you add more flexibility to how much you need to hedge going forward? And will that allow you to stay more open if you believe on a fundamental basis that curves don\u2019t reflect the true fundamentals in the 2020 or 2021 timeframe?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, I think Praful what you \u2013 what we \u2013 we don\u2019t look at the credit or the steps that we\u2019re taking on the balance sheet on isolation. I think Kirk already provided a pretty good overview that this is a combination of perfecting our business model and making it more predictable. So you\u2019re just describing what we used to do in the past, which was try to make our generation earnings more predictable. Well, if we are able to now combine it with a more balanced approach to retail, then we don\u2019t have to rely so much on the market. We can just point generation to retail. So one of the key priorities is a more predictable business, which you know, that will improve the assessment of rating agencies and the risk profile of our earnings.","The second thing is the balance sheet and all the benefits that Kirk already explained around the balance sheet. And lastly is consistently returning capital to shareholders. If you think about those three priorities, I think we have a tremendous opportunity given the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves to rerate the stock and to create shareholder value for \u2013 long-term shareholder value in the coming months and years. So it is a combination of all three things that we are looking to enhance the valuation of our equity. I think that\u2019s how you should think about it, they\u2019re all related.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Fair enough. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate it.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Praful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. One question just on the move to investment grade, and then one or two follow-ups. Can you put a cash flow value like an annual cash flow value of, if you\u2019ve got investment grade, what would that mean in terms of either interest cost savings, reduced collateral or something else. I\u2019m just trying to quantify a little bit of what the free cash flow impact of going from sub high grade to \u2013 going from high yield to high grade?","Kirk Andrews","All right, let me take that in two pieces. So the way I think about it, Michael, when you\u2019re telling me some [indiscernible] addressing your question. So step one is that incremental delevering, that will create some cash flow there. So rule of thumb, if you\u2019re talking about reducing interest with fund secured notes, with a coupon of 6, that 600 you\u2019re talking about, $35 million-plus or minus just nice round number 2 to 5.","On an annualized basis, which I think, you find this about a little less than 2% accretive to the free cash flow. Over time, and I want to emphasize over time because that\u2019s the benefit and then the delay that comes with it of all of the success we\u2019ve had as extending maturities tax. When we go to refinance that debt, I think, relative to some investment grade \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re strong BB right now. Kind of rule of thumb, it depends on where the markets are. If you think about maybe 25 basis points type of improvement, could be a little more, could be a little less, but 25 basis points probably a decent rule of thumb.","And we have to keep in mind also that one of the things that comes along with moving to investment grade, which by the way, is one of the other reasons to go to that strong investment grade if you decide to target the ratings is callable debt is no longer available, right? You\u2019re issuing bullets and that\u2019s understandable because it tends to be the case that you\u2019re a lot closer to have the treasuries if you\u2019re less volatile in interest rate environment. But if you ask me if there\u2019s one single cause I can think about it, it\u2019s probably that one. Not really offset by a benefit on covenants because we successfully taken most of the covenants on our unsecured notes to investment grade testing at this point. But again, going back to second part of my answer, yes, roughly 25 basis points plus or minus.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. One question on the hedging. The revenue side, I think relatively easy to kind of back it \u2013 trying to back into that, but just trying to think to the fuel. So can you remind us for the Texas plants, what\u2019s the mix of 8,800 versus 8,400 versus lignite in terms of the coal being used? And kind of similar question for the Midwest gen plants?","Kirk Andrews","So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve broken 8,800 and 8,400 before, but you can assume zero lignite and a mix of the 8,400 and 8,800 for both sets of generation facilities.","Chris Moser","In Texas.","Kirk Andrews","No, in Midwestern.","Michael Lapides","So you\u2019re now using 8,400 because Midwest gen before your acquisition was predominantly 8,800, you\u2019re now using a mix of 8,400 and 8,800. So we should kind of look at where those both respective curves are trading and use some kind of blend between the two?","Chris Moser","Yes. I mean the blend is different in the different regions. But it\u2019s fair to say that the \u2013 it\u2019s all PRB at this point that lignite is out of the question.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then thinking about the Texas coal plants. Just curious, your thoughts on the economics of both limestone and parish given, we\u2019ve seen a little bit move in the forward curves, but given how weak the off peak is, just kind of thought process of the viability of those coal plants and your views on viability of other coal plants in the Texas market and whether there\u2019s another wave of coal plant retirements coming?","Chris Moser","Well, I think it\u2019s fair to say that as you go forward with \u2013 to your point, low off peaks, what you\u2019re seeing is a concentration of value on the peaks and then within the peaks, the concentration of value in the summer as well. And so with high forward summer prices that voice all bodes and certainly the coal plants do well in that scenario as well. If you run out the curve, 10 years or something like that, obviously things look different because it\u2019s a relatively backward dated curve when you get out that far.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. Last item, Agua Caliente, how do you think about the timing of actually being able to do anything with it, just given some of the window comments and cash traps et cetera.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, We are evaluating Agua Caliente, as you know, the expected sale to Clearway didn\u2019t happen, and we\u2019re going to be waiting for a better environment when we monetize that asset. It\u2019s contract is under long-term contracts. And it\u2019s not necessarily fits the profile of our current platform. So I mean we\u2019re going to look out beyond 2019 and evaluate the options. But I think we\u2019re not going to be forced to do something in a challenging environment. We\u2019re going to do it when we think are better times. And just, I mean, just as a way of just additional context, I mean, remember Agua Caliente is not in our 2019 financial guidance. So it really doesn\u2019t have an impact one way or another.","Chris Moser","Hey Michael, I have one more follow-up thought on that. If you look at the shape of the reserve margins, we have \u2013 our version of it on Page 5 there, you see that as you get into 2022 and 2023 that you\u2019re back in that 7% range or something like that. And I would suggest that the pricing in 2022 and 2023 does not reflect a 7% reserve margin. So either the reserve margin is right, in which case the price is wrong or the price is right and the reserve margin is wrong. And so one of those two things had to give. But as of right now, they\u2019re in a state of call it, cognitive dissonance.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your question, please.","Ali Agha","Good morning. Just couple of quick ones. One from a big picture perspective. If I look at the wholesale disclosure, you\u2019ve given us and the trends that you\u2019re showing us 2020 over 2019 and then a load on top of that the margin enhancement plans, you have over 2020 over 2019. So just from a big picture perspective, as we stand today is it fair to say that 2020 EBITDA is probably looking pretty flattish with 2019 that\u2019s the way to think about it?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean I think when you think about 2020, it looks pretty consistent with 2019. Obviously, there\u2019s always puts and takes. In 2020, we have the impact of margin enhancement, the curves are backward dated, so you have more degrees of freedom on your retail. On the generation side, your capacity is under some pressure. But so, I mean there are puts and takes, but it\u2019s pretty consistent year-over-year.","Ali Agha","Got you. And then also to clarify, Mauricio, I think you recently mentioned that Agua Caliente, you said, is not in the 2019 forecast and maybe I misread. But I thought looking at one of your slides, that it included about $40 million of Agua Caliente in 2019? I think it\u2019s Slide 10 footnote? Can you just clarify that?","Kirk Andrews","Yes. Ali, it\u2019s Kirk. That\u2019s distinction that I think we\u2019re making. So I think what Mauricio is referring to is our existing guidance range, which we established on our third quarter call. At that time, our expectation was Agua Caliente would be sold very early in the first quarter. So we did not bake that into our budgeting or forecasting for the year, that\u2019s the basis on which that guidance was established.","Ali Agha","Okay.","Kirk Andrews","Now let me say that why we\u2019ve got the footnote there, right? Now that we know Agua Caliente is not going to be sold, right. It is going to be \u2013 its results will be included in our financial results that\u2019s the distinction between the two.","Ali Agha","Okay. But you didn\u2019t change, I mean, it\u2019s within the guidance range, but are we assuming that it\u2019s accretive?","Kirk Andrews","Sorry, what was that Ali?","Ali Agha","I was just thinking is it additive or is it replacing some other $40 million, so it doesn\u2019t really net-net make any change, I am just clarifying that?","Kirk Andrews","Yes. Well, obviously we\u2019ve got a $200 million range on EBITDA. So certainly over time, the portfolio evolve, right. We reforecast, we take another look at it et cetera, et cetera. So it certainly included as we look at our expectations now going forward, but it\u2019s in the range.","Ali Agha","Got you. And last question. Just to clarify that this $1 billion buyback again is the plan to complete that in calendar 2019 or does that sort of slip into 2020 as well?","Mauricio Gutierrez","No, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re targeting 2019.","Ali Agha","I see. Okay. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Agha.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any further remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Jonathan. It was good talking to all of you. I look forward to continuing our conversation in the days to come. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kevin Cole","Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts.","Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law.","In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I\u2019m joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","I\u2019d like to start the call by highlighting the key messages for the first quarter on Slide 3. First, our business performed well during the quarter and in line with expectations, demonstrating the value of our integrated platform. We\u2019re also reaffirming our 2019 guidance ranges.","Second, our integrated business is well-positioned for summer operations and the fundamentals in our core markets are getting stronger.","Finally, we are on track to achieve our 2019 capital allocation goals, complete our current $1 billion share repurchase program, achieve our new credit metrics by year-end and provide you clarity on the remaining $872 million of excess cash by the third quarter earnings call.","Moving to Slide 4, I want to review the financial and operational results for the quarter. We achieved top quartile safety performance and delivered $333 million of adjusted EBITDA. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have provided our EBITDA on a same-store basis, due to the changes we\u2019ve had in our generation portfolio, either through asset divestitures, retirements or deconsolidations.","Our EBITDA increased by 15% from the same period last year, driven primarily by cost savings, higher realized power prices, partially offset by increases in retail supply costs. It is important to note that the distribution of our earnings has also changed with the third quarter now responsible for a larger percentage of earnings. Recognizing all of these changes, Kirk will provide additional details on the quarterly results in his section.","We continue to make progress on our cost savings and margin enhancement targets. I\u2019m pleased to report that during the first quarter, we achieved $20 million of margin enhancement and that all transformation plan targets remain on track.","We also completed $500 million of our current $1 billion share buyback program during the quarter, repurchasing over 4% of our market cap at an average price of $42.21 per share. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and plan to complete the remainder of the current $1 billion share repurchase program in 2019.","Finally, we are getting ready for summer operations with an expanded spring outage program on our generation fleet and the activation of our summer readiness program across the company. These measures are taken to ensure NRG is able to provide safe and reliable performance during the summer months.","Now turning to our market update on Slide 5. Starting with ERCOT, the supply demand balance remains the tightest it has ever been, following some plant retirements and sustained low growth. The chart in the upper left, which we first introduced on the fourth quarter call, shows how future reserve margins are dependent on new builds, particularly wind and solar.","A closer look at this new capacity for 2020 and 2021 is in the table below. It highlights the lack of viable new builds necessary to keep pace with ERCOT\u2019s 2% annual demand growth. We see limited wind developed, given transmission constraints and a few large gas projects remaining in the CDR have already been delayed by an average of four years.","We do, however, expect the majority of solar to be completed as purchased power agreements are executed, but remain skeptical of significant merchant developments given the economics. Both the PUCT and ERCOT understand the situation and have taken steps to improve the energy-only market to better reflect the scarcity conditions in the system.","We believe these changes will have an impact on forward prices, eventually helping justify the long-term investments necessary to increase the reliability of the system in the long run.","On the right-side of the slide, we highlight our readiness for this summer and the steps we have taken to further strengthen our integrated portfolio. Starting with Retail. We are proactively educating our residential and business customers and providing them with options and tools to manage higher energy bills. We\u2019re also providing energy conservation alerts and enhanced demand management options.","Moving to Generation. As part of our summer readiness program, we are planning to return to service our Gregory plant, which has been offline since the fall of 2016, due to the bankruptcy the esteemed host. This is a 385 megawatt of combined cycle capacity that provides additional reliability to the ERCOT system ahead of the summer.","Last, while our platform today is best positioned to provide more predictable results relative to pure retailers or wholesale generators, we continue to take prudent steps to further enhance our ERCOT business. Given our scalable platform and track record of integrating new businesses, the expected higher volatility in the market creates an opportunity to acquire small to medium-sized customers books and platforms to add value.","And as I discussed last quarter, our Generation or supply business must grow with retail. We are well underway in executing our PPA strategy to complement our physical assets. This strategy allows us to better serve our customers, improves our position management and it is capital-light. I will provide you a more comprehensive update on the next earnings call.","Now moving to the East markets on Slide 6, the focus remains on regulatory changes. Since our fourth quarter call, FERC has directed PJM and NYISO to implement tariff changes for fast start resources. This allows a whole new class of assets to set price. I mean, this is a clear positive for energy price formation in the East.","PJM has also announced its intent to run the 2022, 2023 capacity auction in August under the existing market rules. The timeline for FERC action remains uncertain, but we remain confident that FERC will protect the integrity of competitive markets. We continue to view a strong MOPR of the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of nuclear subsidies in the market.","In ISO New England, a proposal has been put forth that would compensate generators for fuel scarcity. We continue to believe these changes are positive for fuel security reforms overall. However, reform is coming too slowly and the current ISO New England fuel security proposal pending at FERC is insufficient. We look forward to working with the ISO on this matter.","Moving to the right-side of the slide, we highlight the strength and diversification of our Northeast portfolio. Our existing portfolio is primarily large capacity and fuel-resilient generation located in key load centers and provides a solid foundation for continued growth of our retail business in the region.","While the regulatory activities in the region provide some uncertainty, we\u2019re optimistic about these regulatory outcomes and more importantly, believe our integrated [Technical Difficulty] well-suited to succeeding the region.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio. Starting with the summary of financial results you find on Slide 8, consolidated first quarter EBITDA was $333 million, with $153 million from Retail and $180 million from Generation. The bar charts in the center of the slide provide a walk from our first quarter 2018 consolidated EBITDA to this quarter\u2019s results.","Starting on the left-side of this chart, we start with first quarter 2018 consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $336 million. Next, in order to arrive in an appropriate basis for comparison to 2019, we eliminate the impact of asset sales, retirements and deconsolidations from our first quarter 2018 results.","The total EBITDA impact of these items is $47 million and is comprised of four elements. One, Ivanpah and Agua Caliente, which were fully consolidated in our first quarter 2018 results before circumstances required to change in accounting later in 2018 to equity method; second, BETM, which was included in our first quarter 2018 results, but was sold later in the year; third, the pro forma impact of the Cottonwood lease, which began in early 2019 following the sale of the South Central Portfolio; and finally, EBITDA from the Encina facility, which was retired when the Carlsbad plant was brought online at the end of 2018 and sold to Clearway.","Deducting the $47 million impact of these items from first quarter 2018 results provides a baseline for comparison to our reported results for this quarter. From this new baseline, we address the quarter-to-quarter changes starting with three elements related to the Transformation Plan initiatives.","First, we incurred $15 million in incremental SG&A expense related to margin enhancement programs, we expect to begin to produce results later in 2019. Next, we realized $20 million in EBITDA from our margin enhancement programs during the first quarter; and third, having delivered $80 million in Transformation Plan cost savings in the first quarter of 2018, we realized $130 million in savings this quarter or an incremental increase in savings of $51 million.","Turning to Retail. Non-transformation Plan retail results for the quarter were $58 million lower, primarily due to increased supply cost and more favorable weather in the first quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by EBITDA from the XOOM acquisition.","Finally, Generation results for the quarter were $46 million higher, primarily due to higher realized prices during the quarter. Both the higher retail supply costs and higher realized prices in Generation are in part the result of intersegment power sales between Generation and Retail, which are typically based on average annual power prices.","As power prices in ERCOT have become increasingly seasonal with lower prices during the shorter periods, such as the first quarter and higher prices during the summer, the resulting annual average price implies a premium to observe pricing in the shoulder periods and a discount to pricing seen in the summer.","The annual supply costs for Retail and annual revenues from Generation, which result from these intercompany sales based on average annual prices, will be no different than if those intercompany transactions were executed based on quarterly or seasonal pricing, since these prices form the basis for the annual average price used. As our consolidated results of $333 million for the quarter were in line with our expectations, we\u2019re reaffirming our 2019 guidance ranges.","Turning to Slide 9. While our capital allocation plan for 2019 is unchanged from our previous update, we have now completed the first-half of our $1 billion 2019 share buyback program we announced in late February and will continue to repurchase shares to complete the balance of that program.","We continue to expect $872 million of yet to be allocated excess capital in 2019, which will become available later this year as we generate the bulk of our free cash flow during the third quarter. We expect to provide an update on the intended use of that excess capital by our third quarter earnings call.","Finally, we remain focused on our revised target investment-grade metrics in 2019, as shown on Slide 10, and are on track to achieve those metrics, including using up to $600 million in 2019 capital previously allocated to further reduce balance sheet debt.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to you, Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Kirk. Now turning to Slide 12, a few closing thoughts on our 2019 priorities and expectations. I\u2019m very excited for 2019 with another year of strong execution. Our top priority is to further demonstrate the predictability of our integrated platform, achieve our new investment-grade credit metrics and deploy the nearly $900 million of remaining excess cash adhering to our transparent capital allocation principles.","We also remain on track on all of our Transformation Plan targets, particularly as we continue to ramp up our margin enhancement initiatives throughout 2019. Our company today is stronger than it has ever been. And as I look to the summer and beyond, I\u2019m confident our platform is best positioned to deliver predictable results and create significant shareholder value in the long run.","So with that, I want to thank you for your interest in NRG. Danielle, we\u2019re now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, team.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, so wanted to follow-up on a couple of quick things if you don\u2019t mind. First, perhaps this is more of a financial detail question, on the allocation question that you just raised across the year. What does that mean for the balance of the year, specifically looking at third quarter more from a year-over-year perspective as you think about it? Should we expect more of a positive impact on 3Q than you would have otherwise expected for the Retail segment specifically this year?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, if you think about it now with the changes in our portfolio, the distribution of our earnings are now peak year for the summer months. And particularly, with the intersegment, I mean, you\u2019re going to see an average impact of the prices. While prices have increased in Retail, I guess, power prices have increased for the entire year just given the peakiness of the summer, you\u2019re going to see that impact in our results. Kirk?","Kirkland Andrews","Yes, I think, I agree with that on \u2013 in isolation. When it comes specifically to the impact of the intercompany transfer, the dynamic that Mauricio described is correct from a standpoint of year-over-year supply cost, specifically related to that transfer. Overall, certainly, as you know, one, the third quarter in \u2013 on a consolidated basis is increasingly, as Mauricio said, the strongest contributor by far to our results.","And so overall, you may see the overall comparison on Retail and Generation in that quarter overall being similar to the directions that you see on Slide 8 for the first quarter. But within that, going back to what I said in the first place, the supply cost related to the intercompany transfer will have the opposite comparison, as you indicated. But there\u2019s obviously a lot more than just intercompany transfer they contribute to our results. So, we certainly expect Generation to be relatively robust and just the overall EBITDA to be more significant than any other quarter of the year, it is \u2013 typically it\u2019s in the third.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes, absolutely. Following back to more of the fundamental, the core business. Can you provide a little bit more of your thoughts on what the impact of full FRR would be to the Midwest Gen Portfolio. I appreciate that you\u2019ve provided some Reg G segment specific disclosure, but it would be curious on how you think about that in financial impact and potential other plant decisions out in the four years?","And then separately, Mauricio, can you elaborate very quickly on your commentary about procurement and renewal procurement, potentially later this year?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Sure. Well, let me start first with the impact of full FRR. And I\u2019m assuming that your question is just specific about Illinois and the impact that it has in our Midwest Generation Portfolio.","So, before I turn it over to Chris for additional details, let me just say that, first, you have to put it in context. I don\u2019t think that outcome is a binary outcome, where one looses and the other one wins. We know that our Generation is needed for the common zone to maintain or to meet the expected load.","With respect to the FRR, I mean, the states have always have the right to FRR completely if they wanted to. The specifics about how this time around will be done is less clear. There is a lot of a speculation whether certain units can FRR, whether the entire market needs to FRR, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 there are a couple of considerations there. Remember, Illinois has retail choice, so it will be very difficult to FRR the entire region.","But regardless of what the path that they take, we feel very comfortable that under the status quo, we are okay. If they decide \u2013 if FERC decides to implement some sort of RCO, resource carve-out with repricing, I think, we\u2019re better off. And if they decide to go ahead FRR, we don\u2019t have enough information to assess what the impact would be, but it\u2019s not zero since our units are needed.","But with that, Chris, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else that you want to add.","Chris Moser","No, I would \u2013 Julien, this is Chris. I would echo what Mauricio said, which is the details are going to matter and which path FERC ends up taking at Illinois, ends up taking are going to matter. What I will just echo is that, hey, look, in a 25,000 megawatts zone, they still need a big chunk of our units to clear that zone and to cover the load reliably.","So I know that we outlined kind of the impact of Midwest Gen, what percent it is of our earnings in earlier calls and\/or presentations. And I would say, I would expect that anything \u2013 any impact would be a fraction of that.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve said that in \u2013 approximately, it\u2019s about somewhat 5% of our total EBITDA. So let\u2019s just put it in context what the impact would be. But again, I think the important thing, this is not a binary outcome, a zero-sum game.","With respect to your second question about the PPAs, we introduced our capital-light PPA strategy in the last earnings call. That team has made really good progress. We\u2019re in the middle of executing that right now, but we\u2019re not done yet. So where I\u2019m going to be providing you the more specifics around the progress on that strategy by the next earnings call, because as you hope, you can appreciate, we\u2019re in the middle of execution, and I don\u2019t want to impair our ability to get the best value on those \u2013 on that strategy.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you, all.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is now open.","Greg Gordon","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Just looking at the math here on the cost saves, it appears to me and I just wanted to confirm this that you had $532 million achieved in 2018. And the slide deck shows you have $51 million incremental achieved in Q1. So the targets $590 are basically at $583, so that would corroborate your view that you\u2019re pretty much on point on getting to the cost saves, right? Am I reading that correctly?","Kirkland Andrews","Yes. I think, overall, that \u2013 that\u2019s a reasonable way to interpret in term \u2013 in terms of the uptick. That is the case with respect to certain portions of the cost savings is, they aren\u2019t realized on a levelized basis across the year, because in some of our costs, specifically on the \u2013 especially on the O&M side are seasonal in nature.","So you\u2019ll see variability in realized cost savings quarter-over-quarter. But going back to your original observation, yes, the incremental increase is a good barometer to see the measure that we are on track towards getting to that $590 run rate in 2019, which is embedded in our guidance.","Greg Gordon","Great. And it\u2019s a little bit difficult to suss out from your slides, where you are on a gross margin basis for the year relative to the target, because you give us now, you\u2019re giving us 2Q 2019 through 4Q 2019 expectation of $1.025 billion on Page 19. But it\u2019s hard to compare that with the original guidance that was given of $1.176 billion in the Q4 deck just because you didn\u2019t give us what you actually achieved in Q1. But is it \u2013 it\u2019s fair \u2013 is it fair to say that, you haven\u2019t called anything out there, so that you\u2019re still on track to hit that gross margin target?","Kirkland Andrews","Overall to that question is, yes. As I said, the quarterly results of $333 million, as I said, were in line with our expectations. And you\u2019re right, I mean, the realized gross margin, which I think you\u2019ll find we\u2019ll be filing the Q later today with the details around the MD&A with a gross margin is by segment.","So that when combined with the outlook over the balance of the year as you cited on 2019, would be the best way to confirm that. But overall, your overarching statement is correct. We are on track and that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re reaffirming the guidance today.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Last question, and this is a bit of a specular one, so I appreciate it if you delivered it and how you can answer it. If we have a super volatile summer in Texas this year, given that your book is, for the most part balanced, would it be your expectation that that\u2019s sort of a theoretically significant upside opportunity for the company, or do you think that the opportunity to generate significantly higher wholesale margins, but that the retail performance will sort of balance that out, and you might do a little better, but you\u2019re not really a net long in the market, right? Is it your goal to just be able to consistently deliver operating results in all types of market environments with limited volatility rather than sort of position to get a one-time benefit from a volatility event?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. Well that is exactly what I was about to say, Greg. Our goal in rebalancing the portfolio and integrating Generation and Retail is to be able to provide predictable earnings in a number of market conditions. So if there is an extreme scenario in Texas, let me just, I guess, provide a little bit more specificity. All our price load is hedged. So by \u2013 when we go into the summer months, you have to know that our retail exposure will be completely hedged.","On the Generation side, we always carry a little bit of excess generation to manage operational risk. So to the extent that our units perform well, we\u2019re going to have more that is exposed to the market. And if you see really high prices, we\u2019ll benefit from that. If our units operate less, we have a buffer to be able to manage that and not be exposed to high power prices.","So overall, the goal of the \u2013 the goal for us in the summer and for that matter on any season is to continue providing predictable earnings with these complementary and countercyclical businesses of Generation and Retail.","Greg Gordon","Okay. But it sounds like the way that you\u2019ve hedged your book, a volatility event would allow you to run the assets that where you do have length at higher load factors and higher prices. And so they\u2019re \u2013 and given that you\u2019re hedged on the Retail side, there actually might be a modest benefit to the overall system performance?","Kirkland Andrews","Yes. Greg, I would say, modest benefit is probably the better way to think about that. And certainly, within that bandwidth of reasonable scenarios, as Mauricio said, it depends on the load that we have not yet locked in and priced, right?","We have \u2013 there\u2019s two determining factors there. One is the price to the customer of that load and we\u2019re obviously very sensitive to that, because we\u2019re in a business of maintaining our customer base; and two, is the supply cost you realize when you lock that in, right? Obviously, the latter of those two scenarios is going to be driven by the evolution of prices in ERCOT, which on the other side of the equation benefit Generation, but it all depends on where we lock those prices on the Retail side.","So I\u2019m painting a picture of a scenario where, yes, you\u2019ll realize some benefit on the length on the Generation side, but some of that may be offset by supply cost in the Retail side. We said, if we decide, it is like [indiscernible] for the long run to maintain discipline in the near-term on price where Retail is concerned.","Chris Moser","And Greg, this is Chris. I would just throw out one thing that is slightly more medium-term than what happens this summer if it\u2019s super volatile. I think in a super volatile summer, you may see some retailers that aren\u2019t as well capitalized or hedged as us that end up shaken loose that, we do have Elizabeth and her team does a great job of buying and moving things into the book. And so that may provide an opportunity for us to grow the retail side, if we do see what you described as super volatile this summer.","Mauricio Gutierrez","And super volatile will also impact next summer or the following summer, which gives us an opportunity to increase our hedges and capture higher gross margins on our generation part of the business.","Greg Gordon","Very detailed answer, guys. Thank you. Have a great morning.","Kirkland Andrews","Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you. Good talking to you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Angie.","Angie Storozynski","Good morning. On the Retail side, just wondering given the stress moves. Are you still considering third-party M&A on the Retail side? And could it be actually a larger transaction? Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. Angie, I mean, as you know, we don\u2019t comment on M&A. But we have said that we\u2019ve come a long way on rebalancing our portfolio between Generation and Retail. I feel very good about it, but there\u2019s always an opportunity to perfect it. I have said that before in the past. Our focus right now is, how do we grow our Retail business in the East.","We have a really good platform. We have been doing it organically, very successfully. But the way I would characterize the M&A opportunities are probably smaller to medium-size and they\u2019re limited. So we\u2019re going to be very opportunistic and we\u2019re going to be very judicious about where we deploy our capital on the space. And this has to be \u2013 they have to be businesses that just complement our existing platform.","We already have a platform in the \u2013 in Texas. We already have a platform in the East. So this is really a tuck-in transaction for a lack of a better word. So they\u2019re smaller and medium size.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And then the second question, you mentioned the progress on your buyback plan. When can we hear about the update for the remainder of the year? How much more money you plan to dedicate to buyback?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. So the remaining cash of $872 million. As you all know, we already allocated $1.6 billion, that\u2019s mostly on returning capital to shareholders and to achieve our new credit metric investment type of metric ratios. So I will be in a position to provide that by \u2013 in the third quarter earnings call.","As I said, this was kind of a unique year, because a lot of our excess cash was front-loaded given the asset sales. And now that the distribution of our earnings have become even more peak here in the summertime. We really need to wait for \u2013 the \u2013 having that excess cash, I guess, coming through the door before we can allocate it.","So you should expect that from us on the third quarter earnings call anytime. So how we\u2019re going to allocate that? We\u2019re going to be consistent with the way we have allocated that on our capital allocation principles. We look at growth and we look at returning capital to shareholders.","We have a very clear and transparent way of measuring our \u2013 the return hurdles that we have when we allocate for growth, but that\u2019s not sufficient. They also have to be superior to the \u2013 I guess, implied return of our own shares that we believe continue to be undervalue. So I think, we\u2019re going to be very consistent in the way that we have approach it in the past.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Hey, good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Hi. Just a clarification on the buyback. The $500 \u2013 the $400 million that you did with the bank accelerated repurchase, do you know if all that stock actually got bought by now in the market, or is some of that still to be bought?","Kirkland Andrews","No, we know that at the quarter-end and you\u2019ll see this when we file the Q later today. That program was still outstanding, but subsequently to the quarter-end, I think, September and mid-April. The bank completed that accelerated share repurchase program and we\u2019ll deliver the balance of the share, so that program\u2026","Steve Fleishman","Okay. So that\u2019s in your average price of buying and everything that part of it?","Kirkland Andrews","Yes, that\u2019s correct, it\u2019s reflected.","Steve Fleishman","Yes.","Kirkland Andrews","Even at the first quarter-end event, it\u2019s reflected in that. And I I believe on one of those pages in the press release, there\u2019s a footnote that tells you what our shares outstanding are up to the minute and that shares outstanding reflects the complete impact of that first $500 million [indiscernible].","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And just \u2013 maybe just a little more color on Texas for this summer. And just I know you brought this plant back, which you did not do last summer. So I assume that suggest it\u2019s even tighter in your view than last summer. Just how \u2013 what\u2019s your sense on the risk of major volatility events price spikes or things like that, just any further color for this summer?","Chris Moser","I mean, as you will know a lot more when we get to next week and they come out with the SARA and the CDR, which I think is coming out Wednesday or Thursday of next week on 8th date, that is \u2013 that will give us a look. I expect that to show probably negatives in the base case. It doesn\u2019t, okay?","But keep in mind that SARA normally doesn\u2019t count the full use of the D.C. tied. It doesn\u2019t count all of the ERS or the private used networks. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of things that are above and beyond the SARA. But it\u2019s going to look pretty bad. I mean, the seven and change reserve margin is going to be awfully tight.","Going the other way, Gregory will be in there, so you\u2019ll see a slight uptick from that. But in terms of what we\u2019re seeing so far this summer and so far what we\u2019ve seen this spring, we\u2019ve had some disappointing days, where the expectations were pretty high from a hey load is pretty good and we\u2019ve got a heck of a lot of averages and you do kind of a net load calculation and you\u2019re like wow we\u2019re up in the middle of 70s and prices aren\u2019t doing much. It\u2019s been raining down there at the drought monitor.","People start to look at the drought monitor around this time of the year, and we\u2019ll see what that shows. But it\u2019s been relatively wet down there and looking at it. And so forward reading, it looks like we\u2019re leaning towards El Ni\u00f1o, which isn\u2019t particularly bullish. But we\u2019ll have to see and, like I said, we\u2019ll take a look at the SARA when it comes out. But hey, look, at 7.5 reserve margin super tight, but a lot of the other things are going are kind of trending the other direction.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Kirkland Andrews","Yes, take care.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Hey, good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Good morning. So maybe first a detailed question on Page 33, where you have your free cash flow for the year \u2013 for the quarter. This seems to be a big working capital collateral draw, which has reduced your free cash flow before growth for the quarter. I just want to understand why the $384 million? What\u2019s kind of driving that? And how does that trend down over time?","Kirkland Andrews","That\u2019s basically just collateral postings related to two things. One, the components of collateral postings related to the mark-to-market on our hedges that we put in place. That collateral comes back to us, obviously, as those hedges roll off and realize is the case over the course of the year. And also to some extent, working capital receivables versus payables around the context of the Retail business. I think, this is probably the two primary components of that.","I mean, if you follow the company, I know that you have. I mean, the first quarter tends to be our light quarter on a free cash flow basis. This is not unusual at all for us, because even though there\u2019s an EBITDA distribution here, I would say, even the free cash flow is even more acutely biased towards that, kind of third quarter piece of the year.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. Thanks for that color. And then maybe a little bit on Texas, again. It sounds like while the reserve margin is tight, the other conditions, especially weather and if it\u2019s wet, clearly, it won\u2019t be that beneficial. But as I understand your previous comments, it sounds like most of the benefit that you expect to get out of a tight Texas is more true hedging in the forward curve and the actual event during the summer itself may not be that beneficial, because you don\u2019t have that much Generation open. Is that a fair way to understand how you look at Texas at this point?","Mauricio Gutierrez","I mean, I think that\u2019s fair. If you look even at our hedging disclosures for the balance of the year, we\u2019re 93%, 94% hedged. So, we really have \u2013 our excess generation is really going to be with an eye towards managing our operational risk. And \u2013 but if there is high prices this summer, it will definitely impact forward years, and that just gives us a really good opportunity, where our portfolio is more open.","I mean, if you look at 2020, we\u2019re only 50% hedged and 2021. So it creates an opportunity for hedging in the future and it creates \u2013 now there is a modest upside. But again, our goal is to make sure that our platform performs on a number of market conditions.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. That\u2019s super helpful context. And then finally, just on PJM, with this fast track reform, it sounds like \u2013 I just want to get your view on has that had moved yet in terms of is it reflected in the forward curve? Do you see some bullish impact already, or do you expect to see it later down the road? How do you see this fast track reform to actually impact prices?","Chris Moser","I think it\u2019s been \u2013 this is Chris. I think it\u2019s been slightly muted by the change between what PJM was asking for and what FERC delivered. And also I think that there was \u2013 I think there was a little bit in the forward curve to begin with. I mean, this has been sitting there. We were expecting this to happen in September. So this has been in the forwards for this summer for a while. Will \u2013 I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to \u2013 I don\u2019t expect the curves to run up $3 on this, would be my suggestion.","Praful Mehta","Yes, I mean, that\u2019s exactly. We didn\u2019t see that much move, so I just wanted to get the context, so that\u2019s why I\u2026","Chris Moser","I think it was mostly expected and then slightly disappointed that FERC didn\u2019t do exactly what PJM asked, which was the two hour, instead of a one hour.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. Well, I really appreciate it, guys. Thank you.","Chris Moser","Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Praful.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. An ERCOT renewable question for you, which is the Q in ERCOT for solar, I think, continues to grow. And obviously, a small percentage of what\u2019s in the Q will likely get built. But how do you think about what \u2013 for your base case, like given how big the Q is? What you guys are assuming actually gets built when you think about what the market looks like two, three, four years from now?","Chris Moser","So the is Chris, Mike. I would look and say, I think, we probably shared this in the past that when we look at wind build in the CDR versus what we see wind delivered, it\u2019s been in that 30% to 40% range over the past three years or so. So I would be slightly bearish even to that, because I think that Greg [ph] pretty well supplied with 22 gigs of wind already on the system and the Greg was built for far less than that.","When you then talk about solar, I think that we\u2019re going to see some solar coming. I think that Texas needs new build right now, because good load, the peak load is growing at 2,000 megawatts a year. And so we need a bunch of a \u2013 a bunch of new build and solar seems like the most likely part of it assuming they can find PPAs for that.","So that\u2019s kind of a quick, and then there\u2019s very little gas really. I mean, I think gas is only 10% or 15% of the interconnection queue these days. And like Mauricio mentioned in his initial remarks, I mean, some of the gas that is expected in 2021 has been postponed three or four times already. So that\u2019s a real quick snapshot on it.","Michael Lapides","Yes. And when you think about where the utility scale solar will come, am I right in thinking about it that it will be unlike the wind in West Texas, the utility scale solar has the potential to be a lot closer to the load pockets? I\u2019m just trying to think about what \u2013 if we get several gigawatts in the next two to three years of total new installed, how you\u2019re thinking about the impact on kind of future pricing?","Chris Moser","I think that solar sighting is going to be sprinkled across the grid. So as opposed to like a very concentrated approach out in the panhandle that we\u2019ve seen in the wind. I think solar will speckle the landscape a lot more, so to your point, may be closer to some of the load zones.","And then impact on pricing, I\u2019ll just leave you with this thought. There\u2019s no unit in the system that\u2019s a $9,000 cost, right? I mean, the prices are administratively set. So whether whether the unit is zero marginal cost like solar or a $30 gas unit, it doesn\u2019t really matter when you get to scarcity. And the \u2013 if we need a lot to get to a 10% reserve margin in 2021, and I don\u2019t think a lot of that winds probably going to be there to do that. So I think it\u2019s going to stay tight for a while.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Chris Moser","You\u2019re welcome, Michael.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Michael, and thank you for your interest in NRG, and I look forward to talking to you in the next earnings call or in a roadshow if I see you before that.

We are grateful for his many contributions to the Company for over a decade. And I want to wish him well in his next endeavors.","Today is my first time, addressing you as CEO of NRG. So, I\u2019m going to deviate slightly from our normal earnings agenda because I want to use this time to not only report on the results of our business, which were exceptional, but also to give you my perspective on the strategic direction of the Company and our immediate priorities.","So, let\u2019s begin on slide four, where I have outlined the key messages you should take away from today\u2019s call. First, as our financial performance has shown time and time again, we have the right portfolio and the right platform to succeed in this environment. Our business delivers strong results, during periods of low prices and importantly, our generation fleet remains significantly levered till market recovers.","Second, in this environment, we will benefit from having a stronger balance sheet. We have initiated a comprehensive plan to reduce debt, streamline costs, and replenish capital. We are proactively doing this to take advantage of market opportunities in the short-term, so we can benefit from a market recovery in the medium to long run.","Third, in order to afford ourselves maximum flexibility on our capital allocation decisions, we are recalibrating our dividend to be consistent with the capital intensive and cyclical nature of our industry.","Finally, we are focused on bringing the GreenCo process to a closure that maximizes value for our shareholders. We are reintegrating business renewables back into the NRG platform with no change to our financial guidance and reinforcing our strategic relationship with NRG Yield. We are continuing to sell process of EVgo and NRG Home Solar. All of these actions support our objective to continue building and operating the best integrated competitive power company.","Now, let me elaborate in more detail.","Starting on slide six with the financial performance of our business, I am very pleased to report that we achieved the upper range of our adjusted EBITDA guidance in 2015, despite the challenging power markets, a company-wide restructuring, and changes in management. We remained focused on our business and delivered top quartile safety business with our retail business having a record year, demonstrating the consistency and value of our integrated platform. So, to every one of my colleagues, job well done.","There are a few points that I want to highlight. We are reaffirming 2016 financial guidance, which now includes our business renewables. Our commercial team continues to execute superbly and have mitigated the impact of lower prices for the year. We are off to a good start on our plan to strengthen the balance sheet. Since November, we have retired close to $700 million in high-yield debt at a significant discount bar. We are expanding this by an additional $925 million of debt reductions, which Kirk will cover in more detail.","We remain focused in replenishing capital with $500 million in targeted asset sales in 2016 and we are accelerating our cost savings timeline. And as I mentioned before and something I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, we are reducing the annual dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.15 per share, which afford us maximum flexibility in our capital allocation program, during this market period.","Let me now move to the strategic part of the presentation and provide you my perspective on where NRG\u2019s today and what I believe separate us from others in our industry. Stakeholders repeatedly tell me that NRG story and capital structure is too complicated about the company\u2019s spending too much money on businesses that are outside of its core competencies. I have taken this seriously and I am here today telling you that simplification of our business is an imperative, both for external perception and internal focus.","Efforts are already under way to address this concern. Everything from the way NRG\u2019s preceding the market to the way we disclose information, to the way we run our platform will be greatly simplified over the next several quarters. Simplification starts with the way that we think about the business. The graphic on the left side of slide seven represents our thinking. NRG has and continues to be comprised of two main businesses, generation, inclusive all renewable; and retail. That is our focus and there should be no mistake about that. But, it is not only these two businesses independently that create a most value for NRG, it is the interaction between the two through our scalable operating platform.","This is truly a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The plus points between our generation and retail businesses underpin the NRG value for position. A generational fleet that is well diversified in terms of location, merit-order and fuel price minimizing exposure to downturns in any one market, but flexible enough to benefit from specific areas like we saw during the polar vortex, a complementary business model that helps insulate revenues from commodity risks.","Today, two-thirds of our economic gross margin comes from sources that are counter or non-correlated to gas, like retail; capacity revenues or long-term contracts. A cash flow machine, even in what has become a very difficult commodity cycle that is enhanced by our ability to replenish capital through NRG Yield. While I believe it\u2019s not fully appreciated, much to our own doing is the shared and scalable platform that we have built. Our ability to leverage our common platform to grow our business and realize cost synergy in the processes absolutely unique in this industry. And not only is it unique but later in the presentation, I\u2019ll explain why I think it is necessary to succeed. In summary, my view of the business is that it\u2019s simple, focused and differentiated within the competitive power space.","Turning now to slide eight, I want to take a step back and give you my perspective on the competitive power industry and what I believe it takes to be successful. This industry\u2019s currently undergoing a paradigm shift. We are in periods of sustained low natural gas prices, load growth that has slowed in most markets except Texas and the Gulf Coast, [indiscernible] technologies are coming on to the grid, changing traditional dispatch, market growths are focused on reliability, particularly in the face of retirement, renewables continue to enter the market as regulation focuses on limiting emissions from conventional power. Being a pure IPP player is no longer enough to succeed in the market today and defiantly not tomorrow. The company that can successfully navigate all the risks and changes in the competitive power industry is one that is diversified, not only in terms of its generation portfolio, but also in terms of its business line. It is too easy for any one fuel type or any one business line to experience turmoil or disruption in the current shifting market.","As I mentioned before, the operational platform has become a value differentiator and to a great extent, a source of incremental revenue. Operational excellence is always non-negotiable, regardless of the industry. But in ours, building an operational platform that enables economies of scale is even more fundamental. For NRG, this operational platform has become a differentiated means of margin enhancement, as complementary businesses intersect and create opportunities for companies to startle different markets. But this is just the foundation. In the competitive power industry, companies need to remain leveraged to the upside by constantly assessing the markets and the economic viability of opportunities to grow the businesses in a disciplined manner, as markets evolve. For me, this means investing in areas where you can have a competitive advantage. It does not mean trying to be everything to everyone.","Last, I believe financial discipline needs to be a top priority for companies in our sector. It is not prudent to take a myopic approach to managing the balance sheet and capital allocation. These decisions must be made on a portfolio level, looking at all parts of the business and align decision making with current market opportunities.","So, how do we start up against these principles? I have already stressed how pleased I am with the operational execution across the business within NRG. We have made great strides in diversifying our business and revenues to protect us from low natural gas and power prices. At the same time, we remain well-positioned for growth, looking for low cost development opportunities and to monetize assets through our static relationship within NRG Yield. These unique attributes, position NRG for sustained success in the industry.","As you saw in the earlier slides, we have identified cost control and financial discipline, as one of our key opportunities for improvement. While we have already begun a period of cost savings, I still believe we can do more. And I am actively working with the teams to uncover new opportunities.","Our other area of focus will be in how we approach capital allocation and how we manage our capital structure. I want to make sure that our capital decisions meet with the current and near term market cycles. We plan to be transparent in our capital allocation. And there should be no head scratching when it comes to how we deploy capital. And on that note, our focus right now needs to be on deleveraging the business to ensure we stay ahead of this market cycle, so we can take the advantage of the opportunities that will result from it. We have already made significant progress and we will continue to do so until we see market conditions change.","As we just discussed, NRG operates a large and well-diversified integrated portfolio with assets that are environmentally well-controlled. While it is important to have a good foundation, there is no one size fits all approach when it comes to regional dynamics.","On the slide nine, we outlined what I refer to as our go-to-market strategy that reflects each of our regions, specific trends and market dynamics. In the East region, it\u2019s all about reliability or capacity revenues. We have seen system-operators support for capacity products that reward reliability and performance, particularly in the face of retirements and weather events such as the polar vortex. For example, in the first capacity performance auction in PJM, we cleared close to 90% of our fleet and increased capacity revenues by 80% over the next three years. We are about to finish the repositioning of our portfolio to shift our margin mix from energy to capacity, via fuel conversations, which reduces operating costs significantly and environmental retrofits to maintain a cheap option on key assets to capitalize on higher power prices.","In the Gulf, we continued to benefit from our integrated platform in this lower price environment where our retail operation continues to over perform. Let me just say that our retail business in Texas is virtually impossible to replicate due to its scale and linkage with generation. We have demonstrated the value of our retail franchise for the past seven years with 2015 being our best year yet. This is a key differentiator of ours and one that we will continue to focus on, and grow.","Our generation fleet has the scale and environmental controls needed to sustain this weak price environment, where we should see further supply rationalization. At the same time, there is still the potential for the market to self-correct and be enhanced by improvements in market structure and feed pricing.","The West region is a story of renewables and distributor resources, and maintaining a capacity fleet that supports the grid, given the intermittent nature of these resources. There is a need for quick start, well-located assets. And that is exactly what NRG has been successful in that market. Securing contracted assets and developing sites in favorable locations that can then be monetized through NRG Yield, providing us a long-term dividend payment. So far, we have developed over 1,800 megawatts of quick start generation and won nearly 800 megawatts of repowering at our Carlsbad and Puente sites. We have been successful in growing our renewable and distributor portfolio and with the reintegration of the renewables group into NRG, this will continue to be a growth area.","Now, turning to slide 10, we remain focused on streamlining the organization. I am pleased with our efforts in taking close to $350 million in costs out of the system, but I am not satisfied and we continue to look for more. So today, I am announcing an accelerated timeline for our target cost savings of $150 million under our core NRG continuous improvement process, which has yielded so many benefits across the organization over the years. We expect this EBITDA accretive cost savings to be realized through end of 2017.","Additionally, we continue to prune our portfolio to bring incremental capital back into the Company. We have executed on $138 million in asset sales thus far and are on track with our $500 million target. Last, we are nearing the completion of our current generation fleet modernization program, which reduces our CapEx commitment by nearly $650 million in 2017, providing us additional flexibility on capital allocation in the next five years.","Moving on to slide 11, I know there has been a lot of questions about my perspective on renewables and how this relates to the GreenCo process that we announced late last year. Let me be clear. As the CEO of not only the largest competitive generation owner in the country, but also one of the largest renewable companies, I recognize that this market represents a significant development opportunity, given said renewable targets, customer needs, our competencies and financial incentives, and it is one in which we must participate. However, I am committed to ensuring that our efforts in this area match our skills and capabilities and are executed in a way that is value-creating for shareholders. I am mindful of what has and continues to be a very deliberate process around GreenCo to determine the best way to create value in these business areas.","So, let me summarize where we are now. First, from here on out, we will no longer refer to GreenCo, as described in our September update call. As we think about the individual business strategies moving forward, it no longer makes sense to group them under one headline. Not all renewable businesses are viewed the same in terms of fit and value for NRG.","Today, I am announcing the reintegration of our traditional NRG business. Everything but the utility scale, since that was never part of the GreenCo process, back into the Company to ensure we\u2019ll maintain our advantage position and skills to participate in the changing landscape of the power industry. It is important to recognize that many of our C&I customers expect us to be able to integrate renewables on and offsite. Said another way, our efforts in renewables will mirror the strength of our integrated platform. And when augmented by our partnership with NRG Yield, our renewables business, which is net cash positive on a full year basis, does not require permanent capital from NRG.","In addition, the reintegration of NRG Renew will not cause any change to our financial guidance. I am also pleased to announce that NRG and NRG Yield have reallocated $50 million in previously committed cash equity from the residential solar partnership to the business renewable partnership. This change reinforces our alignment with NRG Yield with mutual focus in renewable energy development.","Finally, as you will know from the slide, we are in active negotiations around strategic transactions Home Solar and EVgo, so my comments will be limited. I do expect to complete this process in the second quarter.","Turning on to slide 12, I want to walk you through our revised approach to NRG dividend. The dividend was launched in 2012 for several reasons, to better highlight the value of our contracted assets; to enable ownership by dividend restricted income funds; and to add yield support. Today, our world looks much different than it in 2012. We now have a deliberate dividend paying vehicle in NRG Yield to highlight the value of contracted generation and the assumed volatility in the IPP sector has mitigated our ability to realize yield support. And so, we meet our fundamental view that a static dividend approach is not an appropriate use of capital, given the deep cyclical nature of our sector. With that, we are reducing the dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.58 per share or to about 1% yield. I want to be crystal clear that this reduction is not due to balance sheet constrains. It is simply aligning our dividend approach with our broader focus on adaptability, while at the same time, maintaining a differentiated platform that appeals to a broad range of investors and creating shareholder value through all commodity, credit and development cycles.","Moving to slide 13, this is one of the most important topics of today\u2019s call. My core fundamental view on capital allocation is to stay focus on what we want to become. However, given the deep cyclical nature of the sector, we must first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We are proactively taking the necessary steps to not only there\u2019s no doubt about our strength during this cycle but also to take advantage of opportunities that arise during market dislocations. Kirk will discuss in more detail the specifics, but I want to offer three takeaways.","One, the nearing conclusion of our large capital reinvestment program provides us the latitude to effectively harvest strong free cash flows through our asset optimization program, as I believe we have a good line of sight on market prices and environmental requirements, at least through the end of the decade. Next, paying down debt is fundamental as it assures our equity holders that NRG has the flexibility to create strong returns for them when the market recovers, and it assures our customers a stronger counterparty. My goal is to create no doubt in the strength of our balance sheet. So, at this time, maintaining our current target ratio of four and a quarter corporate debt to corporate EBITDA gives us ample headroom to our bound covenants and it is consistent with our credit ratings. Last, I remain committed to returning cash to shareholders when we feel that our capital structure is strong enough to allow for flexibility in the event of our prolonged commodity and capital market downturn.","I ask that you don\u2019t take our focus on the deleveraging in 2016 as an indication that NRG has turned away from returning capital to shareholders. Rather, I think of it as assuring that our shareholders can have confidence that NRG will be in a strong position to benefit from opportunities and better market conditions.","I will now turn it over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirk Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio and good morning everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on slide 15, NRG delivered a total of $3.34 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.127 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2015. Our 2015 results highlight the benefits and resilience of our integrated platform as the low commodity price environment helped Home Retail deliver $739 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding our original 2015 guidance of that segment by more than 20%. Business and Renew achieved $1.881 billion in EBITDA for the year, while NRG Yield which was aided by robust wind conditions in California late in the fourth quarter, contributed $720 million.","NRG completed $786 million in dropdowns to NRG Yield in 2015, helping expand capital available for allocation and allowing us to return over $1.3 billion to stakeholders. $628 million of this capital was returned to shareholders including the repurchase of approximately 7% shares outstanding. Having shifted our capital allocation focus late in 2015, since November and through this past month, NRG has retired approximately $700 million in unsecured debt, including over $400 million at the NRG level and $274 million at GenOn. Our reduced unsecured debt allowances will also help increase recurring cash flow with over $50 million in annualized interest savings realized so far, as a result of these efforts.","I\u2019d also like to briefly address one element of our 2015 results outside of EBITDA and free cash flow that is the non-cash impairment charges we took in the fourth quarter. On an annual basis, we test our long lived assets and goodwill for potential impairment. Given the prolonged low commodity price outlook, we adjusted our long-term view of power prices, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $5.1 billion, consisting of a write-down of certain fixed assets as well as goodwill. Due to the lack of robust forward prices in ERCOT, this change -- charge rather, is primarily related to impairments of our two coal plants in that market as well as goodwill related to the 2006 acquisition of Texas Genco, of which these two coal plants were a part.","Based on the robust commodity price outlook at the time of the acquisition, we allocated the substantial portion of the Texas Genco purchase price to the coal plants with minimal value allocated to the gas plants. And although since that time the Texas Genco portfolio has delivered over $8.5 billion of unlevered free cash flow and provided the platform for our expansion into retail with the acquisition of Reliant in 2009, the outlook in the ERCOT market is nonetheless shifted substantially, currently favoring gas over coal. The impairment of our two ERCOT coal plants aligns the book value of these assets with their forward cash flow profile, as implied by the current market environment. And while the shift in market dynamics also implies the value of our gas portfolio in Texas now substantially exceeds its book value, as many of you are aware accounting rules permit only the write-down of asset book values and do not permit a write-up.","These impairment charges also resulted in cumulative net income for the prior three-year period falling below the threshold prescribed for evaluation allowance against our net deferred tax asset balance, largely associated with NRG\u2019s tax NOLs. As a result, our one-time fourth quarter charges also include a $3 billion non-cash charge to tax expense, resulting from a contra asset entry on NRG\u2019s balance sheet, as required under GAAP as a valuation allowance offsetting our net deferred tax asset balance. That said, this accounting charge has no bearing on our ability to utilize our NOLs against future taxable income, and we continue to fully expect to do so.","Finally, turning to our 2016 guidance, we are reaffirming the previously announced guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth, which as Mauricio indicated earlier, reflect our expectations for consolidated 2016 results including business renewables, which was previously part of GreenCo. A point of clarification, business renewables NRG\u2019s commercial and industrial distributed solar business, our utility scale renewable assets were not part of the GreenCo business previously excluded from our guidance.","Turning to slide 16, I\u2019d like to briefly summarize our capital allocation progress in 2015, focusing on the NRG level, which excludes cash and capital projects at various excluded subsidiaries, primarily GenOn and NRG Yield. Total NRG level capital available through 2015 was $1.7 billion that is shown on the left of the slide. Capital available to NRG includes three components: First NRG level excess cash at the end of 2014, which is basically cash and cash equivalents, less our $700 million minimum cash liquidity reserve, net of any cash collateral posted as of the year-end; second, the portion of our consolidated free cash flow before growth at the NRG level, which is in 2015 was just over $800 million; and finally, during 2015, as I mentioned earlier, NRG receives $786 million proceeds from NRG Yield, which comprises the third component of capital available. During 2015, NRG level capital allocated totaled approximately $1.2 billion with more than half of that amount returned to our shareholders.","Having shifted our focus late in the year toward debt reduction, we ended 2015 by retiring $246 million of principal across various maturities of NRG\u2019s unsecured notes, which significantly expanded the reduction of corporate debt beyond the amortization of our term loan facility. And as I mentioned earlier, we continued that deleveraging process through the first two months of the year, which I\u2019ll address more comprehensively when we turn to 2016 capital allocation in a moment. The remaining $312 million was allocated toward growth investments. Importantly, this amount represents a reduction of over $450 million versus our original growth investments forecast provided on our first quarter 2015 earnings call. At that point, we projected approximately $960 million in consolidated growth investments with nearly $800 million of that amount expected at the NRG level. This reduction in NRG level spend was the result of both the slower pace of Home Solar as well as the elimination of other growth investments.","Turning to our 2016 NRG level capital allocation plans on slide 17 and building on the delevering process -- progress, rather, we\u2019ve made since November 2015. I will see -- 2016 will see a more significant shift towards further debt reduction, leaving no doubt that our balance sheet strength and credit ratios will remain resilient even if the current low commodity prices continue beyond the current year.","We expect approximately $1.5 billion of capital available for allocation at the NRG level in 2016, which again represents excess capital beyond our minimum cash balance reserve for liquidity, which is further supplemented by our $2.5 billion credit facility. 2016 capital available for allocation consists of the excess cash balance at the NRG level at year-end 2015 plus the mid-point of our NRG level free cash flow before gross guidance and expected proceeds from dropdown to NRG Yield of approximately $125 million in 2016. These expected dropdown proceeds consistent of the substantial portion of what remains under our residential solar and business renewable or DG partnerships at NRG Yield, and represents the return of the portion of our 2016 growth investments toward these two businesses.","This month, in order to align the size of these two partnerships with NRG\u2019s strategic priorities, we have reached an agreement with NRG Yield to shift the amount of capital between Home Solar and the business renewables partnership. As a result, the Home Solar partnership was reduced by $50 million to $100 million with a corresponding $50 million increase to the business renewables partnership, reflecting the more robust and reliable pipeline of business renewables which has now been reintegrated within NRG.","We expect to allocate approximately 75% of our 2016 NRG level capital or over $1 billion towards further debt reduction in 2016. This consists of ongoing term loan amortization as well as over $150 million in NRG corporate debt already retired, year-to-date. We plan to supplement this deleveraging in two ways. First, we will allocate $600 million of capital towards NRG debt retirement through open market purchases or tenders. And second, being mindful of our next NRG bond maturity in 2018, which is now approximately $1 billion in principal outstanding and the backdrop of the current dislocation in high yield market, we will reserve an additional $325 million toward the retirement of our 2018 notes in connection with the coincident refinancing of the balance when market conditions are more favorable. While our current priority is to ensure an efficient retirement and refinancing of our 2018 notes, as conditions evolve, we will continue to evaluate the best use of this debt reduction capital and may choose to allocate it toward different maturities, should this alternative prove more favorable. In any event, we expect this capital to ultimately be allocated toward corporate debt reduction, in order to meaningfully advance our efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet and ensure adherence to our target balance sheet metrics, even through an extended low cycle and commodity prices.","As Mauricio indicated earlier, we have now adjusted our dividend rate to a level consistent with both our capital allocation priorities and a cyclical and capital intensive nature of our business. And while the current depressed level of our share price undoubtedly represents the compelling return opportunity, we believe it is prudent to continue our progress in right-sizing corporate debt and strengthening ratios, which will enable us the flexibility to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities for shareholders. Such opportunities are only made truly compelling by first ensuring the strength of the balance sheet, which supports this.","For 2016, we expect just over $300 million of growth investments, consisting primarily of our P.H. Robinson peaker project, Carbon 360 and our commitment pursuant to the California EVgo settlement. During 2016, we are also focused on executing on opportunities to further expand capital available for allocation, including $250 million of non-recourse financing included as part of our reset announcement last year. As I indicated on our third quarter call, we are now fully prepared to launch this financing when market conditions are more favorable.","In addition, we continue to expect the next utility-scale dropdown offer to NRG Yield to be our remaining stake in CVSR and plan to offer this yield in 2016. We are currently exploring this yield the best mean to efficiently finance this dropdown towards this yield and prudently managing its liquidity while continuing to replenish capital to NRG. I expect we\u2019ll have more to share with you on the timing and the payment structure later this year.","And finally, tuning to slide 18, in light of our significantly deleveraging progress and having provided an extended look at our 2016 capital allocation plan, I would like to update the information we provided last quarter regarding NRG capital structure and 2016 corporate credit metrics. Focusing on recourse debt at the NRG level, which prior to deleveraging, we had expected to be approximately $8.8 billion as of year-end 2016, on our third quarter call, we indicated our intention to reduce that debt by at least $500 million. Having completed half of this objective during the fourth quarter alone, we ended 2015 with just over $8.5 billion in recourse debt.","Since then and through February, we completed an additional $171 million in debt reduction, as shown on the far right column of the slide. And as a result, based on the midpoint of our guidance and our implied 2016 corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio is already nearly in line with our four and a quarter target. However, our goal is to maintain adherence to that target in 2017 and beyond, taking into account the possibility of sustained low commodity prices. This objective drives our continued focus on further debt reduction over the course of 2016. As I indicated previously in reviewing 2016 capital allocation, we expect to further reduce corporate debt by at least another $600 million this year. Taking that additional deleveraging into account, we are on track to drive corporate debt below $8 billion by the end of the year, which would place our corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio at approximately four times.","And finally, factoring on and the effective releasing the $325 million of additional capital, we have currently reserved for further reducing our 2018 maturity. That 2016 ratio would be reduced to 3.8 times. One way to consider that number is that it allows us to maintain adherence to our four and a quarter target ratio, even if corporate EBITDA were to be reduced by approximately $200 million, as a result of sustained low commodity prices.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Kirk. And we have taken a lot of time this morning. So, let me just end with our priorities for 2016 on slide 20. We have the right portfolio and the right platform to succeed in this environment. And with the further strengthening of our balance sheet, we will be in a great position to seize opportunities during this challenging market and greatly benefit to when it turns around. I look forward to the next phase of NRG. Thank you.","And operator, let\u2019s open the lines now for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. You may begin.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning, guys, a few questions. I\u2019ll start with the detailed one. So, I just want to be clear on page 10, when you talk about the $150 million of EBITDA by year-end \u201817. Should we assume that that\u2019s an aspiration to improve your run rate EBITDA by that amount?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Correct.","Greg Gordon","Or is that just accumulative impact on EBITDA of 150?","Mauricio Gutierrez","No. Good morning, Greg. And no, the objective here is to make it a recurring $150 million cost reduction that will impact EBITDA directly.","Greg Gordon","Great, thanks. And on page 17, when you talk about the CVSR and non-recourse fainting below the lines; if those are not included in your available capital, so should you be successful in achieving those that would be accretive?","Kirk Andrews","That\u2019s correct. Those would be incremental to capital available for allocation, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And that would be my big picture question, Mauricio. So sort of the first thing that happened after you took over the CEO role was we saw that in terms of a capital allocation decision as we saw that you cleared a new power plant in the New England auction, which was a little bit disconcerting to investors who are looking for a capital allocation program that was more focused on shrinking the balance sheet. Obviously that\u2019s the core message that you\u2019re giving us today. So, can you characterize, if you were to disbursement [ph] free up this incremental dropdown money on non-recourse financing, how do you think about each incremental dollar for capital allocation going forward and how do you characterize what you\u2019re doing in New England in the context of the message you are giving us today?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Greg. And I understand that that was the first news. And the timing with the New England capacity auction is something that I don\u2019t control. Let me just start by providing you kind of the general -- my general take on capital allocation and then I\u2019ll go into the specifics of Canal. As you can see from all the actions that we\u2019re taking today, one of my key priorities, the first 90 days of being the CEO, was to focus on capital allocation, first being mindful and aware of the current commodity cycle that we are today and then second the dislocation that we have in our capital markets. It was important to me to afford us the maximum flexibility when deploying capital and to exert absolute financial discipline. I already talked about the actions that we\u2019re taking, one on deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet, and ensuring that we go through this cycle with the strong position to capitalize on opportunities, but importantly that we\u2019re ready when the market turns around; two, the recalibration of the dividend; and then three, is the focus on cost savings and streamlining the cost structure on the organization.","So, when I think about to Canal, it is not a capital allocation decision for 2016, it\u2019s a capital allocation decision that we will make in 2018 and at that point, we will evaluate the current environment. And on that perspective then, we\u2019ll make the determination what is the best use of our capital. But I want to make sure that we continue to generating low cost options at good returns, given the opportunity that we have to lock for seven years a very constructive capacity prices. And as I told you in the prepared remarks, in our focus in the Northeast and particularly in New England is focus on capacity revenues. And now is a dual fuel peaker that is needed in that market at good returns and it\u2019s a capital allocation decision that we will make not today, where we are focusing all our attention on strengthening the balance sheet but in two years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. You may begin.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning. Congratulations Mauricio and Kevin.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Julien. Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, perhaps first the follow-up on Greg\u2019s last question on capital allocation. Can you elaborate on your latest thinking on the wholesale portfolio itself? Obviously it\u2019s been under a good bit of strain, [ph] how do you think about reinvesting in your exiting asset portfolio and timing for rationalization, as you continue to see current -- before it manifest itself?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, Julien. So first of all, I -- we are actually in the last year of what I consider a high water mark with respect to reinvesting in our portfolio. After acquiring GenOn and EME, we increased our portfolio significantly to close to 50,000 megawatts. We went through a process where we optimized that portfolio through fuel conversions and environmental retrofit. So, as you know, we have been executing that plan and this year is the last year of that. What I expect in the next couple of years is really to harvest on that investment. All the market dynamics that we were expecting when we made those investments are playing out, particularly around reliability and capacity for all three Northeast markets, whether it\u2019s PJM for capacity performance New England and New York. We are moving forward that; we saw that during the polar vortex, we acted upon. And it\u2019s playing out the way we thought it was going to play out.","Now, with respect to other parts of the country, you know that I will expect absolute financial discipline when it comes to the profitability of our assets. If it\u2019s not economically viable, we will shut them down, just like we have done in the past and just like we are doing today, in New York. If the market conditions don\u2019t support our generation portfolio, we will take action on it. But we need to also take into consideration, not only the current state of the commodity cycle but also the prospective opportunities that we see.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then coming back to what you were just talking about, the expansion was done on the EME. How do you think auction that\u2019s on here? I mean, obviously it\u2019s a dynamic situation but you paid down some debt there and cash on hand. What you think about next step and the timing of that?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Right. Look, I mean Julien, most of the -- bulk of the GenOn portfolios and PJM, we value significantly our strategic in the Northeast in particular in the PJM area. But what I\u2019ll tell you is in the spirit of streamlining our organization that applies to streamlining our capital structure, I would like to see that. But, we will only do it if it is add value and not having a negative impact on our credit profile. And that\u2019s the option that we are going to continue to maintain going forward.","Kirk, do you have any additional comments?","Kirk Andrews","Sure. I mean first of all, I agree with that obviously, we have taken an important step obviously towards deleveraging, as you acknowledged, Julien. But as I have indicated in my past remarks, at various conferences and one-on-ones, that order of magnitude is certainly helpful and necessary but sufficient in order to bring about rightsizing that balance sheet. I\u2019ll remind folks, certainly we have got some near-term maturity with GenOn, we are focused on that as part and parcel of why we went at the delevering that we did. And as you saw in GenOn -- in Mauricio\u2019s remarks, rather we have continuation of our asset sale program, which as we have indicated previously going back to the reset as focused on the Northeast. So, we\u2019d expect it\u2019s likely, more likely that that would probably come out of the GenOn complex which would enhance liquidity.","But as the year progresses, certainly I would believe 2016 as the key inflection point, given those loan maturities. And we are mindful of the options obviously, continuing to delever through the open market purchase, as we have done before. We are recognizing -- we recognize that we have got some secured debt capacity there that provides us some alternative as well. So, what I would tell you is that as the year unfolds, I would expect you to hear more from us in terms of what we plan on executing there. And we are hopeful in terms of addressing and rightsizing the capital structure but -- and by reiterating what Mauricio said, we are only going to do that being mindful of preserving the integrity of the NRG balance sheet and the process.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Jonathan Arnold","One quick one, Mauricio, I think when you talked about the dividend, you talked about a static dividend being inappropriate in the context of the reduction. But, could you just clarify what we should be expecting going forward from this lower level, is it just to stay here as a token to allow yield investors to own the stock, or do you look to grow it modestly over time?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. No, Jonathan, I mean first of all, the actions that we are taking on the dividend are -- I guess there are two main reasons. One, I think this level is consistent with the nature of power industry, capital intensive and cyclical. But certainly, when I look at the current dividend that we have and the underlying premises or principles that we used to implement it in 2012, a lot of them are not valid anymore. If you recall, when we announced the dividend back then, it was to highlight the value of contracted assets. Since then, we created NRG Yield; we already talk about -- one of the objectives was the yield support. And in this current market environment and with the level of volatility that we\u2019re seeing in the stocks, it really doesn\u2019t accomplish that objective.","So, when I put the two together, one the nature of our industry and two, some of the principles that we had when we initiated, it\u2019s just inconsistent. I think what you should expect is this number is the right number today and it afford us the maximum flexibility for capital deployment and capital allocation. And that is my assessment right now on the dividend.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, makes sense. And just another topic, you\u2019ve obviously been streamlining management structures out of the cost reductions et cetera. Can you just maybe give us a little more insight into what some of the key changes have been; where you are in that process; are they largely behind now, just some of the operational changes that may have gone on?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Look, I mean, I think with respect to the streamlining the organization, we started the end of last year. We went through significant efforts to reduce the cost structure. And over the past three months, I have continued with that effort on rationalizing and focusing the organization into our core strengths and as I articulated already in my remarks, focusing on what I think is the core value of energy, which is putting together generation and retail and the plus points around it. So, I am very comfortable today with the management team that I have. This is an area that I am going to continue evaluating in the weeks to come. And I think you should expect from me additional announcements, as I go to even further in line of our businesses, particularly as we go through the outcome of the GreenCo process.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Two questions, one capital structure related. Just curious, you\u2019ve announced a lot of debt reduction at the NRG level for 2016. Curious what your thoughts are about the debt reduction targets at the GenOn level in 2016. The only reason I ask that is you highlight the NRG debt maturity coming in 2018, but obviously GenOn has some too, and that some of the growth for NRG, meaning the Canal expansion that just cleared or even the Mandalay repowering that has a contract, those are actually assets owned within the GenOn box. So just curious about kind of the balance between debt reduction at GenOn and some of those growth projects of assets that are at the GenOn box that are actually part of NRG, Inc.\u2019 growth trajectory?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Michael. And let me just handle it to Kirk to answer the first part of the GenOn question, and I\u2019ll take the next.","Kirk Andrews","Sure. Thanks Mauricio. Michael, first of all on the Cana, which as I said in addressing Julien\u2019s question, we\u2019ve obviously begun to make progress in terms of delevering that\u2019s been our confidence in doing that, we\u2019re mindful of balancing, maintaining adequate liquidity at GenOn with the need to obviously attack the capital structure at the same time, which is why the asset sale process obviously kick started that. We got a head start on it at the end of the year having announced a couple of asset sales and we\u2019re moving forward obviously to close the second of those two and continuing to focus on completing the remaining 500 or the remainder of the 500 that we announced on the reset, which as I indicated Julien, given the fact that we\u2019re very clear about the fact that we expect those still be in the Northeast, the expectation, the knock-on expectation certainly is that that would continue to be at the GenOn level.","So, we use the proceeds of those asset sales to continue to deploy towards deleveraging. And as we move through year, we\u2019re mindful of that 2017 maturity, which is why supplemented by those asset sales, as I indicated also to Julien\u2019s question, we\u2019re focused on the best means apprehensively to use the options that are disposable, not only asset sales, but obviously we\u2019ve got some secured debt capacity there that we\u2019re remindful of. So, all I can tell you as we progress through the year, we\u2019re going to focus on those alternatives and the best means possible, as I said though, always being mindful of preserving the integrity of the balance sheet of NRG given the non-recourse nature of the GenOn subsidiary, which will continue to be the case.","Michael Lapides","Got it.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Michael, with respect to your second part of the question, what I will say is that we\u2019re going to continue developing options to grow the portfolio. When we have long-term contracts, we\u2019re going to do it in close partnership with NRG Yield to continue replenishing capital; when it doesn\u2019t have the profile to be able to be dropdown, that\u2019s not a capital decision -- capital allocation decision that we need to make today. And we\u2019re going to evaluate it when we have to actually deploy that capital. But I think it is important to continue to generate these projects in the context of growing our portfolio at good economics.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And one follow on Texas related, just curious our view is that coal plants in Texas are struggling to have cash break even right now. And even more importantly nuclear plants are generating limited cash flow, maybe positive but limited. At what point do you start considering coal retirement at ERCOT?","Mauricio Gutierrez","That\u2019s a great question, Michael. And so, let me give you my perspective on it. The current market in Taxes has been very disappointed, despite what I consider is still pretty strong fundamentals, strong demand and a pricing that doesn\u2019t incentivize new build economics, even though we have seen something, what I can say that out of not economical engine. When I look at our portfolio, particularly Parish and Limestone for and STP, they are very large in scale; they are environmentally controlled; and I would say that they are probably one of the most cost advantage based load plants or coal and nuclear plants in the state. We have identified what we believe is the least competitive assets in the supply stack when it comes to coal. And we believe that if the market continues to be at these levels, it will not be possible to sustain the operation of some of these assets. So that\u2019s why I think there is going to be a supply rationalization in the immediate term and we should see a recalibration of the market. I feel comfortable right now with the three of our base load plants. But I think we have a pretty good track record in terms of if and when these plants are not economic and the prospects of these plants are not positive, we will act upon. And we have done that in other regions and there is no reason why we\u2019d do it in Texas. But right now still not the time and I think the supply stack will react before we get to that point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may begin.","Steve Fleishman","The $513 million of available capital at year-end that you are using in 2016, is that above kind of your normal cash levels? And if so, what cash do you have kind of available beyond that?","Mauricio Gutierrez","It is -- Steve -- and I\u2019ll let Kirk give you specific details, but this is above the cash reserve that we have for both NRG and GenOn.","Kirk Andrews","Sure. And this was -- good morning, Steve. This is one of the reasons why -- I think in a couple of points in my prepared remarks I made specific reference to contextualize capital available for allocation, which we consider to be a cash surplus versus cash on the balance sheet. And so, when we calculate that, we start with the minimum cash balance that we reserve at the NRG level. So, we set aside $700 million for liquidity. Now that -- part of that liquidity is what we need for cash collateral proceeds for example. So, as we post cash collateral, we consider that a utilization of the minimum cash reserve. So, whatever we deduct at any given time, think it about as $700 million in minimum cash minus the amount of cash collateral we posted. Comprehensively, and this is outside of capital available for allocation, we focus on liquidity separately. So, liquidity is that $700 million of minimum cash at the NRG level plus the $2.5 billion corporate credit facility. That\u2019s separate in a part from what we consider excess capital, which is with that $513 million that you refer to represents. Does that help?","Steve Fleishman","Yes, I think so. One other question, just on NRG Yield. Mauricio, as you thought about NRG yield, what is your view of kind of a long term strategy around it? And if it stays at a relatively depressed stock price, what are your options?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, Steve. Well, I mean I\u2019ll answer it from the NRG standpoint, and we are going to have the NRG Yield call in about 30 minutes. So, let me just say that the relationship between NRG and NRG Yield is there is a lot of synergies and it\u2019s a symbiotic relationship. It\u2019s of great importance for NRG. This is a way for us to access low cost of capital to replenish our capital, particularly on the development front in this type of commodity cycle. We need to have a good development platform for NRG Yield to have clear line of sight in terms of the growth and the potential dropdown that we have. That will benefit energy yield and a healthy NRG Yield is good for NRG in terms of our ability to stay competitive in developing new sites. So, that\u2019s kind of my take on it. And I want to be very careful that I give you the answer from kind of the NRG perspective. And we can go into more detail when we go through the NRG Yield call.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more caller. Our last question is from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering. You may begin.","Neel Mitra","Hi, good morning. I just had a follow-up question on the ERCOT coal power plant. Are there any opportunities to renegotiate the transport agreements or lower your PRB coal costs, so that those plants are more cost advantage at this point?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Neel. And I will discipline myself to pass the mic to Chris Moser, who is the Head of Commercial Operations. Although under my watch, COO, I renegotiated a number of rail contracts. They have been good partners in this downturn of -- this commodity cycle downturn. But Chris, what are your thoughts on that?","Chris Moser","No, I think that\u2019s fair. I think we continue to work with our coal supply partners, both the mines -- the coal miners and the railroad company as well to make sure that we add to the plants competitiveness, to the extent that we can. They, as Mauricio just alluded to, have been good partners with us so far and we continue to look forward to working them with them in the future.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you. And I recognize that you may have a lot more questions. We will get to them, and Kevin and the IR team will be available for any follow-ups. But unfortunately, we have a hard stop; we have to get NRG Yield call ongoing. So, thank you. And I look forward to continue this conversation. Thank you, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day."],"16607":["NRG Energy, Inc.

Securities, Inc.","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NRG Energy Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Takia. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's second quarter 2017 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes, and being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts.","As this is an earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation as well as risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law.","In addition, we'll refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and presentation.","Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business.","Just a few weeks ago, we announced our comprehensive and multi-dimensional transformation plan. Since then, we've had the opportunity to speak with many of you in great detail about our plan, which will better position us as the leader in the competitive power space.","We are actively engaged on all fronts, and I look forward to updating you on our hard work and progress in the next quarter. But for this call, we will keep our remarks brief and focus on our quarterly results. Also, you will know that all the financial and operational results discussed today do not include GenOn due to its bankruptcy filing.","Starting on slide 4 with the summary and highlights for the quarter. Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $685 million, in line with our second quarter results from last year and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. We are also reaffirming our full-year financial guidance for 2017 for both EBITDA and free cash flow.","Our integrated platform performed quite well during the quarter. Both Generation and Retail financial results were slightly lower given the mild weather experienced in the quarter and lower hedged prices. This was offset by strong results from Renewables, NRG Yield and the change in our Home Solar business model announced early in the year.","We also remain focused on execution and made significant progress on our key priorities. First, we continue to execute on our capital recycling program with NRG Yield. We completed one dropdown and made two separate offers that will further strengthen that partnership. We believe these transactions highlight the renewable platform stability to enhance Yield's growth going forward, with opportunities both inside and outside of the current ROFO Agreement.","Second, we announced our transformation plan, which laid out a much clear path of value for investors and will significantly strengthen and simplify our business, so that it will provide in many market cycles.","And finally, we made substantial progress towards resolving GenOn. We continued to work diligently with GenOn and its stakeholders through the bankruptcy process and can report that GenOn currently remains on track to emerge from bankruptcy by the year-end.","As you can see, it has been a busy several months, and I am extremely proud of all the hard work and focus that have gone into making this a strong quarter for our business.","Turning to our key operational metrics on slide 5. I am very pleased with our safety performance for the quarter. We are just shy of top decile performance with 108 out of 129 facilities operating without a single recordable injury. We actually have fewer injuries year-over-year. And while these numbers are good, we will never be satisfied. The safety of our people is our number one priority, and we will continue to focus our resources on improving our safety record over the balance of the year and beyond.","Performance was strong for our generation fleet. Total megawatts produced were 6% higher compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven largely by the return to service of our South Central Cottonwood combined-cycle plant following a significant flooding event in the first quarter of 2016, as well as higher coal generation.","The availability of our generation fleet also increased during the quarter as we had fewer repowering and environmental compliance outages. More importantly, our fleet was available almost 94% of the time as you can see by our In the Money Availability metric.","Our Retail business delivered a steady quarter driven by strong customer acquisition and retention, as well as reductions in operating costs. Both sales and customer account increased helping to offset milder than normal weather.","Now moving to our key market on slide 6. Starting on the left side of the page with the ERCOT market. The fundamentals in this market are strong, and we continued to see trends that point to market tightening over the next several years. Weather-normalized demand growth in ERCOT has averaged 2.3% over the last 12 months, which is well above the flat to negative growth of every other competitive market in the country. This steady demand has been driven by strong increases in population and employment as well as new coastal demand from the industrial sector.","On the supply side, we continue to see delays in new builds with actual megawatts brought online coming in well below expectations. Since the latest CDR report for May, we have seen 1-gigawatt of new generation being delayed from 2018 to later years and a new 700-megawatt combined-cycle removed from the CDR. At the same time, we're seeing continued pressure for retirements given the low prices experienced in Texas over the past several years.","These market dynamics have become evident in the reserve margin calculation that indicates the tightness of market supply versus peak demand. As you can see in the chart, just in the last 18 months, reserve margins for 2018 went from the mid 20s to the high-teens. And it does not take too much in terms of additional retirements, load growth or delays to get to single-digit numbers. For these reasons, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in our opinion.","However, there are changes that need to be made to strengthen the market, including marginal losses, improved locational scarcity pricing and enhanced performance of the ORDC. We will continue our work with ERCOT, the PUCT and other stakeholders to improve price formation and ensure the well functioning of ERCOT's energy-only market.","Turning to the right side of our slide, I want to highlight the premium location of our generation fleet. In Texas, we have seen price separation between Houston and other areas. This is driven primarily by strong load growth in the area and transmission congestion. The Houston load pocket is where most of our generation is located, and given the drivers I mentioned, we would expect this premium to continue in the future.","Turning to PJM. During the quarter, we had the 2021 BRA Capacity Auction, which was the first with 100% capacity performance requirement. As you can see on the chart, over 85% of our capacity in PJM clear in the ComEd premium zone at almost $190 per megawatt day.","These are two clear examples of our plans having a competitive advantage, given their location near load pockets benefiting from premium prices.","Before handing things over to Kirk on the topic of markets, I want to take a moment to reiterate NRG's strong support and advocacy of competitive markets for both retail and wholesale.","We are disappointed with the rulings in New York and Illinois regarding subsidies for nuclear generation. However, there are strong grounds for appeal in these cases. We will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets and expect (09:50) both the courts and the new FERC commissioners to take a fresh look at this issue. We remain optimistic that these subsidies will be found to be damaging to both the market and to consumers as these cases progress to the core system.","I will now turn to Kirk for our financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on slide 8. For the second quarter, NRG delivered $685 million in adjusted EBITDA and $240 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. Total adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was relatively in line with the second quarter of 2016 and Generation and Renewables contributed $212 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield delivered $203 million and $270 million, respectively.","As a reminder and as I reviewed during our transformation plan presentation a couple of weeks ago, our consolidated financial results as well as our guidance now reflect a deconsolidation of GenOn.","Turning to guidance for 2017, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance ranges which are provided and updated as a part of our transformation plan rollout to reflect adjustments related to the deconsolidation of GenOn as well as the impact of $65 million in 2017 cost savings and $175 million in one-time working capital improvements from the plan.","For your reference, I've included in the appendix the slide from our transformation plan presentation, which details these two adjustments to 2017 guidance. As a reminder, however, as I also indicated on the transformation plan call, our expectations for the balance of the year continue to place us at the lower end of the guidance range.","On August 1, we closed the sale to NRG Yield of our remaining 25% interest in the TE Wind portfolio consisting of 12 wind projects for a total cash consideration of $41 million. In addition, we have now offered yield a 38-megawatt portfolio of distributed and small utility-scale solar assets, which are not part of the ROFO Agreement. And we have proposed the creation of the new $50 million distributed generation partnership. These potential dropdowns are subject to negotiation with and the approval by NRG Yield's independent directors.","Finally, during the quarter, we successfully closed on a number of non-recourse project financings resulting in approximately $500 million in cash proceeds, including over $350 million of debt proceeds for the construction of our Carlsbad contract to cash plant in California. NRG has now repaid the $125 million outstanding balance under our corporate revolver leaving this facility now undrawn.","As a reminder, we had made that draw earlier in the year to fund the corresponding drawdown by GenOn under the intercompany revolver. Although that intercompany balance remains outstanding, GenOn is required to repay the balance upon emergence from bankruptcy. And in anticipation of that event, we repaid the NRG revolver this past quarter using excess cash on hand, which we expect will be replenished upon GenOn's emergence from bankruptcy and the corresponding repayment of the intercompany revolver.","Turning to slide 9 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation. Our updated capital available for allocation now reflects the proceeds received from the closing of the TE Wind dropdown further increasing expected surplus capital at year-end to $170 million. As we reviewed with you on July 12, we expect to significantly build on this balance during the first half of 2018 using proceeds from asset sales which assuming a sale of 100% of NRG Yield and Renewables would help drive anticipated excess cash to just over $4 billion by the end of 2018.","To complete the financial review, slide 10 provides an update on our corporate credit metrics. Having previously provided a pro forma view of these ratios based on the full impact of the transformation plan, this page focuses on our expected credit ratio for 2017 with the denominator of that ratio based on the midpoint of our guidance for the year.","Our expected year-end gross debt balance of $7.2 billion continues to reflect the expected deployment of $600 million in 2017 capital previously allocated toward debt reduction, which we expect to execute later this year.","Our corporate credit ratios are largely unchanged since our first quarter update and we continue to expect to achieve a net corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.7 times. As we reviewed as a part of the transformation plan, we expect to be able to achieve our target 3 times ratio by 2018 based on the EBITDA benefits of the cost savings and margin improvements.","Additional deleveraging in 2018 will be necessary solely as a result of the reduction in EBITDA associated with assets targeted for sale. We intend to fund this additional debt reduction with the proceeds from asset sales, and based on a 100% sale of NRG Yield and Renewables, would expect incremental debt reduction to be approximately $650 million in order to maintain our target ratio.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kirk. And to close, I want to leave you with our priorities for the balance of the year on slide 13 (sic) [slide 12].","We have remained focused on delivering our operational and financial goals while continuing to strengthen and simplify our business. Our priorities to enhance margins and streamline costs optimize our portfolio and right-size our capital structure are now integrated into our transformation plan. And we will begin updating the market on our progress starting on our third quarter call.","Also, we would expect to update the market with any material announcements regarding asset sales as they occur. As we work through these sales processes and improvements, we will also provide you a more definitive timeline for our Investor Day.","I thank you for your time today and your interest in NRG. And with that, operator, we're now ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I mean, I think the quarter speaks for itself pretty good numbers. And, I guess, the only thing that's material that seems to have changed is the inclusion of the $41 million from the dropdown in the cash available for distribution. So, let me ask you a different question. I know that when you announced the transformation plan, you had indicated that some of the sales processes had already been sort of well underway while others like the process of looking for a strategic alternative for NRG Yield had been more nascent because it had only begun formally after the board approved the full transformation plan.","So, can you just give us some sense of what you think the cadence of announcements will be on disposition of assets, and what we might expect to happen in the nearer term, and what we might need to sort of be cognizant of waiting for towards the end of the year?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Greg, so, as you already pointed it out, I mean, we begun some of these processes earlier in the year. They are in very advanced stages. We tried to staggered some of these sales initiatives to make sure that we access the market in an efficient way. My expectation is that the first announcements will come out in late third quarter, early fourth quarter. I don't think you should expect every single one of the announcements to be in the fourth quarter or late fourth quarter. As soon as we know, you will know. And I think that as early as the end of the third quarter, we will be in a position to update you in the processes that we started earlier in the year.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And then on the third quarter call, we'll get a sense of how far along you are in the preliminary rounds of cost optimization as well.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Absolutely. I mean, as you know, we started the sales process earlier. So, I think we're going to begin doing that sometime in the end of the third quarter. But the cost savings and the working capital and everything else is really starting in earnest now. And I will be in a position to update you and the rest of the market in our third quarter call.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you, guys. Have a good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. You've given a ton of detail over the last month. Thank you for this, in terms of your long-term planning. And by the way, super helpful. Mauricio, you made some comments about the court cases in New York and Illinois regarding nuclear subsidies. Can you talk about two things? One, what gives you what seems like such confidence on the appellate process for those cases? And two, when you look at your own nuclear plant in Texas, how do you think about whether this is a plant that's profitable at all or not, and when that's creating cash flow versus maybe just creating earnings?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Michael. So, obviously, we're disappointed with the rulings by the District Court both in Illinois and New York. I think that you should expect that we will appeal both to the Circuit Courts. I recognize that there are some improvements that we need to make to the market, both in terms of recognizing the attributes that each power plant brings to the system and to recognize also the impact of new technologies. But where we disagree is to have an out-of-market subsidy for one specific company in a technology that is now proven and mature that, in our view, at the expense of consumers and the integrity of competitive markets. I mean, that's really the concern.","So, we think that we have a strong case and with new FERC commissioners coming in, I think there will be a fresh look, a fresh perspective on the validity of our case and the potential impact that these out-of-market subsidies can have in the competitive markets. And we feel confident that this will prevail. Obviously, I can't comment anymore because this is an ongoing legal proceeding.","I mean, in terms of our nuclear plant South Texas Project in Texas, and that's true for any other plant in our Generation portfolio, we are constantly evaluating the financial health of our facilities, not only in the near-term, but in the long-term. What are the prospects, what is their profitability today and tomorrow? And I will tell you, because I think we have a pretty good track record for that. To the extent that facilities are non-operating, are not cash flow positive, we've taken steps to either improve their competitiveness or to retire them if we don't see any better prospects to that.","So, I think we will, in the case of STP in particular, I mean this is something that we obviously work closely with our partners. This is not just an NRG decision only. We have other two partners and we are all focused in improving the competitiveness of our nuclear plant.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abe Azar of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations on a great quarter.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Abe. Good morning.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","How did you determine to remove 3-gigawatts from your 2018 reserve margin forecast for Texas? Any of these announced yet? Are you expecting these retirements before the summer or after the summer?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. This is Chris. As we're looking at it, I think one thing is very clear about the CDR and that's that it overstates the amount of new generation that's coming and understates the amount of retirements. Now, I know that Vistra has talked about Monticello and Big Brown and Martin's Lake is being challenged, and that's 5-gigs, 5.5-gigs or so. So, we haircutted that to only 3-gigs and threw it in there as an example of what we would expect to happen sometime soon. But during this summer, no. I think it's sometime post summer.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. And just to complement what Chris said, I mean, what we tried to put here was the 2018 reserve margin. So, obviously, it's post summer of 2017. So, this is a 2018 look. And we want to make sure that people understand the levers or the drivers of the reserve margin, which translate in more or less scarcity prices. So, this will give you an assessment in terms of what we're seeing in the market in terms of delays of new builds and potential retirements that can happen in the near to medium term.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Shifting gears, how much of the cost savings are expected at Retail? And can you provide examples of how you'll achieve these savings while simultaneously growing margins?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. So, when you talk about \u2013 for Retail, we have done two things. One, there is a component that is embedded in the cost savings, in the $590 million of cost savings. And then there is a second component in terms of margin enhancement of $215 million. So, I think, when you're looking at both, I think you should look at them separately, Abe.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey. My questions were actually answered. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey. Thank you, Shahriar.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Mauricio, on the asset sales process, can we just clarify, are you sort of disciplining yourself to say, okay, we want deal to at least be announced in the fourth quarter by the end of this year, and if we can't get some assets across the finish line we're not going to sell them or could some of this move in to next year as well?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Ali, I mean, my expectation given where we are in the processes and the fact that we started earlier on some of them, in particular, in the conventional side my expectation is, it would have a clear line of sight by the end of the year. Obviously, we can't control the processes completely. It depends on our market response to it. But my expectation is that by the end of the year, we will have enough information to be able to provide you with our announcement on all the asset sales.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. But there's nothing to prevent \u2013 as you said, if some things are slipping into next year you're not going to stop that process.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","No. There is nothing to stop these processes. They are growing, they're growing very well. As I mentioned in the call a couple weeks ago, we've received very good response from the market so far. And I am encouraged by what I'm seeing. And I think that we'll be able to provide you something, as I mentioned earlier to Greg, as early as the third quarter call.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And on the conventional fuel side, the 6-gigawatts, are you seeing any influence from the fact that there seems to be significant amount of capacity whether it's portfolios or single assets on the market? It appears to be a buyer's market sitting from the outside. I don't know if you've seen that on the 6-gigawatt sale process.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","One thing that I think is important to recognize is that we characterize this 6-gigawatts, but these are not only assets but businesses. And these are profitable and good businesses, attractive businesses. So, they don't necessarily are competing with single asset sales completely. You should think about it as more of an integrated and comprehensive set of businesses and assets. We are seeing a lot of assets in the market, but I think what we have been able to put here is a type of asset or business that is differentiated from a single combined-cycle somewhere in the country.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Last question, Mauricio. Once the transformation is done, you're looking at an integrated platform with fossil fuel generation. Given your comments earlier, there seems to be a regulatory push towards subsidies of nuclear and renewables, ongoing subsidies of renewables. And apart from Texas, demand and load growth has been pretty flat to anemic. Does that concern you when you look at that portfolio with no renewables and this kind of market headwinds that you're going to be seeing once you're done with the transformation?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So, I think you need to look at it on a regional basis. So, in Texas, as you know, we have a very well balanced portfolio between Retail and Generation. I feel very comfortable with the amount of base load and peaking that we have to be able to manage our load obligations and our load business that we have in Texas. It continues to be a very attractive market, a very robust market as I mentioned on the call. We're not seeing any signs of a slowdown in terms of economic growth and load growth. So, I'm very comfortable in Texas.","In the Northeast, given the resolution of GenOn and some of the conventional asset sales that we're going to have, post the transformation plan, we will have an opportunity to rebalance that portfolio. And while we're going to be a little longer at generation, keep in mind that that generation is within the load pocket of the Chicago area, New York City or Southwest Connecticut and that these assets benefit significantly from capacity prices that have been very robust and continue to be robust as far as 2020, 2021. So, we have a five-year runway where it gives me a lot of comfort in terms of the rebalancing of our portfolio. And, obviously, we evaluate the composition of our integrated platform every time and we see if the asset mix that we have is the right mix to manage our load. So, that's how I think about the post-transformation plan in terms of our portfolio positioning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Ali.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Neel.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I had a question on the spread between ERCOT Houston and ERCOT North. I know it's been very healthy year-to-date, but how do you expect the Houston Import Project in 2018 to affect that spread going forward?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey, Neel. Chris here. I'll take that one. So, yeah. We've seen during work on the line some decent spreads in the real time in the day ahead especially the spring. Tapered off; now that we're in the summer, they've stopped working on it. Work will recommence here once we get into the fall. And then the question is, Houston Import Project obviously built to try and contain those spreads. Working against that might be some of these retirements in the north.","Obviously, supreme load growth down in the Gulf Coast. I saw in, I think it was Megawatt Daily yesterday that Oncor reported 3.9% quarter-on-quarter growth, which is obviously \u2013 I mean, that's double what the weather norm overall Texas piece was, which I think was 2.3% for the rolling 12 months. So, I mean, look, the growth is happening. It's happening in the Gulf Coast and that's where we are. That would tend to help buoy the spreads there in spite of even Houston Import.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. And it seems like the Limestone coal plant sits right at the beginning of the Houston Import Project. So, from a nodal perspective, do you expect Limestone to trade at a premium to ERCOT North or do you expect it to kind of just stay within the zone price?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, probably a slight premium. I wouldn't say it's huge and I don't think it would look just like the Houston price, but I would say slight premium.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And the second question, Mauricio. Just thinking about the $250 million Retail margin enhancement, what base should we think of when we model the $250 million? Just from the perspective of we have retail results now, you guys are bullish to Texas generation going forward. So, if post the results, really start to materialize in Texas, then Retail should naturally come down, which isn't a bad thing.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, Neel. So, well, first of all, it's $215 million just to make sure that we're correct in terms of margin enhancement. And what I said before is, obviously, when we did the comprehensive review of our business, we not only looked at cost savings but we also look at our businesses. And particularly in Retail, we knew that there is a, in terms of the scale and scope of our retail operations, there are very few people that we can actually compare ourselves to. So, we went a little outside of the power space and we went to the retail space, in the entire retail space in other industries to see what are the best practices.","And we identified two areas where we can actually improve our Retail business which we are very proud off, and I think everybody recognizes our leading position in this space. And that was building up our IT infrastructure and analytics. And I think everybody recognizes the amount of information that we have from our customers. And so, there is an opportunity here to really take our Retail business to the next level, adopting some of the best practices from other industries.","I think the midpoint that you were talking about, how should we think about it. For 2017, our midpoint was around $750 million give or take. So, the way I characterize this effort is, in the last three years, we grew our business roughly by $200 million. What we're saying that is in the next three years, we are going to grow it by $200 million. This, I hope, gives all of you comfort that we have done this in the past and that's what we are targeting to do in the future.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Neel.","Operator","Thank you. And we are out of time.

And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this -- our first quarter 2012 earnings call. This morning, I'm joined, as usual, by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer; and Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer, and both -- and you will be hearing from both of them, as they give part of this morning's presentation. Also with me in the room are Jason Few, who runs Reliant, the largest of NRG's retail companies; and Chris Moser, who's responsible for commercial operations at the company, and they will be available to answer your questions. ","So let's begin. Today, notwithstanding the market challenges that we faced during the first quarter of 2012, I'm pleased to speak with you about the state of our company and its prospects looking forward, and that's because it feels to me like we have reached, during this quarter, an inflection point in the commodity price down-cycles that have gripped the wholesale portion of our business since the great recession 4 years ago. ","We have a long way upward to climb just to get to mid-cycle, much less to an up-cycle, but looking forward, this is a very positive development for us. We have had to attack relentlessly against the headwinds of constantly lower commodity prices in order to produce reasonable financial results out of our wholesale business for 4 years. We look forward to have the commodity price winds at least partially at our back, as we seek to improve our financial results from the current $1.8 billion a year EBITDA trough that we are in. ","Regarding the first quarter of 2012, notwithstanding that we were significantly down on the spectacular cold-weather driven results we achieved in the first quarter of 2011, we are right on track with our internal projections for the year and as such, today we are reaffirming our full year 2012 guidance. The first quarter was interesting in that it showed the resilience of our integrated wholesale retail business model in a quarter where there was literally no winter weather anywhere in our geographic footprint at any time. ","The first quarter also showed what happens in the market when prompt gas falls below $2 per million BTU. The market and NRG experienced very substantial switching from coal to the natural gas. As a result -- but I think the question that all of you as investors have to ask yourself, is in a $2 gas environment, to what effect? When wholesale electricity power price off dirt cheap natural gas results in $20 to $30 per megawatt hour peak prices, as it did in the first quarter this year, then the obvious conclusion is that it doesn't really matter what year your portfolio is made up of coal plants or a natural gas plant. It doesn't really matter that the coal plants are running less and that the capacity factors of the gas plants are shooting it up because in a $2 per million BTU gas world, nobody is making much money running power plants, whether those plants be coal or natural gas-fired. ","For us, that's why I'm pleased that with each day and each passing quarter our business becomes more balanced on the 3 pillars of the first, multi-fuel multi-market conventional wholesale generation. Second, multi-brand multi-market retail electricity and third, an increasingly clean energy particularly, PPA-based renewable power. And all of those 3 segments of our business, as depicted on Slide 4, position themselves strongly during the first quarter of 2012 for a near-term growth, not just medium to long-term growth but near-term growth. ","So let's start with the wholesale generation, the foundation upon which we're building our customer-facing retail and clean energy businesses. When I alluded at the beginning of my remarks to an inflection point, signaling the bottom of the market with signs of an upswing in the early stages, I was not attempting to call the bottom of the market for near-term gas prices. Like a lot of market analysts, we would not be surprised to see natural gas prices go down even further over the next few months given the extraordinarily high levels of gas currently in storage. ","But near-term natural gas prices are not the point. Even though our stock price recently has traded in a high degree of correlation to near-term gas prices, as a result of our hedge program as Mauricio will demonstrate, near-term gas prices are amongst the least relevant of all commodity prices to our financial performance. The good news in the news that is relevant to our near-term financial performance is that the commodity price indicators, that are relevant to our financial performance, have risen and risen substantially and the fundamentals namely, the almost complete absence of a supply-side response in terms of plants under construction, suggest that these prices should continue to rise. ","Turning to Slide 5, you will see the Texas heat rate story. You have heard of more of this recently from analysts, as the market is beginning to appreciate that there are 2 sides to the wholesale price equation in Texas, natural gas prices and heat rates. In anticipation of what is shaping up as a very tight summer in Texas, we have been singularly focused, as a company, on preparing for the summer season. And certainly -- and while things can happen, we are as well-positioned as we possibly could be at this point in time. ","The South Texas 2 nuclear plant, after a long outage, is fully back online. [indiscernible] which missed all of last summer, as a result of a steam turbine failure, is back and running smoothly. In response to higher heat rates, we have brought back for the summer 3 units totaling 1,100 megawatts from mothball status. ","We had increased maintenance capital spend on our gas fleet in an effort to make them more reliable, in the event that they experience the extended runs in the many starts that they were subjected to last summer. And finally from a commercial operations perspective, we are going into the summer conservatively long in our overall wholesale retail position. ","Mauricio will go further into the details of the Texas story, so let me move on to cast some light on a couple of other tight supply and demand situations moving in our favor, in California and New York, as shown on Slide 6. In California, as many of you know, the San Onofre nuclear plant is experiencing some difficulty and is in the midst of an extended outage. SONGS, as is it is commonly called, acts both as a big southern anchor to the transmission system of the Los Angeles Basin and as a big northern anchor to the grid of San Diego County. With SONGS out, only one plant is well-positioned in that area and that is our Encina plant in Carlsbad, California. Encina has been experiencing significant runtimes already, and has performed magnificently and we expect that to continue. ","Once again, as what's demonstrated during the Southern California wildfires a few years back, the SONGS outage demonstrates the importance of maintaining a substantial amount of reliable generation locally. Similarly, our El Segundo Repowering Project strategically positioned on the grid near LAX, is progressing through construction on time and on budget and as such, will contribute to the company's bottom line in 2013. ","Turning east, in New York City, tightness in the market as a result of supply retirements away from NRG has caused zone J capacity prices to double in the past 6 months. Our Astoria and Arthur Kill plants are benefiting from this trend. As the state of New York moves towards a decision about the future of Indian Point nuclear plant, we are fully prepared to assist the state in providing system reliability and affordable energy with our fully permitted in-city Astoria repowering project. And with our underutilized baseload units located in western New York. In short, we see capacity payment upside for NRG in New York and that upside is not linked to the near-term price of natural gas. ","Moving on to Slide 7 and the retail assets we are building on top of our wholesale foundation. Reliant, our flagship retailer, continues to perform very well for us in our key ERCOT market. Not only did Reliant deliver another robust quarter in the face of less volumetric business, as a result of the mild weather, our Reliant continued its recent string of net customer additions and its industry-leading customer satisfaction scores. Green Mountain and Energy plus continued to deliver growth against their differentiated platforms of clean energy, in the case of Green Mountain, and loyalty and affinity-linked mass electricity sales, in the case of Energy Plus. ","Remember, it is our objective to build a suite of complementary retail brands that are able to compete successfully in the various retail markets that they compete in, on qualities other than just reduced price. And we are pleased with the progress being made in this end of our business. In the third leg of our strategy, the fast-growing clean energy space, as shown in part on Slide 8, NRG Solar continues well on track across a range of initiatives that it has underway. Most notably and most importantly, its utility-scale construction program remains well on track, on budget and well ahead of schedule. ","Last week in fact, we celebrated Agua Caliente officially becoming the largest operating solar PV plant in the United States, even though it is still something less than 50% of its eventual size. Agua Caliente, at this point, is several months ahead in its construction schedule. As you know, last quarter we sold 49% of Agua Caliente to MidAmerican at a premium to our invested and committed capital, demonstrating that even if the market does not see the value of the solar assets in our generation portfolio, Saudi strategic investors increasingly do, which leads me to my brief editorial comment for the morning for all of you on the investment side. ","I know that the solar space may look blighted with the loss of market capitalization over recent months with First Solar and the recent pulling of the BrightSource IPO. But that's because the public markets are overwhelmingly invested in the solar industry through the solar manufacturer link in the value chain, and that has been a very tough end of the business to be in recently. ","NRG, on the other hand, is not a solar manufacturer, but rather is a producer of solar power and is a consumer of solar module for effectively resale to businesses and consumers alike. That is a very different part of the solar value chain and one of prospects for which are extremely bright. ","As we turn into the second half of 2012, we intend to provide much greater detail about our plans to address this exciting market opportunity in solar. So finally let me end my opening remarks by making a few comments on capital allocation to reinforce the more conservable discussion we engaged in on this topic on our last quarterly earnings call. We reaffirm our intent to initiate a dividend in the third quarter of this year, which I don't need to point out to you begins 8 short weeks from now, and Kirk will provide some details that should allay concerns raised by some investors about the adequacy of the RP basket. ","Let me reiterate in a simple declarative sentence, the point that I made on the call last quarter when we announced the dividend. The RP basket will not act as an effective constraint on our ability to pay the proposed dividend now or in the foreseeable future. Moving on, we have not ruled out a share buyback in 2012\/2013, but as we mentioned last quarter, we want to hold off on any such decision until later in this year. In that regard, we will continue to reserve several hundred million dollars of excess cash on our balance sheet for a return to stakeholders, whether they'd be debt or equity, or both. ","Next, while it's premature to be too specific, we remain on track to realize during 2012, additional capital from the sale of non-core assets; capital which we believe can be put to better use for the benefit of NRG shareholders. Moving on, we will continue to look to add to the asset portfolio where it can be done at a value to NRG shareholders, as we felt we had done in every one of the limited number of acquisitions NRG has made over the past 8 years. So with that summary, let me turn it over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning. The first quarter proved to be a challenging one, but despite the mild weather across all our regions, gas falling below $2 and much lower generation, I am pleased to report that we continue to be on plan, thanks in large part to the execution of our hedging strategy. I will expand on these later, but as always, let's start first with safety. ","We had another quarter of top decile performance across the fleet. We have 47 facilities out of 51 without a recordable injury, and 0 loss time incident this quarter. Our safety culture continues to serve as the foundation for achieving superior operating results. Safety is a constant effort, and even with our strong track record, we cannot afford to become complacent, particularly going into the peak summer months. ","Moving onto our generation for this quarter, we were down 26% compared to last year. Most of this decrease was driven primarily by 3 factors. First, the forced outage at STP accounted for 1\/3 of the decline. I'm happy to report that unit 2 returned to service on April 24 and is running well. ","Second, we experienced higher coal to gas switching in Texas, particularly in January. However, since that time, we have seen improved dispatch on our coal units. And finally, we doubled the number of maintenance outage dates compared to last year. We opportunistically expanded these outages in order to take advantage of the low-price environment and to reduce outage-related overtime pay. The benefit of getting these outages done with little opportunity cost more than offset the negative impact on our availability metric. ","On the positive side, production in the West more than doubled compared to last year, led by our Encina plant, which has become critical to the Southern California grid given the SONGS outage. In the South Central region, production gains were driven by our Cottonwood combined cycle plants. ","As I indicated on the last call, this quarter we're launching a new FORNRG program. This time, the focus will be on asset optimization of non-economic units, as we deal with our Dunkirk facility; our retail business in recalibrating the cost structure to the low gas price environment. Our target is to deliver $100 million of EBITDA by 2014. ","Moving on to Slide 12, our retail business delivered planned EBITDA despite milder weather compared to last year, and it achieved another quarter of customer growth with 31,000 more customers than year-end 2011. We maintained strong retail margins with the disciplined approach to targeted marketing and pricing actions. However, unit margins were slightly lower due to intensified competition in C&I and the benefit in our mass segment from extreme weather events in February of last year. ","We continue to innovate, reduce bad debt and provide superior customer service as demonstrated by our growing customer accounts on the smart energy products and other value-added services. The result for the quarter is that we struck a balance between customer account and margin, consistent with our long-term strategy. And this strong performance enabled NRG to remain the largest retailer in Texas. ","Normally during these calls we focus almost exclusively on ERCOT and natural gas. But I thought it would be worthwhile to highlight a few other areas where we're seeing some upside not correlated with gas prices. So let me expand on David's comments on Slide 13. First on the left panel, in New York, the capacity market is a barometer for the balance of supply and demand. Without getting into the technical details of the demand curve, the key concept is that when supply and demand are in equilibrium, the cost of new entry will be achieved. ","What we're seeing, in both New York City and rest of the state, is that asset retirements are bringing the market back into equilibrium. Since October 2011, summer capacity prices have nearly doubled, with May spot prices clearing over $17 per kw month. Likewise, rest of state capacity has increased 150% over the same period. The market believes this increase is more than a temporary phenomenon, as 2013 prices have moved up as well. ","Moving onto California, the SONGS outage and the uncertainty around the timing of its return, coupled with normal in-state hydro levels have driven heat rates higher. In the past, most of our portfolio have been contracted or under tolling agreements, but not this year. Our in-base and merchant fleet of 2,000 megawatts is ready to meet critical summer demand and benefit from potential higher prices. Now moving onto Texas on Slide 14, an area that we have covered extensively is the market changes proposed by ERCOT and the PUCT. In September of 2011, heat rates and spark spreads have continued to increase, but remained below our estimates to support new build economics. ","Upon closer look, most of this increase in heat rates has come from on-peak hours during the summer months. As you can see, our baseload portfolio earns most of its margin during off-peak hours, irrespective of gas or low gas prices. And that is exactly where we have seen the uplift in heat rates. So we're confident that our low position will translate into higher margins. Given this price signal and the commitment of the PUCT and ERCOT have shown to make the energy-only market work, we have decided to bring 1,100 megawatts out of mothball status by June 1. We will bring this capacity to service at a fraction of the cost of Brownfield development. ","Finally, during this outage season, we have done extensive work to ensure a higher level of reliability of our gas fleet for this summer. Moving on to our hedging disclosure on Slide 15. As heat rate has become a more important and exciting driver of our portfolio, we wanted to increase the level of transparency of our baseload position, by including not only our natural gas, but also our heat rates hedge levels. Just to be clear, these levels are for the entire baseload portfolio and include the coal contracts in our South Central region. ","From these, you can infer our position in ERCOT is more open than the levels shown in this chart. Turning to coal, and given the weakness in the commodities market, we have increased our coal hedges in 2013 and 2014, effectively closing the second leg of our dark spread that we initiated back in December. ","We continue to work with our coal suppliers to have flexibility into our contract, in case we see a sustained low gas price. We have again included the sensitivity for both our baseload portfolio and our Texas gas fleet, which is shown on an open basis. As we have said in previous calls, with respect to our gas fleet, we continue to have a long bias positions for the balance of the year. ","Beyond 2012, and consistent with our view, our gas fleet remains significantly open. We believe these 2 disclosures will provide you with additional tools to value our portfolio. Finally, Slide 16 summarizes the goals for the operations group. We have taken all the necessary steps from a commercial and operational standpoint to ensure we capture the potential opportunity of higher heat rates in our core markets. With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Thanks, Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 18, NRG is reporting first quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $300 million, with $188 million from the wholesale business and $112 million from our retail platforms. ","The first quarter results which are consistent with our expectations, lead us to maintain our full year EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance ranges for 2012. Meanwhile, total liquidity improved by over $300 million, as compared to year-end 2011 liquidity, driven by the partial sale of Agua Caliente, which yielded cash proceeds of $122 million and a release of LCs representing the assumption by our partner, MidAmerican Energy Holdings, of postings related to their share of equity commitments for the project. ","As our business continues to evolve in order to better align our financial reporting with our management and strategic focus, NRG has realigned the segments of our business into 4 primary areas: conventional power generation, retail, alternative energy and corporate activities. Highlights by segment include the following: Beginning with conventional power generation, STP unit 2 returned to service on April 24, well ahead of the summer months; we have made significant investments in preparing our Texas gas fleet to respond to increasing market heat rates, including the return of 1,100 megawatts from mothball, as well as improved reliability of our gas fleet; and our Encina facility located in the West region, has already benefited from the ongoing SONGS outage. ","Turning to our retail businesses. As we continue to invest in the business, leading to an 87,000 year-over-year increase in customers, excluding the 200,000 customers we added as a result of the Energy Plus acquisition late last year, the increased customer count helped to offset the impact of mild weather experienced during the quarter, which led to more than 1\/2 of the retail EBITDA variance versus the first quarter of 2011. Finally, turning to alternative energy, as I mentioned previously, we completed the sale of a 49% stake in our Agua Caliente facility to MidAmerican at a premium, bringing up capital and underscoring the value of our growing solar platform. ","In addition, we received DOE approval to accelerate the block completion schedule for Agua, allowing us to bring online 110 megawatts ahead of schedule. With that, I'd like to turn to Slide 19. While first quarter 2012 EBITDA results were consistent with our expectations, those results were nonetheless $155 million lower as compared to the first quarter of 2011. And I felt it important to address both the components which led to this variant, as well as our expectations for the remainder of the year, which support our confidence in reaffirming 2012 guidance. First, the year-over-year variance in first quarter EBITDA resulted from the combination of both higher than expected results in the first quarter of 2011, and lower EBITDA in the first quarter of 2012, driven primarily by milder weather and higher planned and unplanned outages. ","Milder weather during the first quarter of 2012 contributed to more than 1\/2 of the decline in retail EBITDA. While the remainder was largely a result of increased marketing, as we continue to build our customer base into 2012. Conventional generation made up the remainder of the year-over-year decline due to a number of items, including planned and unplanned outages, maintenance to ready the gas fleet of the summer months, and lower realized prices in Texas and the Northeast. ","The right side of Slide 19 begins with 2011 actual EBITDA of $1.82 billion, in order to walk through the anticipated year-over-year changes leading to our reaffirmed guidance range for 2012. The year-over-year decline in the first quarter EBITDA will be largely offset by the absence of the impact of the extraordinary events on August of 2011, supported by our enhanced retail hedging activities, aforementioned investment in gas plant reliability, and a long bias in our peaking generation portfolio heading into the summer months. ","Our expectations for the remainder of 2012 included an approximate $100 million of reduction in baseload EBITDA, driven by a reduction in dispatch due to expected coal-to-gas switching, and lower average hedge prices partially offset by lower fuel costs. Next, we expect a $55 million increase in EBITDA from solar as projects come online over the balance of the year. The remainder of 2012 will also benefit from an increase in EBITDA from new businesses, including a full 3 quarters from Energy Plus. ","Greater benefits from increases in Texas heat rates that Mauricio discussed earlier lead to an expected favorable impact of between $50 million to $150 million. And finally, the potential uplift of $75 million resulting from cost savings from the launch of our new FORNRG program, as well as improved New York capacity prices and other items, lead to our reconfirmed 2012 guidance range. ","Turning to Slide 20, we expect -- we continue rather, to expect wholesale EBITDA of between $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion and retail EBITDA of $625 million to $700 million. Guidance for free cash flow before growth investments remains at $800 million to $1 billion. All of the first quarter saw an increase in cash collateral. This temporary increase does not affect our expectations for 2012 full year free cash flow. ","In fact, approximately half of the collateral posted during the first quarter was returned during the month of April, as higher hedge prices rolled off. And while we anticipate an increase in working capital as we proactively manage our coal inventory to capitalize on lower coal prices, this is offset by lower expected interest costs in 2012. ","Turning to Slide 21, through my conversations with many of you over the course of my first 6 months within NRG, and being mindful of the significant increases in non-recourse debt resulting from our expanding solar platform, I appreciate the importance of improving our guidance in disclosures regarding this important aspect of NRG's business. This growing business, still in its infancy and differently capitalized versus our traditional portfolio, does not lend itself readily to valuation metrics typically associated with our wholesale and retail businesses. ","However, it is currently subsumed within our consolidated guidance and balance sheet debt. This slide illustrates the consolidated view of both NRG's total balance sheet debt, as of March 31, approximately $10 billion, and our reaffirmed 2012 guidance ranges. However, the current solar debt balances, which outpace the current EBITDA contribution and distort the consolidated valuation metrics, are not apparent in this consolidated view. Turning to Slide 22, I have broken out the consolidated debt balance into recourse or corporate debt and non-recourse debt, as well as provided the EBITDA contribution to wholesale from these non-recourse subsidiaries, all of which are included in our 2012 guidance. ","Our solar platform represents the bulk of these non-recourse subsidiaries, and although there is approximately $1.6 billion of debt on our balance sheet associated with our solar projects, only a small portion of these projects are currently online and we expect them to contribute $65 million to $70 million in EBITDA for 2012. ","As all of these projects reach completion by 2014, the EBITDA contribution will grow to approximately $330 million. Our other non-recourse projects include our El Segundo repowering initiative, which although we have drawn approximately $200 million in construction debt, will only reach COD by August 2013. ","I'm hopeful that breaking out both the debt and EBITDA from these construction-heavy projects will permit a clearer means by which to have valued the mature platforms of our company. And while the value of our solar business is demonstrated by high teens and greater equity IRRs, the platform's value is further underscored by our successful monetization at a premium of Agua Caliente in the first quarter. And we will look to further demonstrate value in this way through similar partial monetizations going forward. ","As a frame of reference, the equity capital committed to these platforms before taking into account the premium value, is approximately $1.5 billion, which forms a very conservative basis for quantifying its value within NRG. Turning briefly to the committed growth investments on Slide 23, substantially all of the changes since our fourth quarter guidance update, are due to changes in timing and longer-term increases in our eVgo platform, associated with the previously announced plans for a California expansion. ","We now expect a total of $425 million of growth investments for 2012, which represents a $41 million increase over our February 28 guidance of $384 million. This increase is attributable to an acceleration of the timing of solar projects, due in large part to Agua Caliente, and which received the DOE approval to accelerate the block completion schedule, permitting us to bring 245 megawatts online during 2012. ","Partially offsetting this increase is lower spend on our new business investments primarily due to a change in timing of spend on our existing eVgo platform. For 2013 to 2014, we now expect a total of $389 million of committed growth investments, which represents an $84 million increase over our February 28 guidance. $65 million of the increase is attributable to conventional investments primarily in our eVgo spend in California, as well as a $19 million increase in solar projects due to modified timing of spend. ","Total liquidity for the first quarter remains strong at $2.4 billion, as you can see on Slide 24. Total revolver availability of $1.1 billion represents an increase of $468 million from year-end 2011, due largely to the impact of the Agua Caliente sell down I mentioned earlier, as well as the addition of the new repowering-holding facility, which increased LC availability by approximately $80 million. ","Turning to an update on 2012 capital allocation on Slide 25. Consistent with our reconfirmed guidance range, we continue to expect 2012 excess deployable cash of $700 million to $900 million and as indicated on our fourth quarter call, we will continue to reserve several hundred million dollars of this excess capital for the repayment of debt or the return of shareholder capital. We continue to monitor the impact of rising Texas heat rates, and hedged positions on our expected to credit metrics and will provide greater metrics -- greater specifics rather, regarding the allocation of this excess capital on our second quarter call. ","Importantly, as David mentioned, we continue to prepare for the expected initiation of our first-ever dividend beginning in the third quarter of this year. In anticipation of this, I'd like to provide an update on the status of our restricted payments basket under the more restricted covenant associated with our 2017 bond. ","As of the first quarter of 2012, the RP capacity under this indenture stands at $135 million or nearly 6x our anticipated quarterly dividend. Moving forward, the RP basket changes by 50% of net income plus 100% of the issuance of any stock and preferred shares or other cash changes in equity capital. ","During the first quarter, our RP capacity was positively impacted by the cash premium on the Agua Caliente sale, which resulted in an increase of additional paid-in capital. Future solar sell downs will positively impact the basket in the same way, while sales of certain non-core assets and also have the large impact based on total proceeds. Additional detail of the calculation of RP under both the 2017 indenture, as well as the EBITDA-based RP basket associated with our remaining indebtedness, can be found in the appendix. By way of reference, the RP capacity under the newer EBITDA-based calculation currently stands at over $2.7 billion. ","The sufficient existing capacity under the 2017 indenture, combined with both means at our disposal to increase that capacity, and further supported by the ultimate option to expand that capacity to a refinancing of the 2017s, provides confidence that as David mentioned earlier, RP will not be a constraint on our plans to pay the dividend. ","And finally on Slide 26, I'd like to briefly review my priorities for the remainder of 2012. First, capital allocation is a top priority at NRG, and we appreciate this is also a primary importance to our stakeholders. Second, as our integrated portfolio expands, managing the day-to-day liquidity needs of our business is also critical and supports our capital allocation's objectives, now and in the future. And finally, we intend to continue to enhance our excess capital by continuing to monetize the value of our solar business and selectively dispose of non-core assets. And with that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Kirk. Let me end as I usually do on the first quarter call with the scorecard, which appears on Slide 28, indicating what we are particularly focused on achieving this year at NRG. ","We have touched upon most of these objectives during the presentation today so I will not belabor them. I do want to say to all of the shareholders on the phone, that all of us in the management of NRG and on the NRG Board of Directors are acutely conscious of the fact that an investment in NRG during the past few years has not been a good one for our shareholders from a total shareholder return point of view. ","While I'd like to stand before you and guarantee that from this day forward, the stock price will go in only in one direction and that is up, I obviously cannot do that. I can tell you that, with near-term gas prices having the potential for only a little further drop on the downside, the gravitational pull downward on our stock price from natural gas seems to be near or at an end. And with the new shoots of spring that are popping up elsewhere around our conventional wholesale business, with the growing strength of our retail platform, and with large blocks of our industry-leading solar program achieving commercial operation over the next few months, we seem poised for a little upward momentum around the stock price. ","I also can tell you that all of us at NRG are doing everything in our power, everyday, to create that momentum and then to build upon it, all for the benefit of NRG shareholders. So thank you very much. Tahisha, we'd be happy to answer questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Cohen from ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question, what is the risk of a warmer -- sorry, a more mild summer in 2012? It seems like especially given all the investments that you're making, bringing units out of mothball and leaving yourself with a more open -- if we have a mild weather, aren't we leaving a lot on the table given where heat rates have risen to?","David W. Crane","Well, Jon, look I'll ask Mauricio if he wants to quantify, I mean, it's a good point. I mean, this is a business that's based on volume and we do better. We're supposed to do better in extreme weather environments and that's what we're prepared for. So an unusually mild summer in Texas would have a negative effect, but I think the amount is fairly modest. And Mauricio, do you want to -- I mean, it's hard to speculate specifically on how mild you're talking about, but if you want to venture or guess it...","Mauricio Gutierrez","No, what I would say is that the investments that we have made are not only just for one summer, Jon. I mean, we think that there is an opportunity for the next couple of years given the tight supply and demand situation in ERCOT. So I mean, clearly there is some risk of a mild summer. I'll say the position that we're taking to be longer than we have been in the past but again, I think you need to look at what is the perspective in the next 3 to 5 years.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And then just one other question on retail, can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics in that market. You mentioned that the competition on the C&I side was picking up. Is that for block products or for full requirements? And also for the guys that are marketing to the mass-market, that don't have peaking generation to back up their load, how is it that they're hedging the super peak risk in the summer?","David W. Crane","Well, Jon, Jason is obviously going to answer your question, but the second part of your question, I think is particularly interesting, because I can tell you we wouldn't want to be going into this Texas summer without the wholesale to back up the retail. But Jason, you want to answer both parts of John's question more thoroughly than I did?","Jason Few","Sure. When you look at competition on the C&I side, we are seeing a change in the product mix. We're seeing more customers taking block- and index-type products, which tend to, from a competitive standpoint, be more price competitive and at a lower margin. We're also seeing customers from a competitive -- or competitors in the marketplace driving price competition in the C&I space. So we're seeing both those things happen in the market and customers are willing to take more risk on their side of the ledger, as it relates to pricing given the current power prices in the market. On the other part of your question with respect to how retailers are going after the mass market, absent having the ability to be backed up by the fully integrated model like we have with generation, clearly, I mean, you're seeing that their prices from a cost standpoint are going up because of what's happened with heat rate. And I think as they work with their Sleeve Providers, I think you're going to see more cost for the smaller retailers or non-integrated retailers, as those prices increase in the market, and I know at least from a -- from an advocacy standpoint, we're seeing a lot of, at least feedback from the group not wanting to see the price cap elevations that the PUC is talking about, which clearly states that there are some challenges for them in terms of managing that side of their business. And we would expect to see pressure for them in terms of pricing, as well as their ability to have liquidity to support growth during the summer months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to start maybe with the reconciliation of the year-over-year change in earnings from Texas generation. Okay, so I understand that the February 2011 events contributed about $20 million to $25 million to your retail business. Could you give us a sense of how big of an impact did the Texas generation see in the first quarter of '11?","David W. Crane","So, Angie, I mean, just for other people following along, I mean, you're asking Kirk to provide a little bit more detail on Slide 19, right, in terms of, I mean, basically how much did 2011 first quarter outperform what we expected 2011 on a normalized basis, both on the wholesale and the retail side?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","That's correct.","David W. Crane","Kirk, if you want to give that answer?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, I mean, Angie, the wholesale side of that equation is effectively the difference between the $155 million and the variance that we had described being the retail side of that equation. So the wholesale side is about a $100 -- a little more than $100 million and the retail side is about $50 million.","David W. Crane","That's not the answer to it. She wants to know how much did 2011 first quarter outperform what we expected in 2011.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Oh, our expectations. Forgive me. We were up by about $65 million versus our expectations in the first quarter.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","For generation?","David W. Crane","For generation and retail. And you said $20 million, because retail was $25 million, so generation was -- assuming that Angie is right about the $25 million so...","Kirkland B. Andrews","And the remainder of that was $40 million, I think.","David W. Crane","Yes.","Kirkland B. Andrews","I didn't realize you were talking about the first quarter of last year. Yes.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's fine. And secondly, you mentioned coal-to-gas switching impacting the results. I'm actually a little bit surprised because if anything, it would have been a positive impact because you were hedged for baseload. You run your coal plants less, so you would have had a benefit of lower O&M from running the coal plants, and then you were buying power at a lower cost than it would have been -- than the cost at which you would have generated the electricity from your coal plants. So I don't quite understand why there would be a negative impact.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Angie, this is Mauricio. I think that it changes year-over-year, so in the first quarter of 2011 you got significant price spikes that we were able to monetize during that time. I think you're correct. There is an opportunity in this quarter where we bought back our obligations below our generation cost.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay, and lastly you mentioned accelerated maintenance of your -- of the gas plants. Any quantification of the O&M impact in the first quarter? So how much more in O&M did you spend to maintain the gas plants?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Well, on the O&M side of the equation, the number was about $7 million.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And the -- I promise this is the last question, the solar $330 million by 2014, what level of that will it be associated with for solar?","Kirkland B. Andrews","The tier 1 solar portfolio, once it reaches that levelized $330 million, the associated total debt will be approximately $3.4 billion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson from Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","David, in your preamble, you talked a bit about M&A, and there's always lots of rumors floating around there. I was wondering if you could address any of those rumors and if you're unwilling to do that, maybe just talk about your willingness to use your stock at current prices to execute upon that desire.","David W. Crane","Well, Jay, M&A is a broad topic. Let me just -- I think everyone just think about M&A the way we think about M&A, which is basically bifurcated. And I've made comments on both in the past, and let's talk about what I would call cash M&A in the past. And Jay, that's a very simple concept. I mean, this -- particularly the power plant side of the business, capital-intensive, commodity-based, cyclical business, it's very easy to demonstrate that the people who have made the most money in the power plant, these are the 20 years for the people who buy assets when they're cheap and they sell them when they're expensive. The points I've made in the past is that we're at a cyclical low point in the commodity price cycle. That's usually with assets are cheap. They problem is that the reason they're cheap is because there's very little money sloshing around to chase those assets. So the point I made on last quarter's call, is it's nice to have a little bit of cash in case you have an opportunity to buy assets at a low price. So that's the cash side. And I stand by the fact that we like to have a little extra liquidity to see if there are opportunities that fill out our portfolio. You also mentioned I guess -- I can't remember what you've mentioned Jay, you just [indiscernible] but corporate transactions are which implies using the company stock as an acquisition currency. And what I would say about that is, Chad tells me I've sort of fanned the flames of speculation in this area in the past, because we get asked these questions by investors all the time. And for some reason the way that investors ask the questions they say, do you think that if you put 2 independent power companies together, that there are significant cost synergies to be achieved? And of course, I answer that question in the affirmative that, that's incontrovertible. That if you put 2 IPPs together, there are big cost synergies to be achieved. And of course those cost synergies become more relevant in the scheme of companies, as their market cap shrinks. So the answer to that question is positive. But what I would say to you, Jay, is that you also have to keep in mind the other side of the question when you're thinking about NRG and large-scale acquisitions, which is we're obviously reluctant to use our stock as an acquisition currency at a time when it trades at a value that we believe is well below the fair value of the stock. And so never say never, but we do have that reluctance. Did that clarify anything Jay, or did that just obscure things further?","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","No, I guess it did clarify. I guess the way I'd punctuate it, is if you're looking down the potential, you're saying you never say never versus buying your stock back, and it's trading right now at 16, 13, what do you do?","David W. Crane","Okay, so -- I'm sorry.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I'm just asking you, you buy back stock at current prices? Or do you use it as a currency?","David W. Crane","Well, that's a hard question to answer. We obviously would like to buy back as much stock as we can at $16 because we think it's undervalued. But at this point, we look at the relative value of everything in terms of how much value it will create for the shareholders. So it's hard to answer that question -- I mean, we know what we think the stock is worth relative to the value we can create for the shareholders by doing share buybacks. I can't compare that to a theoretical use of the stock for an acquisition without sort of knowing what value could be created from a specific acquisition.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Right. No, I appreciate it. That's really helpful. And then Mauricio, just one last follow-up, the $7 million in O&M you talked about in the last question for additional maintenance, I assume that didn't include or only partially included the return from mothball, the 3 assets in Texas? So maybe just talk us through what the cost of returning those to service are?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes -- no, it did include some, but keep in mind that the full cost to return those units were -- I mean, there is a timing issue. It just didn't happen in the first quarter. There were some in the fourth quarter and some in the -- that are spilling over the second quarter. So it does include some, but it's not the total amount that we used to bring those units out of mothball.","David W. Crane","But the total amount of bringing those 3 back is what, $15 per kw, we'd say.","Kirkland B. Andrews","For the full year, the total amount of capital is about $15 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just want to follow up quickly on the last question, just on the cost to bring the Texas units back? So that was $15 million in total cost to bring these units online?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Over the course of the year, yes.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so that's obviously a very small fraction of new build cost. And what's the approximate heat rate of those units?","Mauricio Gutierrez","That heat rates vary between 10 through 13 heat rates. I mean, this is I guess, by 5 and version 1 through 4. Most of that cost was really around the boiler. We did expensive structural work and tools, we expect the generator. So the goal is really to make these units reliable for the next couple of years given what we expect as higher runs in the summertime.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then just on the sale of non-core assets, when I think about those assets, would the international assets be natural candidates there, and are they generally transactable assets?","David W. Crane","The first part of that, Stephen, is yes is the answer, astonishingly succinct by my standards of non-brevity. The second part is in terms of the transactability, as you yourself well know that those are highly structured transactions with partners and things like that. What I would tell you is, I can't guarantee that they're transactable now, but they appear to be a lot more transactable now than they were 2 or 3 years ago. And so we're optimistic. How is that?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question here on the lower interest expense in the guidance, just if you could walk through. It's a pretty big delta there, as far as I'm concerned, $45 million?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, Julien, the principal component of that change in expectation is the result of lower LC costs, that are the combination of the new facility that we put in place at repowering holdings, were primarily the release of the LCs that resulted from the sale of Agua Caliente.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right, and a follow-up there on the '17 notes just again, kind of following up on the M&A discussion, how are you thinking about timing on potentially refinancing those that this year versus potentially transacting and how would that play into it?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, looking specifically at the 2017 note refinancing, I would look at that at this point as -- they're primarily driven by the attractiveness or the refinancing cost we see in the market place. So that would be governed by the degree to which we see an opportunity to refinance them at attractive rates. And obviously as you've seen over the course of the last few months, we've seen some significant volatility in the trading of our bonds. At some point, those rates go as high as 9%, sometimes they go down closer to the 8% range. Obviously, lower is better, so as we move closer to an attractive range of refinancing cost, that would be the driving factor that would cause us to make that decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill from Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could come back to the Texas availability in the quarter and I think you mentioned that you brought forward some maintenance plan, maintenance days, and maybe you can touch on sort of the difference between where you would have wanted to be in a normal quarter of availability and how much of that was made up by bringing forward those maintenance days to where you ended up?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Right, I think we quantify that, Gregg. I mean, we doubled the number of outage days compared to the first quarter of last year. When I -- the color that I will provide is when our coal units are significantly in the money, every megawatt hour counts, and we try to shorten the length of the outage by paying some overtime. In this case, since the opportunity cost was minimal, we decided to extend the outage to avoid paying those costs, and so that was one of the main drivers. The other one was, be opportunistic about bringing some additional outage work that we needed to do. I think in the subsequent quarters, we will provide additional guidance on what that meant for the remaining of the year in terms of the reduction of planned outages.","David W. Crane","Yes, Gregg, just to add to what Mauricio said, I mean, while it was most pronounced in Texas -- I mean, that was really a philosophy that we took across the generation fleet because really there was so little money to be made on the wholesale side during the first quarter. That the normal paradigm that the plants operate on is that you got to get these outages done in the shortest possible time. It really made it  -- it didn't make sense to rush plants back into service so that they could produce megawatts at 0 margins. So some of the statistics don't look as good in that way, but the opportunity cost, as Mauricio is saying of keeping the plants out, just didn't exist. So we made sure that everything got all the work done that needed to get done.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, I'm still struggling with the idea that your long capacity against the retail business in Texas heading into the summer, with Slide 15, maybe you could hit that again for me? It just looks like you're hedged on baseload, so -- and not pulling on price for the load, and so is it just with the gas assets, are getting into a net-long position?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Right. Well, let me see if I can elaborate. I guess, you're referring to the green bar on the baseload generation chart?","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Okay, the green -- what that means is that, we are fully hedged against our price load or where we have certainty on our retail business in terms of price. There is a portion that we still have no certainty on price. And we know we have that low, it is -- for the most part, these are the month-to-month customers that we try to hedge as we are approaching the delivery dates. So what we have said in the past is we run flat book on retail. All the price load we hedge it, and the variable component, which is the month-to-month customers we had a programmatic way of hedging that, as we approach to the delivery month. Would that clarify that bar chart?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of things. David, I thought I heard you say in your prepared remarks that the $1.8 billion or so EBITDA this year is a trough. Is that? Did you say that? Is that what you expect?","David W. Crane","Well, it's not a formal multi-year guidance of the company, but certainly that's what I expect, yes.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, because I think there's a lot of expectation that there's further decline as hedges roll off and retail margins maybe shrink over time?","David W. Crane","Yes.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But is that...","David W. Crane","Well, I mean, the marketplace is made up of people with different expectations. So -- and -- but I mean again, I'm looking at this, Steve, as a 3-pillar thing. There's -- I'm not saying that it's -- that this is the bottom. And when you mention hedges rolling off, you're obviously talking about something that is going to impact the wholesale side of the business. I mean, we do have a natural built-in uplift that comes in from the solar, the $300 million plus of EBITDA that was referred to earlier, I think by Angie, and discussed with Kirk. So there are -- I'm looking at the totality of the picture, not just the wholesale side.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, but I just wanted to confirm that, that was the comment you made. It's not just like prices are at a trough, it's the EBITDA that's at trough.","David W. Crane","Yes, I mean, my goal is that not withstanding this downward pressure in prices with hedges rolling off, that between solar, between the heat rate expansion, better capacity prices, the retail expansion both in terms of adding customers in the markets we're in and expanding the markets we're in the Northeast, that I don't want or expect to see the company to do worse than $1.8 billion. Again, and that's not formal guidance. That's just -- that's David Crane speaking.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, secondly, did you just give us an update on like, coal inventories and is there any risk that you end up having to force-burn any coal?","David W. Crane","Force-burn coal. Mauricio?","Mauricio Gutierrez","I might have rested there. Yes. A couple of things. One, we certainly are above the -- or on the upper end of our range. But what I will say is most of the coal-to-gas switching happened in the month of January. Since that time we have seen an increased number of ramps in our coal generation particularly in Texas, so at this point, we don't expect to be forced to take any coal. And the second thing that I will add is -- and we're working very close with all the coal supply chain participants and it's been a very constructive discussion. Coal suppliers want to ship coal to us. They want to sell coal. Railroads want to ship coal, and I think we're all trying to make sure that coal stays competitive on a cost basis and that they provide us enough flexibility in case we see a sustained low gas price environment throughout the summer. So I think the combination of those 2 things makes us comfortable managing our inventory for the balance of the year.","David W. Crane","Yes, I mean, Steve, Mauricio said it quite articulately, but I just want to make sure that everyone on the phone hears what Mauricio said because in the 8 years that I've been running this company and there's a lot of talking about the coal supply chain and difficulties with it. But I have never seen a situation where the whole coal supply chain was working as constructively with each other as it is now, and I want to commend those upstream from us on the coal supply chain for working with us to make sure that coal is as competitive as it can be in this natural gas price environment. The final thing I want to say, Steve, is it's good to have you back on the calls.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have one more question, though. You spoke too soon. And I'm not sure you can answer this, but you're probably aware there's one party in the dispute with PJM regarding the application of Mopar for a new plant in this auction. Can you comment on whether that's you?","Mauricio Gutierrez","I mean, the only thing that I will say is we have not been notified on anything and, I don't believe -- we can't comment on it. So I mean, that is pretty much all I can say. Everything else will be a speculation.","David W. Crane","So thank you all for taking the time this morning to join us on this call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Liz. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's first quarter 2017 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts.","As this is an earnings call for NRG Energy, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","Let's start today's call with our Q1 results on slide 3. Today, we are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $412 million and reaffirming our full-year financial guidance for 2017 of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Our operational execution remained outstanding during the quarter. First and foremost, we achieved top decile safety performance, which is a testament to our ability to focus on our most critical objectives.","We also maintained our focus on our key strategic priorities reducing cost, optimizing assets and balance sheet management. We announced the deactivation and mothball of 1,600 megawatts of generation, reinforcing our commitment to constantly optimize our portfolio given changing market conditions.","We continue our prudent approach to growth and capital recycling with a dropdown of the Utah Solar and 31% of our interest in Agua Caliente assets for $130 million in total proceeds. And today, we are announcing the offer of our remaining 25% interest in a large portfolio of wind assets from the ROFO pipeline to NRG Yield.","Finally, the Business Review Committee is well underway in its evaluation and is making good progress. All businesses are engaged and we're working diligently to provide an update to the market as soon as possible.","Turning to the right side of the page, I want to take a moment to identify and explain the key drivers for the quarter and touch upon our path to full-year guidance. Kirk will provide additional details later in the presentation.","Let me start with the first quarter results. As you can see on the chart, the decreasing adjusted EBITDA year-over-year was driven almost entirely by the Generation business. The roll-off of higher priced hedges that were executed after the polar vortex of 2014, lower capacity revenues in the East and a few known one-time items accounted for almost 75% of the total decrease. These items were included in our guidance as we had identified 2017 as a trough year and had guided to a lower full-year result compared to 2016. The other 25% was the result of mild weather with renewable resources and advisory fees.","Taking this first quarter result and our current outlook for the year, we're now trending towards the lower half of our guidance range. We expect to update our guidance once we have more clarity on the BRC and GenOn processes.","Now shifting focus to our operational metrics on slide 4, as you can see, the organization remained focused on our day-to-day operations despite ongoing internal initiatives and weak market conditions. I am particularly proud of our safety record, as we delivered another quarter of top decile performance. This is a testament to our strong safety culture and excellence in operations where 142 facilities out of 158 operated without a single reportable injury.","Total generation was down 9% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven primarily by lower generation in our gas and oil units and the East coal plants. This was partially offset by increases in production from our coal units in the Gulf Coast due to higher wholesale prices. Our traditional availability metric, EAF, was up from last year following the completion of an intense two years of repowering and environmental compliance outages.","Although EAF increased, it doesn't tell the full story of NRG's ability to capture value when economics justify. So we introduced our In the Money Availability metric last quarter. We believe this is an improved measure of our ability to manage and balance operational performance, margin at risk, and spend while in this low commodity price environment. Our results demonstrate our ability to have units available to capture value when it matters.","In our Retail business, we continued our growth. Our sales were up in both our retail mass and C&I segments where we acquired an additional 14,000 retail mass customers over the quarter, bringing us up nearly 87,000 customers year-over-year. Although margins were down slightly due to mild weather and changing customer mix, our growth in customers and customer count helped us maintain volumes.","We now turn our attention to the important summer months, and I remain confident in how we have positioned both our Generation and Retail businesses in each of their respective markets.","Turning to slide 5, we outline the key trends on how we have positioned our portfolio in each of our core markets. As I've described in the past, we have come a long way in diversifying our earnings, both in terms of business lines and our portfolio composition. Today, almost three-quarters of our estimated 2017 gross margin comes from sources that are not directly correlated to the price of natural gas. This diversified base of earnings drives our platform and is enhanced by the regional strategies we take in each of our markets.","So let me start with the Gulf Coast. We continue to see strong growth across the region and are encouraged by the fundamental dynamics, particularly in ERCOT. Given the energy-only market structure and integrated platform of Generation and Retail, it's necessary to mitigate price volatility and deliver sustained value. From a market perspective, given the persistent low commodity prices in ERCOT for almost five years, we do see a heightened risk of both new generation being delayed and accelerated retirements that could tighten the market sooner than expected.","In the East, the market continues to be centered around capacity and providing reliability at the lowest cost. Over the years, we have pivoted our fleet to focus on reliability and benefit from capacity prices while maintaining a cheap option on energy. We continue to seek opportunities to balance our generation portfolio with more retail and enjoy the benefits of an integrated platform, but we will only do that at value while recognizing the limitations of the East retail markets today. We're also encouraged by the full implementation of the capacity performance construct in the upcoming PJM auction, which creates a natural market tightening through more stringent reliability requirements. But while we believe the market construct itself can be affected, we are concerned about the recent out-of-market payments that keep uneconomic generation from leaving the system. I will be speaking more on this in a few minutes.","Finally, in California, regulatory policy continues to support the decarbonization of the state's economy with a focus on renewables, quick start gas, controllable demand and increasingly energy storage. In this market, our assets are well positioned inside load pockets and have benefited from repowering opportunities. In California, we have brought online or developed over 2 gigawatts of renewables and 2.5 gigawatts of quick start gas over the past five years. This past quarter, our Carlsbad project PPA became final and non-appealable, and construction started in February.","Moving on to slide 6, the fundamentals of the ERCOT market remain strong. Load growth continues to outpace the rest of the country. On a weather-normalized basis, it has averaged over 2% over the past 12 months. And as you can see on the left hand chart, ERCOT has achieved higher peak loads with lower temperatures over the past few years. The new forecast by ERCOT for 2017 puts peak demand 2.5% higher than last year and a high demand case close to 8% that is 5,000 megawatts higher. At the same time, we've experienced energy prices for the past five years with little-to-no scarcity premium.","This market dynamic is putting significant pressure on both new builds and retirements, as you can see on the right side of the page. There have been a number of delays or cancellation of projects, as developers fail to justify new investment at current prices. For example, the three thermal projects slated to come online for the summer of 2018 have not yet indicated that they have begun construction and are unlikely to achieve commercial operations prior to next summer.","Now, turning to retirements, ERCOT has historically understated the actual number of megawatts leaving the system, as you can see, from the period between 2009 and 2016. Looking forward, we see the same anemic estimate for retirements in the reports, assuming only 840 megawatts between 2017 and 2022. In April, we announced that Greens Bayou 5 will go into mothball status, thus 371 megawatts alone leaving the market. And we believe that there are close to 5 to 6 gigawatts of already identified generation at risk today in the market.","As we look at the future reserve margins in the high-teens, we cannot help, but think about the higher loads, less new builds and more retirements quickly tightening the market and creating scarcity conditions. In our view, ERCOT remains the most attractive market in terms of market fundamentals, but we need to see significantly better price signals before we can start deploying additional capital.","Now turning to the East on slide 7, NRG margins remain challenged given low natural gas prices and new efficient generation, but we maintain our positive outlook on capacity markets, particularly in PJM, which implements the first 100% capacity performance auction later this month. In this construct, the higher reliability requirement will create challenges for the megawatts that cleared in previous auctions as base capacity, including less reliable generation and demand response. These resources will have to make a decision between taking themselves out of the market or pricing in a higher reliability premium.","While we see positive changes like the capacity performance construct in PJM and other East markets, we are concerned about increasing activity by the states to undermine the integrity of competitive markets. Out-of-market subsidies and contracts distort pricing that was needed to attract new capital investment, but often raising prices for the end users. We and a number of other parties have filed legal challenges to the nuclear subsidies in both New York and Illinois because we believe they're not legal and because regulators should focus on crafting competitive solutions for public policy objectives.","We are encouraged by the support from PJM, its market monitor, other generators and consumer groups. You can expect NRG to continue to be a leader in these efforts to protect the well functioning of competitive markets.","So, with that, I will turn it to Kirk to talk about the financial results for the quarter.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to financial summary on slide 9, NRG delivered $412 million in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter, Generation and Renewables delivered $95 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter while Retail and Yield contributed $133 million and $184 million.","As Mauricio discussed earlier, our first quarter results relative to 2016 were impacted by a combination of expected changes as well as other unexpected variances. As shown in the chart in the bottom half of the page, approximately 75% of the quarter-over-quarter change in EBITDA was anticipated and occurred in our Generation segment. The majority of this anticipated variance was a result of the impact of lower realized energy margins including the roll-off of higher priced hedges in 2016 combined with the one-time impact with the sale of emissions credits. The remainder of this expected change in the Generation segment was due to a combination of lower year-over-year capacity prices as well as the shift of hedge revenues from 2017 to 2016 as a result of the early monetization of hedges at GenOn.","The remaining quarter-over-quarter variance was primarily due to the impact of milder weather, which affected all four of our major segments during the quarter. Our Retail business was primarily impacted by lower margins resulted from a combination of milder weather and higher supply costs while both NRG Yield and Renewables saw below-normal solar insulation and wind speeds, primarily in California. The milder than the normal weather for the quarter also impacted the Generation segment, particularly in the East. And finally, we saw additional G&A expenses due to advisory fees largely associated with the newly formed Business Review Committee we established late in the quarter.","Turning to the outlook for full year 2017, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for the year of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $800 million to $1 billion in free cash flow before growth. However, taking into account the first quarter results and our current outlook for the balance of the year, we are currently tracking toward the lower half of these ranges. Importantly, as Mauricio noted, this outlook does not yet reflect the impact of the BRC and GenOn processes. We anticipate having clarity on these processes and their resulting impact on guidance in the near term.","Turning to slide 10 for a brief update on 2017 NRG-level capital allocation, having now closed on the dropdown of the Utah assets and the partial interest in Agua Caliente to NRG Yield during the quarter, our capital available for allocation stands at approximately $1 billion. And having now offered our remaining 25% stake in the TE Wind portfolio to NRG Yield, we are focused on completing this transaction later in the year to further augment available capital at the NRG level.","Our planned capital allocation for the year also remains unchanged including approximately 70% allocated to debt reduction to further strengthen the balance sheet. We expect to execute on the bulk of this de-levering in late 2017, as we approach the maturity date of our 2018 notes as well as more attractive pricing on callable debt. With growth investments and shareholder dividends unchanged since our previous update, we continue to anticipate approximately $75 million of excess capital yet to be allocated and we'll address the expected use of this excess later in the year.","Finally, slide 11 provides an update on 2017 corporate credit metrics. There are two changes to highlight since our last update. First, during the quarter, GenOn drew $125 million under the secured intercompany credit facility with NRG. NRG in turn funded this via a draw on our corporate credit facility in the same amount. The draw under the intercompany GenOn revolver was the result of a drawdown on the $125 million letter of credit posted by GenOn in support of GENMA. Although this drawdown was a result of a claim of default by the owner lessors, GENMA disagrees with the default claim and the associated drawdown on the letters of credit and is in the process of pursuing its rights and remedies. Although we view this drawdown on the NRG revolving credit facility as temporary, pending the resolution of this dispute, we have updated our corporate debt balance as well as the GenOn-level total debt to reflect the $125 million increase.","As to the second change, turning to the right side of the slide, given the lower than expected first quarter results, primarily at the GENMA and REMA subsidiaries within GenOn as well as additional costs associated with the ongoing restructuring process, we are reducing the GenOn midpoint of the adjustments to our midpoint EBITDA guidance used to arrive at corporate-level EBITDA.","The net impact of these changes on corporate credit ratios, however, is very minor, as our resulting 2017 gross corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio is now 4.17 times versus 4.13 times in our prior quarter update. As we began last quarter, we've also shown this ratio on a net debt to EBITDA basis, which remains under 4 times.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kirk. And in closing, you can see on slide 13 that we have made good progress against our key priorities this quarter. With respect to GenOn, we continue to evaluate all options available in advance of the upcoming bond maturities on June 15 of this year with our primary goal of negotiating a comprehensive solution to satisfy our stated core principles. We, along with GenOn, remain in active dialog with GenOn's creditors while we continue to evaluate and pursue a broader range of possible outcomes. To that end, GenOn recently appointed a new dedicated CEO to assist in these ongoing efforts. I expect to update the market in the near term.","As I look into the summer and beyond, I am confident in our ability to deliver strong results across our well diversified and integrated platform with a philosophy of continuous improvement.","Thank you. And with that, operator, we're ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So when I look at the slide 3 and also I look at page 9, although you haven't given specific \u2013 you haven't called out specific numbers, but it looks like weather and advisory fees could have been numbers approaching $75 million to $100 million of variance in the quarter, is that within the realm of reasonableness or not because if it is, it looks like, all things equal, you probably would have had a decent quarter, had you not had those things that were out of your control?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, Greg, it was actually around the $100 million. A quarter of that was advisory fees, and if you look at the two drivers of the remaining, it was a really the mild weather that affected Retail and Generation, and it was the lower wind speeds and solar insulation that impacted Yield and Renewables.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. And so on page 11, again just I think you were pretty clear, the low \u2013 slightly higher gross and net debt to EBITDA is purely a function of where the quarter came in and where you are on the guidance range.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Greg, it's Kirk. That's true with respect to the denominator because we basically adjusted out less with respect to GenOn. It's really the numerator component of that, as I indicated earlier, that we did increase the corporate debt just associated with that drawdown under the intercompany revolver, which NRG in turn funded by drawing its own revolver.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Sorry, I had to top off on the call for a second, so I missed that. What is the \u2013 can you give us \u2013 this is my last question \u2013 sort of a specific expectation for a timeline on when the business review will be complete? Should we expect that update to come in conjunction with the Q2 earnings call or if it comes to resolution prior to the earnings call with a significant enough margin of time, would you do a separate disclosure?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, Greg, I think we're making really good progress inside the BRC. As I mentioned, the entire companies are engaged, all the businesses are engaged. As you all know, we have a now (24:52) date of August 15, but we're working as diligent as we can to be able to communicate to the market as soon as possible. So if that merits \u2013 if we come to a conclusion and if that merits a standalone call before the earnings call, we will do that. My objective is to communicate that as soon as we have resolution and really not waiting for a quarterly earnings call. So if we have something to say, we're going to say it as soon as we can.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. I actually do have one more question, sorry, on Retail since you have your retail guru on the call with you. There's obviously been a significant move by your competitors to enhance their retail sales channel capabilities. We're also in an environment with very low volatility and very low pricing. Your customer count was up in the quarter, but your EBITDA results were lower. Are we starting to experience a significant amount of competition for certain types of customers and how should we \u2013 if that is a reason why (25:56) we factor that in?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, that's a good question, Greg. And before I pass it on to Elizabeth, just to make sure on the quarter, if you can see, we actually have milder weather and wholesale prices quarter-on-quarter were higher. So that really and naturally that compresses our gross margin, but in terms of the competitive landscape on Retail, Elizabeth, can you answer the question?","Elizabeth Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.","Sure. Thank you. I appreciate the question. So I would say right now, we are not seeing any more competition than we have historically seen and NRG's retail engine is very strong. We have great momentum in both customer acquisition and retention, demonstrated really by our customer growth. Once again, we grew 14,000 customers in the quarter. Mauricio mentioned, last year in Texas alone, we grew by 87,000 customers. Every one of our competitors is looking at declines of some level and that customer growth actually mitigated the impact that we would have seen otherwise.","On your question around margins, we do see some margin compression when we look at customer growth because if we decide to grow in a particular pocket, we will be willing to accept customers at lower margins if they deliver strong EBITDA, and because of our scalable platform, we're able to take on those customers and grow from there. So we do make trade-offs. I don't think that anything that's going on in the competitive dynamics is driving material compression in margin. And while we did see some compression largely associated with weather and a little bit associated with customer mix, we're still strong in our momentum at maintaining our margins and only when we take deliberate action will we see some compression, but it's going in eyes wide open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Elizabeth Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thanks for the question.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","(28:05) is ready now. Sorry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Julien.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, so, quick question to the extent possible, can you give us a little bit more of a sense on how to think about the puts and takes in your 2017 EBITDA guidance as you reflect the GenOn and BRC updates? I suppose obviously being at the lower end, should we be thinking about GenOn as a net degradation and then the BRC to the extent to which that some of the cost-cutting initiatives can have an effect in the back half of the year that that could be an offset to GenOn and keep you at least at the low end, if not push you up? I'm just trying to get a sense of what the factors you would be updating here are as you think about it.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Well, I think you've mentioned the two big events that we have coming up, which is the BRC process and GenOn. GenOn clearly could have a significant shift in the composition of our portfolio. And the BRC, as we said before, their focus is \u2013 or our focus right now is on the cost initiatives, asset optimization and capital allocation, which is very consistent with how we approached our priorities last year in 2016. I think what you should expect is additional cost savings or cost reductions, just like we did in 2016 over $0.5 billion, most of it recurring. You should expect the continuation of that in 2017, but as I said before, I think we need to let the process work. I don't want to front-run it. We're all working very diligently and we're making really good progress, but I think the way you should think about it is additional cost initiatives and all the other decisions that we make will be towards creating shareholder value or maximizing shareholder value.","Kirk, is there something else that you want to add?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","No, not a lot more to add, Julien. Obviously, GenOn is an outcome-dependent situation, but there are significant costs associated with the provision of shared services and inclusive of that change combined with any reasonable anticipation of any cost coming out of the BRC process, as you implied which I'd agree with, that would be certainly a net positive relative to the outlook because we haven't embedded any of that into our current outlook that underpins our guidance.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Said differently, the loss of dissynergies of the GenOn breakup, if that is indeed what ultimately happened, you have confidence that at the back half of the year, the BRC could offset that.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","I think that's fair. The combination of those two outcomes assuming any reasonable amount of cost cutting above and beyond GenOn should be a net positive vis-\u00e0-vis our outlook today.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Second quick question, development related on the Renewables side. You added 1.3 gigs to utility scale and DG pipeline in the quarter, which seems pretty meaningful especially given some of the, I suppose, wider conversations around what you intend to do with your development renewable activities under the BRC. Can you comment what those additions were and then just talk about your commitment to the specific aspects of the business?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, the increase in the pipeline as I mentioned to you, after we integrated, post the GreenCo process, after we integrated our Renewables business and have stabilized that group, I think you can see the results here, not only with the acquisition of SunEdison, but really increasing our pipeline of projects. Keep in mind that these pipeline of projects are in various stages of development. I will say that most of them are really on an early stage development. And this is an important driver for Yield. We are a significant owner of Yield, and as we can provide more clarity on assets that we can drop down, it just enhances the value of Yield, which enhances the value of NRG. So I think that's the objective that we have and the mandate that I've given to the Renewables business. We need to continue growing that pipeline.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. It would seem as if you're talking about early stage projects and expanding capital deployment in the early stage, that would actually suggest furthering your efforts on this front as you just said, enhancing the pipeline?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","I think when you talk about capital deployment, keep in mind that most of the capital deployment around Renewables is transitory because we have said before \u2013 we have set it up as a quick capital replenishment, so redevelopment and then we very quickly turn it to Yield or sell it down to Yield to replenish capital and redeploy that at NRG. So, just keep that in mind, this is not permanent capital.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Absolutely understood. Thank you all very much.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just a couple quick questions.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Mauricio. Any sense of the \u2013 how much the advisory fees are expected to be for the year, when you've kind of updated to lower half?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, as I mentioned, the first quarter was about $25 million. And what I will tell you is that it's hard to pinpoint right now the exact fees that we're going to have because it's going to depend on the outcome of both the BRC process and ultimately the path that we get to GenOn, but what we have embedded right now in our guidance is it's under $50 million.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And by itself, that pretty much gets you into the lower half per the numbers, I guess. Secondly, do you have \u2013 a lot of the hit that you were expecting this year occurred here in the Q1 even without the weather and the like. What kind of helps you \u2013 the hit later in the year is just a lot less than it was in Q1. Is that just that the hedge roll-off is not as dramatic, capacity payments get better, I guess, is there any other kind of key items that limit the hit later in the year again before BRC?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Keep in mind, as I said, the big driver here was the roll-off of high priced hedges that we actually put post the polar vortex of 2014. So if you remember, after the polar vortex, all the winter strips re-priced right after that, the 2016 and 2017 winter strip completely \u2013 or the 2015 and 2016 re-priced. And most of that \u2013 the uptick that we saw post polar vortex were exactly in the winter months. So, that's why the largest impact was in this quarter. I think as you progress in the year, that's going to subside. And the other thing that I will say is we've always identified 2017 as the trough year. So I think as you move in the outer years at current market prices, I think it's fair to assume that the outlook for commodity prices improve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And that's without any BRC benefits and and the whole thing (35:50)?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","That is correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So I wanted to \u2013 I know you are not giving us the specific date when you're going to announce the results of the pending review, but given that it looks like Texas is going to be particularly tight this year and maybe next, and you will be potentially making decisions regarding asset optimization in the markets, how do you think about it \u2013 that you would have to make those decisions before you see any type of summer-driven volatility in power prices in Texas?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I think, first of all, as I said, the BRC \u2013 well, good morning, Angie, first of all.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","And I think when you look at the focus of the BRC, one is cost initiatives. And given the low commodity price environment, I think it's fair to assume that we will continue our focus on reducing cost and that's somewhat independent of a particular season or particular summer. Of course, in every decision that we make including the evaluation of all our businesses inside the BRC, we're looking prospectively at the markets. We're looking at the current curve, we're looking at the sensitivity around it, and that's what is going to inform the decisions that we make at the BRC and ultimately the recommendations that we give to the board. So I don't think we are looking prospectively and I think that's the point that I want to make, Angie. This is not just a single point and marking a special decision against a curve. We are actually stressing different scenarios to understand the total composition of the portfolio and the sensitivity of the portfolio.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then on the GenOn. So GenOn has the new CEO, was appointed before the upcoming PJM capacity auction. How should we think about it? Should we think that this appointment somehow changes GenOn's bidding strategies, how do you think about the way these assets should be bid into the auction given the fact that you might not operate them or own them still?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, Angie, I will say that the appointment of the new CEO, I think, in his responsibility is to review and be responsible for ultimately the bidding of these assets. Now we continue to provide shared services agreement including asset management, commercial \u2013 the wide range of shared services agreement that we give to GenOn, but as we have done in the past, we provide a recommendation and the commercial team gives them their perspective, but ultimately it's going to be the new CEO's responsibility to determine how that portfolio is going to be bidding to the market.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And my last question, I promise. The DOE study about the importance of base load assets, how does it play into your business review, if at all?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, I think everything is taken into consideration on the Business Review Committee. We have said in the past that one of the strengths of our portfolio is the diversity of our merit order, base load merit and peaking. So clearly, if there is something that focuses on recognizing the value of base load, then we welcome that, but I want to be crystal clear, it has to be in a way that doesn't jeopardize the integrity of competitive markets and we have to find ways to find the right competitive pricing to ensure the reliability of the system and that every single one of the resources is fairly compensated for the services that he provides to the group, and I think that has been our approach.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","We have time for one last question. This question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just want to follow up on Angie's question on asset rationalization and just at a high level when you look at your fleet and you look at the market outlook today, is it your sense that there are opportunities to \u2013 or maybe not opportunities, but sort of if that it makes sense to think about some shutdowns of assets just given that they're not really economically viable or is this something we should be waiting for as part of the broader BRC update you'll provide later in the year?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, let me just start with our retirements because I've been very clear in the past. Our business is not to keep uneconomic generation running. We have retired a significant amount of generation that we felt was unprofitable and didn't have good prospects. Just last month, we retired Greens Bayou 5, 370 megawatts of capacity in Texas. And earlier in the year, we retired Pittsburgh in California. So I think the combination was close to 1,500 megawatts of generation. So when we have an uneconomic plant, we will move quickly and swiftly to take it out of the market.","And of course, as part of the BRC, we're doing a holistic review of the portfolio. There are opportunities and I think we demonstrated that last year. We sold three plants. We monetized them over $0.5 billion of asset or sale proceeds. I think there is an opportunity where perhaps another counterparty has a different view on commodity markets or can create a \u2013 or looks at value differently than us and we will execute on that. But as I said, I think as part of the \u2013 with that respect, I don't want to front-run the BRC process. When it comes to asset divestitures, I think we need to let that play out. We are having good and very constructive conversations inside the BRC. And as I said before, we're moving as fast as we can because I am the first one who wants to communicate this to the market. So you have my commitment that as soon as we have something to communicate, we will tell you.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very much understood. That's all I had. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Steve.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","And thank you all for your interest at NRG.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Joelle. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's third quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com, under Presentations and Webcasts.","Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation, as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law.","In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation.","And now with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG.","Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer and also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","I'd like to start the call by highlighting the three key messages for today's presentation on slide 4.","First, we continue to demonstrate the earnings predictability of our integrated platform. We are narrowing our 2018 earnings guidance to the upper half of the range and initiating 2019 financial guidance above our transformation plan pro forma.","Second, we achieved a significant milestone in our efforts to right-size our business by closing on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. With the transformational plan, asset sales and cost savings nearly behind us, we're now pivoting to margin enhancement in 2019.","Finally, we are announcing an incremental $500 million share repurchase in addition to the $1 billion announced earlier in the year. This brings our total share repurchase program to $1.5 billion and completes our 2018 capital allocation plan.","Moving to our third quarter business update on slide 5, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the third quarter, we delivered $677 million of adjusted EBITDA or 23% higher than last year. This was primarily driven by higher realized power prices and continued execution on accretive cost savings initiatives while achieving top quartile safety results.","I am very pleased with the operational and financial performance of our integrated platform during a period of extreme price volatility. As we have discussed with you in the past, during periods of high prices, our Generation business benefits while our Retail business experiences some margin compression. It is exactly in this price environment that our platform demonstrates the benefits of the integrated model.","Our year-to-date result now stand at $1.58 billion, a 34% increase from last year, allowing us to narrow our 2018 guidance range to $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion which is at the upper half of our previous range when adjusted for asset sales. This is also the first quarter that our financial statements start reflecting our new simplified business model. Our total corporate debt is now at $6.5 billion or almost 60% lower than the previous quarter. This number includes $640 million of deleveraging completed in the last two months.","During the third quarter we also launched the second $500 million share repurchase, following the close of NRG Yield and Renewables transactions, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the fundamental value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time.","Looking ahead into 2019, we're initiating adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion. This range reflects the strong fundamentals in our core markets and the confidence we have in achieving our transformation goals. This is yet another example of the stability and strength of our integrated platform, which will provide close to $2.6 billion of excess cash to be allocated in 2019. Later in the call, Kirk will provide additional details on both guidance ranges.","Turning to slide 6 with our transformation plan update; we continue to execute on the plan initiatives during the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full-year 2018 targets. Through September 30, we have realized $375 million in cost savings, $24 million in maintenance CapEx reductions and $6 million in margin enhancement. Over the remainder of the year, we will continue to focus on executing our cost savings and maintenance CapEx programs, while ramping up our margin enhancement initiatives.","We continue to put in place the foundation for realizing margin improvement through multiple avenues, including expanding sales channels and products, streamlining transactions and enhancing IT systems for more sophisticated customer analytics.","With respect to asset sales, during the quarter, we closed on the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables. We expect to close South Central by year-end as it is moving through the approval process with the LPSC and FERC, and Carlsbad will reach COD in the fourth quarter and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.","We are also narrowing our asset sale proceeds from up to $3.2 billion to $3.1 billion. This is the result of having only Agua Caliente as the remaining assets with clear line of sight to close by year-end 2019. All other assets will remain in the portfolio at this time, given the improving market conditions. Finally, we are well on our way to achieve our leverage target of 3 times net debt to EBITDA by the end of 2018, after having executed our deleveraging objectives.","Now, turning to slide 7 for a closer look at this summer; as you can see on the slide, weather was warmer than normal across our core markets, which led to higher demand, particularly in Texas, where we set a new record peak load of 73,000 megawatts. While loads were robust, actual prices were mixed across markets compared to expectations.","In ERCOT, real-time prices came in significantly lower, as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. A combination of near perfect performance by generators during the July heat wave and milder temperatures in August resulted in prices 77% lower than it was expected at the beginning of the summer.","In the west, California was a different story with prices settling well above expectations. This was mainly due to restricted gas deliverability. Looking ahead, we observe that the combination of once-through cooling unit retirements and the emergence of community-choice aggregators have resulted in recent increases to Western capacity prices. In the east, energy prices were pretty much in line with expectations and the focus is really on market reforms of both capacity and energy.","Now looking forward on slide 8 and starting with our market outlook for ERCOT; as we have seen over the past year, reserve margins continue to tighten, driven by load growth, asset retirements, and additional delays or cancellations or new builds as developers are unable to justify long-term investments.","On the top left-hand chart, you can see that reserve margins continue to be significantly below ERCOT's target for several years, highlighting the need for additional generation. Currently, the PUCT is considering positive changes to the ORDC scarcity pricing mechanism, to ensure the right price signals are sent to market participants. These potential regulatory changes, combined with low future reserve margins have pushed forward prices higher, particularly in 2019 and 2020.","This move has been almost entirely driven by increases in the summer prices, where the market is now implying between 8 to 9 hours of prices at the cap. We have actually taken this as an opportunity to increase our hedge levels in 2019 and 2020, providing us with even more predictability on our earnings going forward.","One area worth noting is that most of the current reserve margin is made up of capacity that comes from renewable generation. As you know, this is non-dispatchable capacity and therefore could potentially lead to fluctuations in the actual amount of generation available to serve load.","Now moving to the East, the focus is on regulatory changes for both capacity and energy markets. As you know, FERC has stated that the existing capacity market in PJM is unjust and unreasonable, due to the negative impact of subsidized units.","Let me reiterate that we believe a strong MOPR is the simplest and most effective way to reduce the harmful impact of subsidies on the capacity market.","PJM and New England are also focusing on fuel security, which should lead to additional revenues for generators that have on-site fuel capabilities. This is very much at play, but all these regulatory changes are designed to improve the current status quo and are positive for our portfolio.","Next month, it will be three years since I became CEO of the company and while this is not the quarter where we provide our capital allocation plan, I wanted to spend a minute talking about our capital allocation philosophy and track record, particularly in light of the financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves in the past few years.","Turning to slide 9, you can see our capital allocation for the past three years. As you may recall, we initially focus on stabilizing our business by selling or closing underperforming assets, focusing on our core integrated business and strengthening our balance sheet. This resulted in most of our excess cash to be allocated to debt reduction in 2016 and 2017.","With the announcement of our transformation plan and the rightsizing of our business, we created significant excess capital that we returned to our shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases given the undervaluation of our own stock.","As we move into 2019 and given the excess cash potential of our business, which will be close to $2.6 billion even after the incremental $500 million share repurchase announced today, I want to reiterate to you that we will be absolutely disciplined in following our capital allocation principles that we have articulated to you and that you can see on this slide.","I look forward to providing you with our 2019 capital allocation plan on the fourth quarter earnings call as we have done in the past.","With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Mauricio.","Turning first to the financial summary on slide 11, for the third quarter, NRG delivered $677 million in adjusted EBITDA, a 23% increase over last year. Having successfully closed the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables in August, our quarterly and year-to-date results now no longer include the contribution from these businesses, which are now treated as discontinued operations as a result of the sale.","Through the first nine months of 2018, NRG has delivered nearly $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA with approximately $375 million of cost savings realized, which places us on track to achieving our 2018 cost savings target of $500 million. With these solid results and the important summer months now behind us, we're also narrowing and revising our 2018 guidance toward the upper half of our previous range, which I'll discuss in greater detail shortly.","With the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables transaction, combined with $640 million in discretionary debt redemptions which I'm pleased to announce, are now completed, we have now removed approximately $10 billion of debt from NRG's balance sheet in 2018. This not only significantly simplifies NRG's balance sheet for our investors but makes the achievement of our 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA target in 2018 all the more transparent.","As you'll recall, part of our plan to achieve our target balance sheet ratio in 2018 included $640 million in debt repayment, which we achieved following the third quarter in two parts. First, in October, we redeemed the remaining $485 million balance of our 2022 senior notes, eliminating our nearest maturity in the process. Second, we repaid $155 million of our term loan facility. We are required under the terms of this facility to offer a portion of the proceeds from certain assets sales to the lenders at par. In keeping with this requirement, we have made this offer, and through an arrangement with a financial institution, effectively capped the amount of redemptions for which NRG is responsible at $155 million, which represents the balance required to achieve our debt reduction target for 2018.","As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we have now fully funded the second phase of our $1 billion share buyback program. Following the closing of NRG Yield and Renewables, we put in place a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR with a financial institution. NRG initially received a base number of shares which will be supplemented with additional shares based on the average price of our stock over the program. The financial institution is continuing to execute share repurchases under the ASR which will be completed by the end of 2018.","In addition, we now have a new authorization for an additional $500 million in share purchases which will be executed between now and into 2019. This brings the total amount of 2018 excess capital allocated to share buybacks to $1.5 billion or nearly 40% of our 2018 excess capital.","Turning next to an update on our 2018 guidance which you'll find on slide 12, given the significant impact of deconsolidation, resulting from asset sales and our reported results in 2018, I'd like to first take a moment to provide you some context of our revised 2018 guidance. Looking at the table at the top of the slide and moving from left to right, we start with our previous guidance for 2018 which has remained unchanged since we first provided it about a year ago.","That consulted guidance, included the expected full-year contribution from all of our businesses, including those which have now been sold. As you may recall from previous quarters, we have disclosed to you the full-year impact to the midpoint of our guidance from these 2018 asset sales which included everything we've closed on to-date such as NRG Yield, Renewables and our Boston Trading business or BETM, as well as our South Central business.","Following the closing of South Central, which we continue to expect toward the end of 2018, the results of this business will also be treated as discontinued operations and will not appear in our results for the year. That second column reflects the midpoint EBITDA and free cash flow from these businesses based on our prior guidance or $1.2 billion and $590 million in EBITDA and free cash flow respectively.","Deducting these amounts from our prior guidance allows you to see the contribution to that prior guidance range from businesses retained in 2018, which is reflected in the third column entitled, previous guidance adjusted for asset sales. This should provide you some context and reference for comparison for our revised 2018 guidance shown in the last column on the right.","Based on the performance of our remaining businesses and our expectations for the balance of the year, our updated and narrowed guidance for 2018 is $1.7 billion to 1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion of free cash flow. Importantly, this revised guidance reflects the upper half of our previous guidance range adjusted for asset sales.","Finally, at the bottom of the slide, there are a couple of items to note with respect to our 2018 revised guidance, which should also provide you some context when I review our 2019 financial guidance in a few moments. First, our revised guidance for 2018 still reflects the contribution from Agua Caliente, which we expect to sell to NRG Yield or Clearway in early 2019, as well as the partial year contribution from BETM, which was sold during 2018.","In total, these two items represent approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA included within both the Generation segment, as well as our consolidated revised guidance. As BETM has now been sold and we expect Agua Caliente to be sold early in 2019, neither of these two items will contribute to our results going forward, and are thus not included in our 2019 financial guidance.","Second, as you recall, we closed on XOOM Energy in mid-2018, which we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our 2018 results. However, as we indicated when we announced the XOOM transaction during Analyst Day, we expect the full-year impact of XOOM to be approximately $45 million and our 2019 guidance reflects that.","So, with that as a backdrop, I'd like to turn to 2019 guidance which you'll find on slide 13. 2019 will be the first year since we announced the transformation plan that our financial results will reflect our retained businesses and are simplified and further strengthen the balance sheet. Our guidance for 2019 is $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with $850 million to $950 million from Generation, and $1 billion to $1.1 billion from Retail. In the upper right of this slide, we provided a walk to help you understand our 2019 EBITDA guidance compared to our previous 2018 pro forma that was based on our original 2018 guidance.","Our previous 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which was most recently found in our second quarter presentation, was $1.6 billion. To bridge to the $1.95 billion midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add two items. First, our 2019 guidance reflects the incremental impact of transformation plan initiatives versus 2018, which totaled $195 million. As you may recall, this consists of $500 million in 2018 cost savings, increasing to the $590 million run rate in 2019, and $30 million in 2018 margin enhancement which increases to $135 million in 2019.","Second, to arrive at the midpoint of 2019 guidance, we add $150 million, which reflects the combined impact of increased power prices in 2019. Specifically, these increased prices benefit Generation EBITDA, just partially offset by higher supply costs that they represent for Retail. While we expect these higher supply costs to modestly impact 2019 Retail guidance, we expect them to be recoverable beyond 2019.","Next on slide 14, I'd like to provide a brief update on 2018 capital allocation. As usual, you'll find all the changes to this update versus the update we previously provided in the second quarter, highlighted in blue. As you can see, primarily driven by a $500 million increase in capital allocated to share repurchases, which reflects a reserve for our new buyback authorization. We have now fully allocated our 2018 excess capital with approximately $80 million of total capital allocated toward our deleveraging targets and returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share buybacks.","The remaining changes since our last update are summarized in the upper right of the slide, and primarily consists of the following: First, as shown in Item A, based on discussions with NRG Yield or Clearway and the expected COD for Carlsbad later this year, we now expect to close on the sale of that asset in the first quarter, which shifts about $365 million in capital from 2018 to early 2019.","Next, based on the increase in 2018 EBITDA, which positively impacts our leverage ratio, we are able to reduce the temporary cash reserve needed to achieve this ratio in 2018 by approximately $150 million. This is partially offset by about $45 million of debt premiums and fees associated with both the $640 million in debt redemptions I've mentioned earlier as well as other liability management activities year-to-date.","Finally, we have reduced the expected allocation to transformation plan cost to achieve by $60 million, which we now expect to incur as a part of 2019 cap allocation, which I'll review next on slide 15.","Turning to 2019 excess capital on slide 15, we begin with capital available of $1.4 billion, which is comprised of the midpoint of our 2019 free cash flow guidance plus about $70 million of unallocated 2018 capital from the previous slide.","Next, we add $485 million in 2019 asset sale proceeds, which consists of approximately $365 million for Carlsbad and $120 million for Agua Caliente. Both of which are expected to close in the first quarter. Next is the full release of the remaining $915 million in 2018 cash temporarily reserved to ensure our 3 times ratio.","Our higher midpoint EBITDA for 2019 allows us to fully release this remaining balance next year for capital allocation, as we will not require any excess cash in 2019 beyond simply our $500 million minimum cash balance to achieve our 3 times net debt to EBITDA ratio.","I'll review all of this in further detail on the next slide, however it's important to note that as you may recall, our previous expectation, which was based on our pro forma cash walk was with \u2013 that we would still need to reserve about $450 million in capital or cash in 2019 for credit ratio purposes, making this capital previously unavailable until 2020.","Our more robust EBITDA reflected in that 2019 guidance allows us to release this capital for allocation effectively one year earlier than previously expected, and is the reason why although we've now allocated an additional $500 million toward share repurchases, our cumulative excess capital through 2019 remains unchanged from our previous walk at $2.6 billion.","Finally, turning to an update on our corporate credit metrics on slide 16. In column one, we've updated our 2018 ratio calculation, to reflect our increased revised pro forma EBITDA, which again allows us to reduce our 2018 cash reserve while maintaining three times net debt-to-EBITDA.","Our pro forma 2018 debt reflects the third quarter balance reduced by $640 million in debt redemptions now completed, leading to $6.5 billion in total corporate debt at year-end 2018, which, after deducting our minimum cash of $500 million and $950 million of additional cash temporarily reserved in 2018 leads to $5.1 billion in 2018 net debt.","For debt ratio purposes, we have adjusted our midpoint of our revised 2018 guidance range to reflect the removal of EBITDA from asset sales which still remains in our 2018 guidance, specifically Agua Caliente and BETM. And we've also added $20 million to adjust for the full year effect of XOOM. In total, this net adjustment of $100 million leads to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for ratio purposes of $1.65 billion for 2018.","As we've done in prior quarters, we continue to adjust the EBITDA for ratio purposes, to reflect the impact of Midwest Gen capacity modernization which will only be necessary through 2019 as that is the final year of capacity sold forward, after which, we will count 100% of Midwest Gen EBITDA towards this ratio.","Turning to 2019, as I mentioned earlier that $300 million increase in adjusted EBITDA based on the midpoint of 2019 guidance allows us to fully release that remaining $915 million of cash reserve, or basically three times the increased EBITDA, making this cash available for further allocation in 2019, while permitting us to maintain that important three times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.","Finally, as a reminder, in 2020 we still expect an additional $80 million in EBITDA for margin enhancement programs which increases to $215 million in 2020 versus $135 million in 2019. This additional upside, combined with the strength and resiliency of our integrated Retail and Generation platform, helps ensure that we can maintain and improve on our credit metrics without the need for additional capital in 2020.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kirk. A few closing thoughts on our 2018 scorecard on slide 18. As you can tell, it has been quite a busy year so far and we have made excellent progress across the board on our 2018 priorities. I am very pleased with what our team have been able to accomplish. As I look forward to 2019, we're focusing our efforts into three key areas, redefining our business by further perfecting our integrated model; shifting the focus of our transformation plan to margin enhancement and completing the announced asset sales; and finally, disciplined allocation of the significant excess capital that we will have available.","I am very excited about the future of our company. I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. So, with that, Joelle, we're ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, team. How are you?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, excellent. Hey, wanted to follow up a little bit on just the hedges here. I wanted to understand a little bit what's going on in Texas on 2020? There's been a little bit of a change in the weighted average hedge price there on a per-megawatt-hour basis. It seems as if you've largely kept the hedge percentage intact, but if you could elaborate a little bit here?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Sure. Well, as we were discussing \u2013 I mean, we're seeing power prices increase in 2019 and 2020. We actually have taken this opportunity to increase our hedges, and you know, most of the move has been around the summer. So, you can expect that the hedges that we have put in place have been really around the June through September strip. But, Chris, I mean, are there any \u2013 anything else, more details around our hedge strategy and then some of the dynamics you're seeing particularly in 2020?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I think when we're looking at hedging, we're looking at trying to lock in good numbers against the expected generation with the idea that we'll still leave some \u2013 you know, to cover up operational risk and load variability, obviously in combination with buying options, and weather options, and outage insurance, and the rest of that. What you probably \u2013 and we can dig into this later, Julien, but what you're probably looking at is, is as we try and take off the summers, especially in 2019, we were also doing longer dated pieces, not just summer. Those are done at a lower level. Obviously I'm selling April off-peak or around-the-clock, that's going to move the number down a little bit.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. So, that explains the move from $42 to $36?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The bulk of it. Okay. Excellent. And then just secondly here, Mauricio, I mean, I think folks are taking note this morning of some of the changes on the board, but I also take note of your commentary earlier with respect to continued execution of the transformation plan. You've announced for the first time here, your 2019 full-year EBITDA, how do you think about continuing some of the cost savings that we've seen in 2018 into 2019? How do you think about what's reflected and ultimately, is there anything to be read from the changes on board here \u2013 I mean, on the board composition this morning too.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, I don't think there is anything to read on the board composition. The entire board supported the transformation plan, including myself. Management is committed to executing our transformation plan and I think we have done excellent progress, with the \u2013 John decided to step down from the board and what I can tell you is that he's been a good and insightful board member and I look forward to continue having him as a long-term shareholder.","So, I think we have the support from our shareholders in terms of our transformation plan, the direction that we are \u2013 that we're going. Did that answer all your question, Julien? I know that it was \u2013 I think a two or three-part question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, I \u2013 yeah. Well, I mean, maybe the \u2013 to be a little bit more direct about this, how are your transformation plans shaping up for further cost savings into 2019? Obviously you're holding on to a few more assets than you originally anticipated; does that provide for incremental cost savings and are you continuing to evaluate that at a board or even within the company from a cost savings perspective?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. So, with respect to the cost savings or on the transformation plan, we have line of sight on the $590 million. We're executing to that and that's going to start doing in \u2013 we're going to do that in 2019. Obviously, our cost savings, this is something that is a continuous improvement process. It doesn't end with a transformation plan. We're always looking at doing things more efficiently. So, we're going to continue doing that.","And if there is an opportunity to reduce the cost on some of the assets that we're retaining, believe me, I mean, we are already looking at that and then evaluating that.","So, I am very confident that we're going to achieve our numbers by \u2013 in 2019 and I am very confident also of the culture that we have on continuous improvement that I believe, you know, before transformation plan was for NRG and this is something that we all feel very strongly. So, I don't think you should expect that, you know, after the transformation plan this is basically done and over.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you all.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, guys. It's actually Phil here for Greg.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Greg.","Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC","Phil. But...","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Phil, I'm sorry. Phil. We're getting a little echo here on our end.","Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Let me try to adjust my headset. Anyway, congrats on the quarter. I just want to clarify a couple of items you discussed. So, to be clear, the incremental $500 million announced today, that's not allocated, it's not eating into the $2.6 billion CAFA that you're allocating for 2019.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","That is correct.","Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC","So, theoretically, if you were to use all that for buybacks, you can allocate north of $3 billion from here.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. I mean, the $500 million plus $2.6 billion, yes, that's correct.","Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. In the 2019 guidance you laid out, is that marked to end of the quarter curves?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes.","Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So is it fair to say that where we sit from here today that curves look still a little bit better on a fresher mark-to-market or how are you \u2013 what are you seeing...","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. I mean, I would say that they are just a tad better, but keep in mind, when you're looking at the 2019 guidance, you have to take up a few things into consideration. Number one is power curves; number two, the level of hedges that we have. So, I mean it's not just one, and obviously supply cost for our Retail business. So, I mean, there's multiple things that you need to take into consideration, so it's not just one-dimensional.","Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And I guess to that point, I mean, yeah, Kirk, your commentary on Retail essentially with the higher wholesale prices going into 2019, you won't be able to capture that 1:1 on the Retail side next year, but as you move through time, you can start to work that into future rates. So it's kind of a margin lag. Am I thinking about that correctly?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. That's correct and I mean, let me just \u2013 I mean as we have seen different prices is going to change a little bit the distribution between Generation and Retail in our earnings, but keep in mind, I mean from my perspective, what we are focused on is having an earnings profile that is stable and predictable for the integrated platform.","So, if power prices are increasing, it benefits power generation business perhaps more than any part of Retail business and truly it's the other way. So \u2013 but at the end of the day, what we are focused on is the total earnings line of the integrated platform, and this is what we want to demonstrate, you know, the stability and predictability of our platform, which I think, we have done in 2018 and with the guidance we're providing today, it's a reaffirmation of that.","Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC","Sure. And you've done a good job of that so far for sure. Last question, and then I'll cede the floor. Can you just provide any color or commentary around the 2020 trajectory from here, relative to 2019?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","I mean, what I will tell you, since we're only introducing 2019 guidance today, is, some of the drivers that you should be looking at for 2020 obviously is power prices, the hedges and something that Kirk was mentioning, which is, you know, some of the compression that we get by higher power prices in our Retail business. But aside from that, I will not \u2013 obviously, if the assumptions are the same in 2020 than in 2019, then you can make an inference of that.","Obviously, you also have the incremental transformation plan targets that we have going in 2020, but I'm not going to \u2013 I'm not going to \u2013 and I'm not going to be providing 2020 guidance in the call.","Phil Covello - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Thanks, guys. Congrats.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Abe. Good morning.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. With the backwardation in the Texas prices, at least the ones that are quoted right now, can you remind us what Retail's positive sensitivity is for lower prices, you know, absent the margin enhancement program?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we haven't provided the specific sensitivity on our Retail business because \u2013 I mean, there is a number of things that come into play; it's not just the cost of our sales, but also you have to look at where your margins are, your attrition rates, your bad debts. So, it's not \u2013 I wouldn't say that it's as direct or as directly correlated as CDC in the Generation business.","I mean, there is a lot more variable that needs to be taken into consideration. So, I think what I will tell you is, the benefits that we see on the Generation business tends to be one-to-one when power prices increase, and we have ability to pass some of that to our Retail customers, so, it's not one-to-one. That's why we say our Generation business tends to benefit more than it impacts our Retail business, but that's \u2013 I think that's the dynamic that \u2013 and the complementary nature of our business. And that's the level of detail that we're comfortable providing.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then on 2018, the implied Q4 guidance is a lot lower than Retail and Generation have done in the prior years; is there something unique about this year in Q4?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","No. Nothing unique at all. It's kind of difficult to extrapolate from there, because remember \u2013 and again I'm not sure if you're referencing, when you talk about Retail and Generation, those two being the significant component parts of our overall performance in our guidance. In the past, Retail is basically same store from that perspective, but as a reminder, Generation, which we used to call Generation & Renewables for an obvious reason, included everything.","So, I'm not sure whether you're accounting for the fact that we've significantly streamlined and changed the overall makeup of the portfolio, but in the context of the assets that remain, which is a phrase or a term that I used in my remarks, fourth quarter is in line with what we would normally expect. Just a lot of noise with things moving in and out this quarter.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So, two questions. So, one is, in the past you've mentioned that you were planning to acquire some retail businesses in the Northeast. Well, you haven't announced anything yet and just wondering if we're waiting for cash to come in from the Louisiana assets or if there's any other limiting factor here.","And also, if you could put it in the context, so you have $2.6 billion in cash to be allocated. I understand that there are only really two ways to allocate it; one is that retail acquisition and the other one is buybacks, and is it safe to say that given the size of retail books that are available, only about maybe $700 million of that could be spent on Retail?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Angie. So, let me tackle your \u2013 the first part of your question. Just to be completely clear, what I have said in the past is that we're going to be looking at perfecting our integrated model. In the East, we have more Generation than Retail, so we can actually achieve that rebalancing in two ways. We can either grow our Retail business or we can reduce our Generation business. Both are available to us, and we know that the retail space has been very active, but \u2013 and if we see something that is consistent with our portfolio and meets our capital allocation and hurdle rates, then we're going to evaluate. But there are different ways that we can perfect our model, and we're not locked in or \u2013 to one specific one.","To your second question around what we can do with our excess cash in 2019, I would say that there are three different ways that we can allocate it. One, we can always find opportunities to grow our portfolio, our business, if they are compelling. Two, we can return capital to shareholders both ways, share buybacks, given the undervaluation of our stock, it is today and as a preferred one, but we also have another avenue, and we are open to it if it's dividends.","And then finally, we also have to evaluate, you know, continue paying down debt, and while we are completely comfortable with 3 times today, that doesn't mean that, in the future, it's something that we just set it and forget it. So, that's what I would characterize our capital allocation for 2019 or at least the philosophy.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And on an unrelated note, Midwest Gen, so, PJM will be reforming its MOPAR rule. It does sound like Illinois might be leaning towards stripping out all of their nuclear plants from the PJM auction, keeping the Illinois customers basically neutral as far as their capacity payments, which I understand, that the capacity payments would be coming then from coal plants like the ones that Midwest Gen owns. So, in that context, how do you see the earnings power of this portfolio going forward?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Okay. Chris, do you want to take that?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Angie, for that to happen, you need to believe two different things. You need to believe that Illinois is willing to quintuple the number of nuclear subsidies that they're already providing from 2,000 to give or take 10,000, which is hopefully a stretch. And then, you also have to believe that FERC will allow a state to subsidize one particular set of generation and crush wholesale prices, which is in direct opposition to what they've written in the past \u2013 previous three orders. So, I mean I think that's very theoretical, and I think there's a lot of wood to chop to get from here to there.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So, I mainly wanted to get to the hedging a little bit, and link that with the drop we saw in the 2020 hedge prices. I guess you talked about, and we all know about the tight reserve margins in ERCOT; given that tight reserve margin, I would guess that your preference would be to keep it more open to benefit from tightening prices in the curves in 2020, and clearly the curve is right now are backwardated.","So, I guess, just wanted to understand more broadly the hedging policy views, and then secondly, a little bit more clarity of the almost $6 drop in 2020, kind of what prompted that hedging if you're kind of seeing this more broader tightening in ERCOT?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Okay.","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Praful, Chris again. So if you're looking at back on page 24 and you look at total Generation portfolio, when you look at the open heat rate, you'll see that 2020 went from pretty darn low to 27%, and nuclear went from relatively low to 36%. So what you have is two different moving pieces here.","What you've got is a big hunk of hedges that went in, that were arguably not just summer, but they were full year, on-peak around the clock kind of numbers. And you also have the lot of small numbers which is, if you have a small number that was only summer, and then you mix that with a full year piece, which was, you know, and that second quantum was bigger than the first quantum, you're going to get a move there. Trust me, when we're selling 2020, the summers are included. So we're locking in \u2013 we're locking in big chunks of value.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's helpful. And so more broadly, just understanding the 2020 and just the hedging policy in general, is there a view that ERCOT is going to tighten further and that curves don't reflect that today and you want to keep more open or do you feel that the curves are relatively opportunistic or wherever there is an opportunity, you would go in and lock in further hedges?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","No, fair question. I mean, I think if you look at the position where we're sitting, 30% \u2013 basically 27% to 36% hedged depending on which chunk of the portfolio, coal and nuke or total, you know, I think that we're saying that this thing has some room to run, so we're only 27% hedged.","Now, I will say that we've seen a nice price rally since the summer and there's plenty of expectation that the PUCT, later today, may make some changes to the ORDC pricing mechanics and we're hopeful that they do because newbuilds are either being pushed off or cancelled. So, something needs to happen and we \u2013 I encourage the PUCT to take action.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Praful, and let me just add; in 2020 we are 70% open. I think that should give you an indication, our view in the Texas market. We continue to see that is very constructive, but we want to be prudent. We saw a pretty significant increase in 2020 on prices. We reacted to it, we were opportunistic, we laid out some hedges, but keep in mind, we're still 70% open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's helpful. And then just on capital allocation more broadly, clearly there is both a growth opportunity and a potential to buy back shares. From a growth perspective, is Retail the only direction you see or are there other avenues of growth that we should be thinking about, that will hit your return thresholds that you could also kind of look at?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","I mean there is \u2013 we see multiple avenues. I mean, clearly the one that has been getting more headlines is Retail, just because of the value proposition where Retail is today, the implied valuations that we have, and the fact that we can actually put it in our Retail business that is scalable. So, we can achieve significant cost synergies.","But we see opportunities in other areas, we're evaluating them particularly on the business \u2013 business solutions side, working with our customers, and the one thing that I will say is Generation perhaps is limited, given the very long-term nature of the investments and the fact that we have \u2013 we're adhering to our capital allocation principles.","So, I would characterize it that way and that informs more or less where we start we're looking at \u2013 where we are looking at possible opportunities.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Super helpful. Thank you, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. First up, Kirk, I guess just wanted to clarify the slide 12 numbers you gave us, as you walked from the pro forma to the actual guidance for 2018. So, if I read that right, there's about $145 million of EBITDA that you're adding back in for the BETM and so on and so forth, but the midpoint of the two adjusted guidances only went up by $55 million. So, what am I missing there in that math?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","I think the way that you've summarized that is effectively correct, right? Nominally speaking, you have a significant \u2013 a more significant increase, but thinking about it \u2013 and perhaps this is where you're going \u2013 thinking about \u2013 ignoring the nonrecurring elements, right? When I talk about nonrecurring elements, I'm talking about Agua Caliente, I'm talking about the BETM, the Boston Energy Trading business, which still is reflected in our numbers even though it was sold intra-year.","Yeah, you've got about $50 million of sort of same-store outperformance, which is why I characterize it as towards the upper half of our previous range on an apples-to-apples basis, right? That was part of the reason why I unpacked that because, nominally speaking, relative to the $1.6 billion pro forma, it looks like $150 million higher, but when you adjust that for the asset sales, your number is probably the right way to think about that on a same-store basis \u2013 if that makes sense, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. But then, Kirk, if you take it to your next column, the updated and narrowed guidance column, you know, that number \u2013 shouldn't that \u2013 if you took the column before that, this previous guidance adjustment column, and moved right, shouldn't that have gone up by that $140 million that you're adding in there?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","No, it's the opposite.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. I'll come back to you guys on that.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I know we'd get a follow-up call, but I'm happy to try to make that clearer.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. A separate question; I know that, obviously, you guys are not giving 2020 guidance here, but just in the context of your net debt EBITDA targets, certainly on the 2019 numbers, you're hitting those targets as the way you've laid out to us, but if this backwardation in the forward curve continues even with the margin enhancement improvement, I mean the sense is directionally 2020 EBITDA is slightly lower than 2019. So, does that figure into your calculations thinking about net debt to EBITDA if you were to use a 2020 denominator versus 2019, and how you might think about capital allocation in 2019 and maybe lay down more debt than you're currently showing us? Is that a fair way to think about this dynamic?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","I know the direction you're coming from. A couple of things of note, right. As I mentioned, you got $80 million of margin enhancement from 2019 to 2020. That's $135 million of margin enhancements in the 2019 number, going to $215 million in 2020, right? That's $240 million of debt capacity right there and I think we'll sort of take that as it comes going forward, but certainly, that provides a pretty significant cushion having achieved that in 2019 to get to that 3 times net debt to EBITDA ratio.","But I don't feel at all that we're going to need to allocate additional capital to maintain the 3 times. As Mauricio said, we will always continue to reevaluate the three as we move forward. So, my bias would believe \u2013 would be if there is any additional delevering, it would be by our choice as opposed to, for a lack of a better phrase, by necessity in terms of just maintaining the three times, if that makes sense.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That makes sense. Yes. Last question, Mauricio, as you look at all this excess capital that you are accumulating and as you said, the growth opportunities are fairly limited, Retail right now makes sense, but there isn't that much Retail; if we keep going down this road, and I'm not just talking 2019, but longer-term, is there a scenario where you just buy out and you know, just take the company private? I mean if you keep buying back stock with excess capital, where do we end then?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well \u2013 I mean I think our focus right now, like I said in the past, is to execute on our transformation plan and then as we laid out the long-term strategy of the company, it's very compelling. This is where we believe we can create maximum shareholder value. I will tell you, as you just mentioned, the excess capital that we have, and it's a \u2013 it's going to be \u2013 it's a priority for the board and for us, how to allocate this capital.","I've said it on the call and I will reiterate that again, from where our stock is valued today, it does not reflect the fundamental value and buying back our stock is still the most compelling opportunity. So, this is where we're focused and as we progress in 2019, if we see opportunities, if we see other alternatives, we always have to look at them through the prism and through the barometer of the implied returns that we have in our own stock.","So, we believe that we're on the right track, we have the right priorities, we're executing well, we have the right team and I'm just very pleased where the company is going.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Joelle. Well, I want to thank you all for your interest in NRG. Look forward to talking to you in the future.

Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date.","Actual results may differ materially. We urge everybody to review the Safe Harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law.","In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release and this presentation.","And now with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, everyone for joining our call today. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","We're off to a really good start for the year. Our financial performance was strong for the first quarter allowing us to reaffirm guidance for the full year. We're making significant progress in our priorities of reducing costs, replenishing capital, and deleveraging the business. And importantly, we're bringing certain people our platform with the conclusion of the GreenCo process.","So let me start with our first quarter results. NRG delivered $812 million of adjusted EBITDA under very challenging marketing conditions. We remained focused on our day-to-day operations, achieving top quartile safety performance, good availability across our generation fleet, and stable results from our retail business.","All of these, combined with our opportunity hedging program, mitigated the impact of the very weak wholesale prices that we experienced during the quarter. These results illustrate the strength of our platform and the unique value proposition that NRG offers.","We are making good progress in our commitment to deleveraging the business. We retired $229 million of NRG debt or approximately 30% of our 2016 targets. Not only are we on track with our original plans, we have expanded the total capital available for deleveraging to $1.3 billion after adding $253 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization financing, which Kirk will provide additional details on during his remarks.","Finally, this quarter, we're taking another important step forward in simplifying our business as we concluded, after much consideration, the GreenCo process. With the reintegration of business renewables last quarter and now the resolution for our Home Solar and EVgo businesses, which I will cover in more detail in a few slides, we have turned the page on this period of uncertainty and now are focused on executing our plan.","On our last call I spent some time talking about the merits of diversification as a necessary condition to succeed in the future of the competitive power industry. Today I want to expand on the multiple levers that NRG has to deliver value to our shareholders.","Now turning to slide 5, I have outlined the three key macro levers that describe the earnings potential of our business. Over the years we have successfully repositioned the company away from solely relying on energy margins to other more stable and predictable sources of revenue. So let me start with the first lever, which now represents two-thirds of our economic gross margin. This comes from parts of our business that are either not directly correlated to or that are countercyclical to the price of natural gas including our retail business, contracted generation and capacity payments.","This lever of our business provides a stable base of predictable and visible earnings potential, a quality that differentiates us from many others in our industry, and we do it at significant scale across all three areas. Keep in mind this base is also growing given market trends in renewables and contracted generation where our relationship with NRG Yield will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future.","Now let's talk about the second and third levers that comprise the other one-third of our economic gross margin which is directly tied to the price of gas and power. These portions' relative share has declined over the years given the prolonged weak commodity price environment. But we have deliberately maintained offset through fuel diversity, as I believe the current gas pricing environment is unsustainable in the medium to long run, and we want to be there with scale when the market recovers.","The second lever is what I refer to as the fuel spread. This is the traditional way we have made money selling coal, oil and uranium at gas prices. It is effectively a synthetic long gas position. For those of you who invest in the E&P sector, we are long roughly about three Bcf a day of gas, so for every $0.50 move in gas prices, our portfolio has the potential to flex up by $500 million in additional gross margin. Let me be clear. We're not gas agnostic and don't want to be gas agnostic, as we believe current prices are not sustainable.","The third lever is our power spread or heat rate exposure. As power markets tighten due to retirements or low growth, we maintain significant offset to increasing power prices, as we have the largest competitive power portfolio in the country with close to 50,000 megawatts of generation with both geographic and merit order diversification. So when people ask me why I'm convinced we have the right platform to be the leader in the competitive power space today and into the future, this is why.","Success in this industry is all about diversification of the business and core operational excellence. Our platform is designed to deliver results even in a difficult market, and given how unpredictable the markets can be having stability in our core platform is critical. At the same time, our leverage to any market recovery should be embraced not ignored because it is quite substantial. And when you couple these dynamics with our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and streamlining our costs, I have no doubt that NRG is built to thrive under a variety of market conditions.","So moving onto the next slide I want to touch briefly on key developments across our markets. We are encouraged by recent actions from regulators in support of competitive markets. We are pleased that FERC has stepped in to effectively stop the out-of-market PPAs for AEP and FirstEnergy in Ohio. It is also encouraging that the U.S. Supreme Court decided to invalidate Maryland contract created for the sole purpose of suppressing capacity prices.","In PJM, the transition to the capacity performance product has brought higher capacity payments in exchange for higher performance commitments as we have pivoted our suite accordingly. Our program of transforming coal plants to gas was undertaken with an eye towards becoming a provider of reliability.","In Texas, we're optimistic in ERCOT as we see up to 9 gigawatts of coal generation at risk due to upcoming environmental regulations and continued strong growth. In addition, we expect market changes to ORDC with the purpose of increasing prices to better reflect scarcity conditions.","And in the West, while the Aliso Canyon issue will present reliability challenges for the California ISO over the next year, we do not expect this issue to have significant impact to our generation portfolio since most of our revenue in California is supported by PPAs and RA contracts.","Also our newest merchant plant, Sunrise, is supplied off the Kern River pipeline and thereof not impacted. We hope this becomes a catalyst to address gas power for the nation and fuel cost recovery issues that are much needed in California.","Turning to slide 7, let me now discuss the details around the conclusion of the GreenCo process that we started in September of last year. Last quarter, I explained that there were three objectives we sought to accomplish in this process, maintain our capability to take advantage of renewable trends at appropriate investment returns, incorporate all of our businesses into our financial results, and to minimize the use of the $125 million revolver.","Today I'm here to tell you we have met our objectives and have concluded the process. To do a quick recap, beginning last quarter we reintegrated business renewables, which allows us to maintain a strong position in the renewables market. This business is now fully integrated, and I will be updating you on its progress in the months to come.","Moving to residential solar, we undertook a comprehensive strategic review process over the past six months to determine the best course of action to realize value, minimize capital needs and, like business renewables, ensure we do not lose the ability to meet renewable energy demands across all types of customers. While our original goal was to secure permanent capital and deconsolidate the enterprise, we were not able to move forward in this direction in a way that met all our objectives.","Today we're announcing a change in our approach to residential solar that will allow us to meet them. First, we're both streamlining and simplifying the organization by significantly lowering the cost structure and focusing in markets where we have a competitive advantage. Residential solar will become a product in our retail offering, and we intend to fully integrate into our retail business by 2017.","Second, we are changing our business model to focus on origination, installation, and direct third-party sales which will allow us to simplify financial reporting by providing immediate revenue recognition. I am pleased to announce new partnerships with both Sunrun and Spruce Financial which will allow us to execute on this plan.","Our approach comes with significant changes in our overall organization, cost structure, and business model. This model allows us to maintain our 2016 financial guidance as we transition the business throughout the remainder of 2016 to be at least an EBITDA breakeven business by 2017.","While this is not a business you can expect to hear about each quarter, our strategy for this business is important to our organization, allowing us to maintain a viable yet right-sized structure so that when the ERCOT market economics are viable we can offer residential solar to our existing 3 million customers.","We have also concluded the strategic review process for our electric vehicle charging network or EVgo. I am announcing today the sale of a majority stake of this business to Vision Ridge Partners. NRG will receive total consideration of approximately $50 million with $19.5 million upfront available to NRG and $30 million remaining in the EVgo platform. In addition, NRG have some earn-out potential of up to $70 million through 2022.","Under this structure NRG will have \u2013 will not have any ongoing capital commitments to EVgo other than its obligations under the California settlement. With the closing of this transaction, EVgo results will no longer be consolidated into NRG financial statements. With the conclusion of the GreenCo process, the $125 million revolver is no longer necessary and will be eliminated as we move forward and execute on our new plans.","On slide 8 I want to provide you an update on the great progress we have made in streamlining our cost structure. We are on track to realize $250 million in recurring cost savings in overhead and O&M, and we have made significant progress in our new FORNRG program targets. This means that over the next two years we will have taken an impressive $400 million in total costs out of the system. Additionally, you will be able to track these costs in our disclosures to see our progress as we move through the subsequent quarters.","While I am very pleased with our efforts to date, I expect that we will be able to find even more opportunities to reduce our cost structure as we continue with our remaining asset sales, the integration of the residential solar business, and our push to find even more opportunities to streamline the organization.","So with that, I will turn it to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the financial summary on slide 10, NRG delivered $812 million in adjusted EBITDA and $249 million in free cash flow before growth in the first quarter of 2016.","Having now concluded the GreenCo process, our financial results in our guidance now include both EVgo and the newly restructured residential solar within our corporate segment, which is part of the generation and renewable subset of our consolidated guidance. With all businesses now included, we are reaffirming our 2016 full-year guidance for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth.","During the quarter, we continued our deleveraging program and have now retired a total of $229 million of NRG corporate debt year-to-date through May 4, leading to an additional annualized cash interest savings of $16 million.","Finally, to update our progress in achieving our target of $1 billion in incremental consolidated available capital, which was announced on September 18th of last year, NRG has now completed a non-recourse monetization of future PJM capacity revenues from our Midwest Generation fleet for cash proceeds of $253 million. This transaction, which will be accounted for as a non-recourse debt financing with no impact on adjusted EBITDA, represents the final component of our plan to free up $1 billion of 2016 capital, leaving only the balance of our $500 million asset sale target. And we expect to complete this over the balance of this year.","Turning to slide 11, the Midwest Gen non-recourse capacity monetization proceeds of $253 million, increases our 2016 capital available for allocation by $210 million versus our prior expectation, as we reviewed during our year-end earnings call. The remaining $43 million in financing proceeds represents the acceleration of capacity revenues within 2016, which were already included in the NRG level of free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint, which was part of the $1.488 billion in 2016 capital available as shown in our year-end earnings materials.","Including the Midwest Gen proceeds, total 2016 capital available for allocation now stands at approximately $1.7 billion at the NRG level. We expect to allocate this incremental capital to further advance our deleveraging efforts or alternatively to repay our convertible preferred stock, which based on the conversion price relative to our current share price, presents a compelling potential opportunity.","The dropdown of NRG's remaining stake in CVSR to NRG Yield continues to represent an additional opportunity to further supplement NRG level capital available, and we intend to offer this remaining stake to NRG Yield during the quarter.","Finally, liquidity stands at $1.9 billion as of March 31, which includes $589 million of cash at the NRG level, which has since been supplemented with the proceeds from the Midwest Gen capacity monetization, which closed just following the quarter end.","Finally, turning briefly to slide 12, our continued progress on deleveraging keeps us on track to bring our 2016 corporate debt-to-corporate EBITDA ratio below our target as we position NRG's balance sheet to maintain adherence to our 4.25 times target ratio even through a continued low commodity price cycle. And we will continue to update this analysis as our debt reduction program progresses.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kirk. And in closing, I wanted to remind everyone of our priorities in slide 14. This is the scorecard that I will share with you throughout the rest of the year. As you can see we have made considerable progress in just the first few months of the year. Addressing the general debt is among one of our highest priorities given both the overall debt levels and maturities in 2017 and 2018. We're actively evaluating alternatives to optimize the capital structure with a focus on maximizing value for all stakeholders. With this objective in mind, we expect to be engaging in discussions with general creditors as a part of this process in the near term. As we evaluate alternatives, we remain committed to our prudent balance sheet management principles including maintaining our target corporate credit metrics.","We remain focused on executing our current strategy. And with the reintegration of renewables, we're now in a position to reinvigorate the development pipeline and provide certainty to NRG Yield's growth potential. I believe we now have all the pieces to move forward and demonstrate the value of our integrated platform.","So with that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Our first question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to just delve into the relationship with Sunrun and Spruce that you mentioned. Could you just walk through the roles of NRG and then your two partners just so I can understand better the nature of that relationship, what each party brings to the table, and what this business looks like for you going forward?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure Steve. I mean, I think the best way to think about it is we're going to be focused in the area that we believe we have a competitive advantage. That is in selling the system and installing the system. Once we do that, we have an agreement with Spruce and Sunrun to monetize these systems, to monetize these leases into their platform. So I mean it is a different way of \u2013 the way we have done it in the past. If you recall, we were \u2013 before we would drop it into Yield, but we would be \u2013 it would be consolidated NRG as a whole. Now basically the entire lease goes to our partners.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. So the assets won't go to NYLD, but \u2013 and your partners will monetize it. So would you receive effectively an upfront fee for the value you're creating by acquiring a customer or would there be an ongoing cash flow to you?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Steve, it's Kirk. The way to think about this is the cost of the system, which is normally in the traditional construct you think about the CapEx necessary to put a given system in place. The way to think about that in this construct is that is basically cost of goods sold. And the revenue is the price that Sunrun and Spruce pay us for that particular system.","So rather than you \u2013 than seeing proceeds come in in terms of a return of capital and CapEx go out in advance of that, that is now going to be revenue, which is what we will receive for lock, stock and barrel the entirety of system to Sunrun or Spruce. And then they'll also retain the ongoing obligation to manage and operate the system O&M and the like. And our \u2013 and what was formally our capital expenditures would be COGS. So think about it. We are migrating to a gross margin model rather than a gain on sale model, if you want to think about it that way.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Yeah. That's very clear. So Kirk, then every quarter as you get new customers and you sell those assets to Sunrun and Spruce and then that's revenue in terms of the proceeds you receive from them every quarter your operating costs, which used to be CapEx are truly COGS. That's clear. Okay.","And then I just wanted to shift over to, Mauricio, what you had said on GenOn at the end. I know we don't know \u2013 we can't predict what the outcome will be of those discussions, but is it a clear priority that if there were to be an outcome that that outcome needs effectively to be consistent with your overall credit metrics of NRG as a whole?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely, Stephen, and I've said that before. And I want to make sure that I'm clear. I mean, we have to maintain the credit metric targets that we have at NRG in \u2013 and adhere to that principle in any of the options that we are going to be evaluating. As I said, I would like to simplify the message in the spirit of that. We need to look at simplifying also the capital structure. We need to address GenOn for that reason and because of the near term maturities that we have, but we have to adhere to those prudent balance sheet management principles that we have.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you very much.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Can you guys hear me okay?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, just fine.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Greg","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. So just to beat a dead horse a little bit on the resolution of the process, it sounds like you've created a reasonable way of sort of keeping an option while stopping the losses. But there's probably a lot of investors who are hoping that there would be a clean break here. So can you just talk about the process and the market (25:31) crossover in those assets and why the option, which frankly I think sounds like a good option, is the best thing that you could come up with?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Greg, I mean, we actually went through a process that took a significant amount of time. During this time I think everybody knows that we knew that the conditions both in the capital markets and then through the beginning of the year were pretty challenging for both the residential solar business as a whole but also on the capital markets. So this was not the best time to be in the market. We knew that. That's why we were looking at selling a majority stake, not all of it, because we wanted to maintain the optionality on the Texas market where we think we have a significant asset in our customers to be able to offer them residential solar.","I think when you couple that with this change in the business model where it's effectively we sell, install and flip to a third party, and importantly, refocusing the business where we actually have been successful in the past and reducing significantly the cost structure. We felt that that combination was the best path for maximizing value for this business. And I think we'll provide that over the next 12 months. We expect that business to be at least breakeven in 2017.","I've always looked at residential solar as another product in our retail offering. It makes a whole lot of sense if we already have that relationship with the residential customer and this is one of the products that they are asking for it that we provide it. And if we can provide it in a way that is cost effective and that we can create value, we should have it in our lineup of product offerings.","So I think the rationale is there. I think the appetite from customers for rooftop solar is there. We just needed to make pretty significant changes in the way we can structure the business model to ensure that it was, quite candidly, a profitable one. And I think that those are the steps that we have taken.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So first of all, you're focusing on New Jersey, Massachusetts, New York. Those are states where you have a presence. So that means you're going to stop spending gobs of money on advertising and feet on the street to try to break into markets where you don't have a presence. Should I presume this also means that you're merging the business line into the core business and getting rid of duplicative overhead, marketing staff and other things like that and just making it sort of part of the product offering of the overall business as opposed to a separate freestanding business, and those are sort of the ways that you're reducing the cost profile?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Exactly. I mean not only we are reducing all the costs by not being in states or regions where we don't have a core advantage, but making it part now of our retail business or in the process of making it to our retail business, we will have significant synergies. Particularly in the marketing and selling, if we now have already a relationship with a customer that is buying system power, we will be using those same vehicles to offer now rooftop solar and potentially decrease the cost of selling that we had on a standalone basis.","So I mean, I think this way we create not only a lot of synergies by including in our retail business, but we also are being very disciplined in terms of the size and the scope of this business as we transition through this period, and importantly, maintain the option to, if this becomes viable in Texas, we can offer this to our 3 million customers because that to me is the prize. I mean, that is the goal.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. One more question and then I'll go to the back of the queue as well. You made the decision to bring some cash flow forward by monetizing these capacity payments. I mean, theoretically cash in hand today is better than cash in hand a year or two from now, especially if you're in a position to aggressively de-lever the balance sheet. But Kirk, can you talk about what you're foregoing in the future to get that cash today? How much financing costs are you incurring? And do you see that as working given the market opportunities to retire debt? And where is your debt currently trading? Is it still at big discounts or has it accrued?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I'll try to cover all that, but if I miss a piece of your multi-part question you can remind me. But as to the Midwest Gen financing, to answer your question, is it worth it? Yes. As I think as we disclosed in the press release, certainly in the Q, a cost of just under 4.5%, and that is basically the way to think about the cost of financing.","The way that it works mechanically is you're basically monetizing today the discount and the implied cost from an interest rate standpoint is that kind of 4.5 type cost. Relative to the opportunities certainly that we have and even relative to what the path that we were on exploring previously, which is the term loan B market, we see that as at an attractive cost, as you well put it, to bring cash forward today to take advantage of opportunities and obviously get ahead in our deleveraging progress.","I mean, certainly we are focused on doing that, but we are cognizant of the fact that right-sizing the balance sheet is important today so that we can preserve flexibility for the company tomorrow. And this $250 million, net $210 million as I mentioned for 2016, is an important step in that direction for us.","As far as our overall debt is concerned, our long-term notes are still trading at a much smaller discount. They've accreted largely closer to par even on the long-dated maturities, which certainly from the standpoint of opportunistically purchasing debt at a discount makes it more expensive, but as you well know, we are a serial issuer or a serial roller of debt from a refinancing opportunity standpoint. So that certainly I feel a lot more comfortable with what that means.","In terms of the barometer and the confidence that the high yield market has and the quality of our credit, I think underpinned by what we're on the path to doing in driving those ratios down, and also giving us greater flexibility on the refinancing front. So in the total package, I like where we are today. I mean, I think we've probably have seen 350 basis points of rally on the long side just since our last earnings call.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, guys. I'll go to the back if I have more.","Kevin L. Cole - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. I actually have a question about your sensitivity to gas and heat rates. I think we've all struggled with trying to gauge what is the correlation between the heat rates and gas especially in Texas? And also how linear is this correlation with gas is especially for the GenOn portfolio, right? You're showing a movement of $0.50 in gas, and I'm basically trying to understand how you are showing that sensitivity because a $0.50 move in gas presumably has little effect at all on GenOn's assets.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Angie, I'm assuming that you're talking about the slide 5 where I put the sensitivities...","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...for the entire portfolio?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just \u2013 I mean, this is the entire portfolio, not just coal and nuclear, which have been our traditional disclosures. But I guess in the spirit of providing more visibility and clarity to the sensitivity on commodities, I included the gas and oil portfolio as well in this sensitivity chart.","So the way to think about my remarks of moving the value of the portfolio by $0.50, $0.5 billion is on an open basis. And this is based on economic generation that we can see today at current markets. So as you can appreciate that economic generation, as commodity prices move, that will increase and your sensitivity to the same $0.50 move will be greater. This sensitivity basically reflects the economic generation that is exposed at current market. So I don't know if that at least provides some clarity in terms of what this number is.","Now, in terms of the GenOn, I would say that it's pretty sensitive to increases in natural gas. I'm not sure I...","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Well, I understand, but I'm just trying to say a $0.50 increase in natural gas for GenOn doesn't necessarily mean that a number of those plants are now becoming economic, right? And yet a $1 increase in gas would make a number of GenOn assets economic. So I'm basically trying to see how to capture that sensitivity, right, which is clearly accelerating as gas prices rise.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. No. That's fair. The only thing that I would say is, as you recall in particular on the GenOn complex, but this is in general to both portfolios for GenOn and EME, we already went through a pretty comprehensive asset optimization process where we converted some of these coal plants that were very sensitive to energy prices to natural gas, in effect pivoting the revenue driver from energy margins to capacity margins.","So I would say that some of that is already captured in the GenOn complex. I don't know if that was part of your comment that, perhaps, the GenOn complex is not as sensitized to natural gas because of those fuel conversions, but $0.50 makes some difference. I mean, it is not \u2013 you will be, I guess, adding economic generation as prices increase. But from current levels where we are, clearly, it's not as significant as it would be in a different market scenario.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And how about now the link between gas prices and heat rates? I'm particularly struggling how to call it in Texas. So you're showing the movement in gas by $0.50 and one heat rate. Can you tell us what's the correlation between these two in Texas and PJM or across the portfolio?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, I mean, I think for simplicity we have provided this as a linear sensitivity. So $0.50 move on gas, half a heat rate move on power, I mean, clearly, when gas prices increase, heat rates tend to be compressed because you want to keep (37:20) content. And the reverse happens when gas prices decrease.","We have not provided that comprehensive correlation just \u2013 I guess, just for simplicity. Not that we don't have it, because that's the way we actually model our portfolio when we account internally for different changes in commodity prices. But for these type of disclosures we are trying to make it linear and something simple that people can just have a rule of thumb.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Mauricio, a couple clarifications. On the EME money forwarding, are you going to have to put money back into Edison Mission, Midwest Gen in 2018, 2019?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I am sorry, Steve. Are you saying environment \u2013 some sort of environmental CapEx or asset optimization? What...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","No. I'm sorry. The forwarding of the hedge value, the capacity value, excuse me.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not necessarily putting money in, but as I said before, it is literally a shift forward. So one of the points I wanted to make clear is because of the accounting convention behind how this particular capacity monetization is treated, it is treated as a financing which is why the EBITDA or capacity revenue component of our revenue line is unchanged. But the overall cash flow effect is we're getting those proceeds today. We'll have the capacity revenues tomorrow, but we will have an offset or principal and interest payments that is associated with the payments, if you will, to be third party.","But there isn't an injection of cash per se. It's just that the capacity revenues serve to pay the financing cost principal and interest, at least directionally, or the way that is going to play out in the financials as we go forward, if that makes sense.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. But just then from a cash flow standpoint in 2018, 2019 I assume you lose that cash at...","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","...EME.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The direct answer is yes. You're pulling the cash forward today which means it won't be there tomorrow.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Okay. And then just on the thinking on GenOn, so the support payments which I think are part of your NRG EBITDA, in the event that we go to the scenario where you do have to kind it let it go, can you cut cost significantly to kind of offset the loss to that revenue?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Steve. I mean, I think the rule of thumb is that it's about 50% of the cost that we...","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is a significant portion of that number overall. I mean, as you recall, you go back and look at our overall corporate G&A before GenOn and after GenOn, the costs associated with managing that overall portfolio and providing those services is a significant portion of that shared services payment as we move forward. So there is an offsetting reduction in cost if you, just for academic purposes, imagine that shared service payment away. It isn't an absolute.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. So Mauricio, you made the point on natural gas prices and the fact that you're long natural gas, which makes sense. Just wanted to understand how you look at retail when you talk about it because you mentioned retailer is countercyclical, which we all understand it is. So when you look at EBITDA sensitivities to natural gas prices, how do you fit in retail and the sensitivity of retail being countercyclical to that EBITDA sensitivity?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. I mean, we have said in the past that in a rising natural gas price environment which theoretically will also increase in power prices, our retail business will contract in their margin. But that will be more than offset on the pickup that we will get on the generation side.","So when we think about that integrated platform, we have actually smoothed some of the peaks and valleys by putting it together, particularly in Texas, which is important because of the market construct. The energy-only type of market construct that is the way I described it is feast or famine. I mean, it is almost a digital market. It is prices are very low or prices are very high.","So we feel very comfortable with our value proposition. And we feel very comfortable that if gas prices rise the impact or the negative impact that has in retail is more than offset by a significant multiple on the generation side.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. That's simple. But any order of magnitude impact on the retail versus the wholesale?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think we \u2013 I mean, we've provided a band of our retail business in the past, but I don't believe we have provided a sensitivity to a percentage move in natural gas or power prices. But I mean that is something that we could potentially look at in the future. And I'm making a note of that.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. That would be very helpful. And just quickly, secondly, I was looking at your hedge disclosure on slide 24.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And the Texas and South Central seems to have a weighted average hedge price that looked to have dropped for 2017 by about $5 a megawatt hour, and just wanted to ensure I understand what's driving that?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Look, I mean, what we did is we layered in additional hedges for 2017. I mean, if you look at the hedge percentages from the last quarter to this quarter, I think we increased by I want to say 25% to 30% our total hedge price. And I think that is the effect of just increasing our percentage hedge at some lower prices which reflect current market. And I mean we did it in the back of the recent rally that we have seen in the natural gas market.","As I have said, I continue to be bullish in 2017, but we need to be prudent in terms of our hedge profile for a potential extension of this trough in the commodity cycle. But as we have been in the past we're very opportunistic, and we felt that with this recent move it was a good time to layer in additional hedges. Now, I think that pertains only to our coal and nuclear fleet. It does not have our gas portfolio reflected in this.","Chris, do you have any additional comments?","Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations","No. I think that's true. I think that's a factor of some of the heat rate moves we've seen on the expansion and how you calculate gas sales when you translate them into heat rate. Sometimes you get a bit of a funny move like that. As you can see the average equivalent natural gas price is decent right there at $3.52, so I think it's an artifact of some moving around on the heat rate side.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you, guys. I will get back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys, two questions for you and congrats on a good start to the year.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just looking at some of the detail you provide on the Texas market in your market outlook, I'm kind of at slide 21 and beyond. Just curious, the units you view at risk, what do you think the catalyst is? What you think the timeframe is for when the owners of some of those units have to start making decisions about when to retire? Is there a forcing function or could this kind of drag out longer than people expect?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, I mean, I will give you two cents on it before I pass it on to Chris, but clearly the current commodity or power price environment is already a pretty good catalyst for starting that conversation. And we announced at the beginning of this year that we were going to \u2013 our intentions to retire one of our units because of the absolute lack of scarcity pricing and the failure of ORDC to provide the right price signal in what we consider the tightest market in the country.","So I would say that you have different catalysts right now brewing. The first one is this very low power price environment in Texas. The second one is the regional case regulations and then the one-hour SO2 requirements. So when you put those three together, I think this is what we tried to show in this slide, which units are exposed to either one, two or all three. And I think that will inform the decision of asset owners in terms of the economic viability of their units.","But Chris, I mean, do you have...","Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations","Well, yeah. I don't know that I have a lot to add to that. I mean, I think as you're sitting there and you're thinking, God, I have to put new scrubbers on Big Brown and Monticello. And then, oh, we still haven't seen exactly what the damage is from those in terms of we haven't yet seen the final one-hour SO2 impact. I think that combination has got to be daunting.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What's the timeline? When do plants have to comply with both those?","Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations","Well, regional haze is going to be later 2019, 2020 and the one-hour SO2 I don't have a good answer for you on because I think it's still being baked.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And when you think about nuclear plants in Texas, I mean, we're seeing retirements of nuclear plants in some of the markets that have capacity payments. Can you talk about whether South Texas project is generating free cash flow and whether you think nuclear plants are facing some of the same challenges in Texas that we're seeing elsewhere in the country?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Michael. I mean, I think all the traditional baseload generation is facing some challenges at $2 gas prices. I think from our perspective, and we don't provide specific information on a plant by plant basis, but what I will tell you is in Texas we actually have a higher threshold than if we were a standalone generator. And the reason why is of our integrated model. So we actually achieve significant amount of synergies and value by pointing generation to retail. We avoid collateral charges. We avoid friction costs. So we have this higher threshold when it comes to evaluating the economic viability of the plant.","But again, I don't think we can make a decision of retiring a plant based on one month or three months of very low commodity prices which, to be fair, we have very effectively mitigated with our hedging philosophy and strategy. What we need to do is we need to look at it in the context of all the dynamics in that market. What are the prospects for each of those plants, and what exactly is what that plant provides to the system that eventually will be captured in the prices? So that's I guess where I see that.","What I will tell you is that we have an absolute commitment to operate plants that are economic. We have, I think, a pretty good track record in terms of retiring plants where the system doesn't need them in the past, for over the last 10 years. And even since the beginning of this year we have retired close to a gigawatt of generation in western New York and Texas because the market just doesn't support it and because we felt that the economic prospects in those particular markets were not going to support it. But I think investors should rest assured that we will make the right economic decision. But we need to make sure that we go beyond the next month and we look at the prospects going forward.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, Mauricio, much appreciated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So a couple of little questions, little details here on the resi solar piece, just going back to that, how many megawatts do you expect you will be able to monetize annually as far as a run rate? And then secondly on the EVgo piece can you comment real quickly, what's the California payout still due? I imagined \u2013 I think it says you retain that piece?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Julien, it's Kirk. I'll answer the EVgo piece of that. We've probably got over the next four years about \u2013 the good rule of thumb on the California settlement, think about that order of magnitude about $20 million a year over the next four years. It bumps around, but that's sort of a good averaging. And then we'd be completed in terms of our obligations in California under that settlement.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Julien, I mean, I think what you should be looking at on the home solar business is we're actually looking at the last six months of operation. We don't have any grand aspirations in terms of the total sales and installations that we want to have for the year. We're calibrating that to the historical levels.","I feel very strongly that our plan needed to be a plan that it was achievable. I'm not going to provide you specific numbers, but what I will tell you is that I feel very comfortable hitting those targets. And I think with the agreements that we have with our partners we're going to be able to effectively implement this new business model. So I think that's what I'm comfortable disclosing to you, Julien, today.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Well, wait, sorry. Just to be clear you're comfortable hitting which target?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. What I'm comfortable is on the financial numbers that I provided. I don't want to go into specific systems that we're going to be deploying. What I said is that this business is going to be at least break even by 2017, and that in 2016 the negative EBITDA that I have disclosed is mostly coming from this first six months of operation while we were running this business. I mean, going forward I think that turns into a breakeven value proposition. But I don't want to provide right now specifics in terms of megawatts deployed or systems installed. I feel that the financial disclosures that we're providing will be sufficient going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just turning to the PJM auction coming up here, I've just got to ask. You put it 140 to 160 as analyst expectations, but what are your expectations? And then specifically within that what are you thinking about demand response, the RICE regulations, and new supply entry?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Chris, any comments on the BRA?","Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations","Yeah. I mean, back on page 22 we discussed it a little bit. I mean, we've seen some pretty decent numbers out of capacity markets in general across the board there at $7 NE Pool (54:43). We like \u2013 obviously the last BRA in the 200s for areas where we have a lot of generation were fantastic results. And then the New York May spot market has been \u2013 was a great trend there in the face of a lowered load forecast.","We see a lower load forecast for the CP auction as well. So it's probably down year-on-year. So that's why we threw the analyst expectations on. I'm not going to throw a number, our own internal number out there, but look, I think it's reasonable to think it's going to be down some or moderate a little bit from the numbers we saw last time just because of the changes in load forecast.","And then you're right to point out, I think there are some pretty big wildcards out there in terms of, hey, what does FirstEnergy do? What does AEP do? And what kind of impact is the RICE NESHAP going to have on those? And those are a bit of wildcards out there that could swing that one. Well, I think that those swing it directionally upwards compared to where it otherwise would be if you start pulling out some of the DR based on auto DR. And then also if you look at FirstEnergy and AEP decide they're going to retire those units and don't want capacity obligations because they're concerned about whether or not this end run, this most recent end run they're trying around FERC works or not.","I think there that 6,000 megawatts of stuff that's up in the air, which arguably could have a bullish piece on it. Will that be enough to offset the load change that they've had in the load forecast? That remains to be seen.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","But I don't hear you emphasizing new supply or a big swing in demand response, right?","Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations","Sorry, Julien, say it again?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","I don't hear you emphasizing a big move in new supply or demand response participation.","Chris Moser - Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations","Well, I think on the demand response side this is kind of the last hurrah for a base \u2013 for the base capacity product. So we'll see what happens on that side, but I \u2013 yeah. I don't think there's big swings either way on those two points.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Mauricio, you mentioned at one point that you are going to start looking for incremental savings. And just when we benchmark your SG&A against some of your peers, obviously, you are a bigger company, but it does seem still to be a much more scaled number than maybe others have. Can you give us some insight into what you see as the factors there and what sort of areas you might be looking at as you try to drive further cost savings? Is it a presentational issue?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right, Jonathan. No. I mean, what I said in the past is that I think it's not a fair comparison to put us against some of our generator peers because they don't have the scale of our retail platform and our retail business. So I mean, I think on our generation platform, I will put it vis-\u00e0-vis anybody in our space, but you need to take into consideration that we have a retail platform that I don't believe anybody else on our sector has. What we have done today and what I tried to articulate today is really to give you a comprehensive look at the entire cost structure that we have, one that you can actually reconcile with our financials and that you can hold us accountable going forward.","We have identified and either executed or are in execution close to $400 million of cost reductions that I feel we all feel very comfortable that are very achievable. And we're making significant progress. I think there are more opportunities as we integrate some of the businesses, specifically residential solar into the platform, but I expect that we will be looking at other areas. We now have a comprehensive continuous improvement program that over the years have been very effective under FORNRG umbrella, and we are extending that, expanding that to the entire organization.","So we are reinvigorating that initiative. It is now company-wide, and I expect that we will come with additional savings under that framework going forward, and as we start identifying them I will provide that additional detail. But I'm just excited about where we are in terms of our cost reduction program. We have made significant progress and I think we run a very \u2013 we're going to be running a very efficient organization here. That is my goal, and again, I mean I think when it comes to comparisons you need to make sure that you compare apples to apples.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No. That is fair, but do you think that this sort of next round you're alluding to is something in 2016 or is that more longer term?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think it would be in 2016. I mean, we are in the process right now. I mean, I announced today the reintegration of residential solar. We have identified, as I said, significant cost savings. I think as it fully integrates with retail I am sure that there will be more. And we're looking across other areas in the organization. So I mean this is an area of focus and to be candid, I mean, it is a reflection and it has to be an \u2013 it is an imperative in this commodity cycle. So we are looking across not just overhead but also operations, O&M, and that is an area of focus as we're seeing changes in dispatch profiles and changes in terms of how our units get compensated specifically moving from energy-driven margins to capacity-driven margins. So I mean, everything is on the table. And I think, as I said, I mean, it is an imperative in this current commodity market environment.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And maybe I'd just make one quick one on if you do move into Texas with the home solar business, is it agreed that that will be with the same partners under the same model or is that TBD?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's a TBD. Right now the partners were focused in the three Northeast markets. And I can't comment right now in Texas, but I think it's a TBD.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So the deal you have with Sunrun and Spruce is specific to the three markets we've talked about today then?","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think what I will say is that's where we're focusing right now, and our partners will support us on those three markets.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. All right. Well, thank you guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Brian Chin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks and good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Brian.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just going back to the Midwest Gen capacity, I get that you're just swapping out for a lower cost of capital, but what I'm wondering is that $253 million, does that cover the entirety of the Midwest Gen capacity? Is there an ability to upsize that to a larger number Why or why wouldn't you potentially upsize that lower cost of capital financing?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Brian, it's Kirk. What I would tell you is, no, it doesn't include all of it. The order of magnitude is a little less than half. There may be an incremental opportunity to do so, but that number provides us the amount of capital we thought was prudent right now given the opportunities we see on the deleveraging front. But again, so it's a little less than half of the total amount of capacity, so think about maybe 1,500 megawatts a year through the 2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019 timeframe.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then could you conceivably expand that for any of your assets in PJM East or potentially in California under resource adequacy constructs?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I can't really comment too much on California. I think that's a little bit more complex, but the answer on the PJM East front is yes. Added complexity there is \u2013 obviously, a lot of those assets are in the GenOn complex, but it's certainly not impossible where that's concerned. And then I think going back to Midwest Gen, certainly that's an opportunity that we'd revisit post the completion of the next round of auctions there in PJM.","Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate it. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Kirkland B.

Crane","Thank you, Chad, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined here today by Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer; and Kirk Andrews, the company's Chief Financial Officer. They will both be giving part of this presentation and be available for questions thereafter. Also joining us, some other NRG executives who will be available to answer your questions: Anne Cleary, the company's Chief Integration Officer; Chris Moser, who runs the company's Commercial Operations, including our Trading; and Elizabeth Killinger, who runs Retail for us in Texas; and Jim Steffes, who runs Retail for us in the Northeast United States.","So let me begin by recognizing that certain dichotomies exist between what we typically focus on during this earnings call and what we, NRG management, concentrate on while conducting the company's day-to-day business. Chief of these dichotomies is the one that exists around personal safety. While safety is not the focus of the financial community, it's very much our focus. Indeed, for NRG management, it is our primary focus. As such, I'm pleased to report today that in 2012, NRG achieved the best safety performance record in its history, a 0.52 OSHA recordable rate with not a single life-altering injury. This performance places us well within the top decile of our industry and is a testament to the hard work and professionalism of NRG's now 8,000 employees.","To put this achievement into a historical context, in 2004, my first full year here at NRG, our OSHA recordable rate was 4.48, which was itself significantly down from a rate of 6.05, which was what the company achieved in 2003, the year before I came here. So having brought the rate down over 90% in 2003 to 0.52 in 2012 is extremely noteworthy. So I want to start by using this public forum to congratulate the men and women of NRG on an absolutely stellar safety performance in 2012.","Now as we turn to 2012 financial performance, I am very pleased with our overall performance in a year when our fundamental commodities were under nearly constant bearish pressure, nor did the weather give us much upside, even in terms of the Northeast winter or the Texas summer. Not notwithstanding the moderate weather that we experienced in 2012, for NRG, financially, the formula remained the same in 2012.","Solid EBITDA with a healthy contribution from retail and a growing contribution from solar, plus robust free cash flow before growth. We also made significant strides in 2012 across our three-part strategic platform of enhance generation, expand retail and go green. I'll hit the highlights in each of these 3 areas on subsequent slides.","But first, I want to focus for a moment on an achievement, which has received relatively little public comment today, and that is the actions taken around our Louisiana portfolio in 2012. A decade-long extension to a couple of critical co-op contracts; a constructive settlement with the EPA of long-standing NSR litigation relating to Big Cajun II; and the reassessment of the company's overall environmental spend in light of currently applicable environmental and economic factors, which has enabled us to reduce our public estimate of our future overall spend as a company on environmental CapEx by over $100 million. This favorable outcome was a result of the coordinated efforts spearheaded by our Louisiana management team under the leadership of our Gulf regional organization.","Now turning to Slide 4, there are 2 points here. The first point is that we, in NRG management, have long objected to the view that our stock is just a proxy for long-term natural gas prices. Clearly in the past, now and into the foreseeable future, NRG will do better in a higher natural gas price environment than in a low natural gas price environment. But our goal as a management team has been to create a business model that allows NRG not only to survive, but also to flourish no matter what the price of natural gas might be from time to time. We have made significant strides in that regard, and it seems that the separation of our stock price performance from natural gas prices in the second half of 2012 might suggest that the market is coming to believe it as well.","My second point on this slide, which is obvious from the chart on Slide 4, is that 2012 was not an evenly paced year for the company. We clearly gained momentum during the second half of the year, and we are focused right now, hard on maintaining and accelerating that momentum in 2013 as we springboard off the forceful and expedited implementation of the GenOn integration.","In that regard, turning to Slide 5, under Ann Cleary's leadership, our integration effort has jumped off to a great start. Just 8 weeks into the integration, our confidence level on what we can achieve could not be higher. And as a result, we are pleased to announce an increase in our overall cost synergy target arising out of this combination from $175 million to $185 million. 52% of our new revised target run rate for total cost synergies already has been captured, and that's $97 million a year. Plus, over 90% of our balance sheet synergies, representing an additional $93 million a year, already has been put in place. So we are well on our way to delivering what we've promised.","As to what we have not yet promised, we have not yet revised our estimate of the operational synergies that we expect to be able to achieve as a result of operating the generating assets of classic NRG and the former GenOn plants as one combined fleet. I want to assure you that such work is ongoing at a very granular level across all the plants now in our system. As soon as we have firmed up the commercial and technological viability of our asset management plan around the entire set of generation assets, we will inform you of what we think we can achieve in regards to increased operational synergies, the cost to achieve these synergies and how long it will take us to achieve them. At this point, it is still too early for me to be specific, but I continue to believe that the $25 million a year estimate is quite conservative.","Now turning to Slide 6. While we obviously are focused as a company on the GenOn integration at the corporate level and on the wholesale side of the business, there are significant movement underway within NRG's retail companies to make sure we continue to grow our retail businesses in a way that enhances shareholder value, which means to us, profitable and intelligent growth with the key wholesale supplier risk inherent in the retail business covered or partially covered by our own wholesale supply.","To do this, we have reorganized our multi-brand strategy, principally on geographic lines, with Elizabeth Killinger of Reliant assuming all responsibility for NRG Retail in Texas; and Jim Steffes at the Green Mountain, assuming responsibility for all NRG retail in the Northeast United States. For each of our retail leaders, one of their many key objectives for 2013 will be to more closely integrate new clean energy products and services of the type -- briefly described near the bottom of Slide 6, into their conventional grid-based retail business. We already have a head start in this regard with what Reliant already has accomplished with smart energy products and services for the home, and we believe an assertive expansion of these clean energy products and services aimed at the end-use energy consumer and the seamless integration of them into a conventional retail offering of system power will have multiple benefits. It will differentiate our retail value proposition, promote customer retention and act as its own distinct and attractive sales channel. I think we will be able to report on very positive developments in the retail space by the end of 2013.","Now turning to Slide 7. The other major area of management focus, which you should be tracking, is our company's very substantial construction program. For the last couple of years, we have carried forward a multibillion-dollar construction program. From your perspective to date, there has been little to show for in terms of current EBITDA contribution. In 2013 and 2014, our construction program bears fruit in a significant way. In 2013, we expect over 2,000 megawatts of utility scale conventional and solar generation to come online. These projects should generate over $500 million in incremental EBITDA, almost all of which is fully contracted. So far, all of these projects are performing fully or close to fully in line with our expectations with respect to both time and schedule. You will be hearing more from us as meaningful milestones are achieved in our construction program in the months to come.","Beyond these projects, we continue to make substantial investment in a robust development program aimed at both revitalizing our conventional fleet in key locations and continuing the attractive growth of our industry-leading solar portfolio. With respect to the latter, we have over 900 megawatts of mid- to late-stage Tier 2 utility scale solar projects in development in key markets across the United States, 72 megawatts of which are already under contract. We also see and are pursuing significantly sized solar development programs at the sub-utility scale level in industry, commercial and arising out of government procurement.","Now turning to Slide 8 and to capital allocation, which is the fourth part of NRG strategy for value-enhancing growth. As mentioned previously, the company stands to be substantially free cash flow positive both in 2013 and 2014, notwithstanding the continued weakness of the underlying gas price fundamentals, and that free cash flow generation will add to the cash already on NRG's balance sheet, which we already have acknowledged as liquidity in excess of current need. Without undermining our eternal and unyielding commitment to prudent balance sheet management, or PBSM, as it's referred to in the upper part of this slide, we are now in a position to consider our options with respect to the optimization of your capital without the artificial constraints imposed in previous years upon us by various restricted payment baskets.","You will note, and Kirk will elaborate further, that as a first salvo in this regard, we have chosen to do 2 things: An increase in our annual dividend on common stock back to a level, which approximates 2% per year, the average dividend yield of the S&P 500; plus a buyback of $200 million worth of common stock. Together, these 2 actions represent a return to shareholders of close to 5% of our market capitalization.","What we hope we have accomplished with these 2 actions is first, having initiated the common dividend just last year. This year, we are acknowledging the principle that the dividend should grow over time. And second, with the share buyback, that we will not sit indefinitely on all of our excess capital. We see a lot of opportunities across our wholesale to retail business footprint within our industry and with our industry in a considerable state of flux with our own internal development opportunities and with the clean energy industry still struggling to figure out where it fits with the conventional business. We are highly confident we can deploy the company's capital in a way that generates cash, outearns our own cost of capital and enhances the strength of our overall asset portfolio and business model going forward.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. NRG closed 2012 on a high note and delivered another year of strong performance across the board.","I want to take this opportunity to join David and recognize every one of our colleagues at NRG for making this year the safest in our 9-year history. It was also our best year from an environmental standpoint. These are outstanding accomplishments that makes us all proud and the foundation for our best-in-class operations.","Now back to the results for the quarter on Slide 10. Our integrated platform delivered on our goal despite the low commodity price environment. Retail grew customer count and margins, and our commercial group was very successful in managing the retail loads and maximizing the value of our generation portfolio in a year where many of our markets saw the lowest electricity prices in a decade.","As we work through the integration process, it is important to start by providing you with a post-transaction view in key areas of operations, hedging disclosures and environmental spend. To that effect, the environmental capital plan of the combined company will be $630 million through 2017. This includes the $100 million reduction primarily related to mass compliance at our Big Cajun II facility that we announced during our third quarter call.","The entire operations group is very focused on further optimizing our combined spend through our successful FORNRG program and executing on operational synergies. As you know, the program has delivered significant improvement in the past, and this year was no exception. You can expect to hear from us in this area in the weeks and months to come.","Finally, on the construction front, we commissioned 280 megawatts of utility scale solar generation in 2012 with Borrego and Alpine coming online at the beginning of this year. El Segundo and Marsh Landing made significant progress in 2012 and remain on track for commercial operations in 2013. During the year, we also kicked off the construction of our Parish Peaker project for operation later in the year.","Turning to our operational metrics on Slide 11 and starting with safety, we achieved the lowest recordable injury rate in NRG's history and for the 4th year out of the last 5, achieved top decile performance in our industry. During the fourth quarter, 97 out of 104 locations were without a single recordable injury. I mentioned this post-merger count to highlight that we have combined 2 strong safety cultures, and we expect a continuation of great results going forward. A continuous improvement culture that drives our safety performance translates to results in the larger organization.","For the fourth quarter, our generation was up 8% compared to last year, driven primarily by the West region, which tripled the amount of generation in the Northeast assets. For the year, generation was down 10% compared to 2011, driven almost entirely by Texas due to coal-to-gas switching in the early part of the year, based on availability and milder weather. Our coal availability was 85% for the year. As I've mentioned in the past, in this commodity price environment, we need to balance operating performance and margin of risk by proactively taking outages during uneconomic periods with little opportunity costs.","Our gas portfolio performed well with almost 8,000 starts and 98% starting reliability. On January 8, we have failure on 1 of our 2 main transformers at STP Unit 2, caused incorrectly a unit trip while impacting one of the lube oil pumps. We experienced blade damage due to the turbine closing down without lubrication. Repair work is in progress, and we expect to have the unit back online by early May. The problem was isolated to the power side of the plant, and there was never a nuclear safety issue nor was anyone hurt during the incident.","Our FORNRG program had a very successful start with $36 million above our target for the year. A combination of recurring and nonrecurring items on asset optimization, property tax relief, retail synergies and outage optimization work helped us achieve this result. This program creates the right framework to achieve our operational synergies and one that will leverage best practices across a portfolio of now 100 plants and 330 fossil units.","Moving on to Slide 12. Our retail business has finished the year strong, delivering $656 million of EBITDA, slightly ahead of expectations, driven primarily by an increasing customer count, higher volumes and sustainable retail margins. In 2012, NRG grew customer count organically by 142,000 customers with 2\/3 of them coming outside of Texas, a compelling 7% growth rate overall. These results were driven by our effective sales and service execution, as well as the introduction of additional innovative promotions, products, channels and partnerships. Our investment in geographic growth to enter and further penetrate the Northeast markets was also effective, where we grew customer count by 43% year-over-year.","2012 was another year winning best competition in the C&I markets, and we remain committed to diligently manage the business, making trade-off to ensure profitable growth. Recognizing that Texas and Northeast markets are unique and consumers have distinct preferences for brand, channel and product combination, we refocused our business regional in the fourth quarter. This will enable our multi-brand business to launch relevant promotions, sales and products for each market, while leveraging our customer operations, scale, efficiencies and bad debt effectiveness across all our bands and markets.","Finally, the result for the quarter of the year is that we once again balanced customer count and margin consistent with our long-term strategy, and this strong performance has enabled NRG to remain the largest retail business in Texas with a healthy growing presence in the Northeast.","Moving on to Slide 13, I'd like to share a few comments in 2 of our core markets. Starting with our -- at the most immediate opportunity, we continue to see reserve margins below the target level despite downward revisions in local estimates by ERCOT in their latest report. Spark spreads have improved recently and are now indicated at the top end of the 6-month trading rates, but remain below new build economics by $4 to $5 per megawatt hour, as you can see on the upper left chart.","The ongoing debate around resource adequacy solutions and the recently announced changes of the commission will likely push any long-term position, probably summer. In the meantime, we continue to work closely with ERCOT and other stakeholders to improve the real-time price formation prior to this summer. Specifically, we are addressing real-time price mitigation and expansion of operating reserves, which if properly addressed, should help to provide the appropriate economic signals to the market.","In PJM, we see potential recovery in the medium term, with tightening coming from the supply side in the form of announced coal retirements for all clear megawatts, as shown in the upper right-hand chart, with a potential to lose another 2 to 4 gigawatts of average New Jersey head units. And you can see on the chart the combination of significant retirements across a heavy reliance on demand response to meet the reserve margin target, would indicate to us the need to -- the need for some premium in the market, which is noticeably absent as we look at the spark of spreads on the chart below. Based on new build economics, the potential OpEx could be close to $6 per megawatt hour, which our fleet will be well positioned to benefit from.","Turning to our hedging disclosure on Slide 14, we have fully hedged our 2013 expected coal and nuclear generation. In the medium to long term, we retain significant exposure so as markets improve, we stand to benefit from heat rate expansion and gas recovery. On the coal supply, we remain opportunistic to hedge the remaining overexposure in 2013 and, since our last call, we executed a coal transportation agreement for our Maryland units. I'm also pleased to report that the commercial integration so far have been relatively smooth, and we expect to finalize all changes to systems and personnel prior to this summer.","Finally, Slide 15 summarizes the goals and priorities for the operations group. We are focused first on completing the integration of the GenOn portfolio and executing on operations, commercial and construction objectives; second, on delivering the operational synergies that we committed across the fleet, both of which laid the foundation for our success in 2013 and beyond.","With that, I will turn things over to Kirk for the financial review","Kirkland B. Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 17, NRG is reporting fourth quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $420 million. For the full 12 months of 2012, adjusted EBITDA totaled over $1.9 billion, with nearly $1.2 billion from wholesale, $656 million from retail and $86 million from our solar projects.","Our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results include the impact of the GenOn transaction, which contributed approximately $10 million in adjusted EBITDA following the closing of the merger on December 15. Meanwhile, 2012 adjusted cash flow from operations was a robust $1.1 billion, driving free cash flow before growth of approximately $900 million for the year and leading to a $1.3 billion improvement in liquidity since year-end 2011.","Turning to capital allocation, I'm pleased to announce that we have now completed over 98% of the $1 billion debt reduction target announced in mid-2012 in connection with the GenOn transaction, significantly strengthening NRG's consolidated balance sheet. We achieved nearly $800 million in debt reduction by year-end 2012 through the combination of the 2017 refinancing and the repayment of the GenOn term loan. In 2013, NRG launched a debt open-market repurchase program, which has now been completed, resulting in the repurchase of $200 million in NRG unsecured notes of various maturities and representing the balance of our $1 billion deleveraging target.","In addition, having achieved our minimum delevering objective, we have now captured $93 million of the $100 million in annual free cash flow from balance sheet efficiencies announced in connection with the merger. Importantly, we now expect the $10 million increase in cost synergies, which will lead to at least $310 million in free cash flow benefits resulting from the GenOn transaction. The reduction in total debt, when combined with substantially increased adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in 2013 and beyond, now places us in line with target prudent balance sheet management metrics, providing NRG the flexibility to allocate its substantial excess capital towards both enhanced return to shareholders and the continued investment in NRG's future growth.","In the third quarter of 2012, NRG initiated its first-ever dividend, as our committed vehicle for annual return of capital to shareholders at a rate of $0.36 per share. This initial dividend was based primarily on the growing contracted cash flows from our successful renewable investment efforts. With the completion of our equity investments in our Tier 1 solar projects by the end of 2012, we see all of these projects reach COD by 2014 and deliver over $300 million in adjusted EBITDA.","Finally, in the third quarter of 2012, NRG announced a 20% reduction in expected environmental CapEx, further enhancing free cash flow and capital for allocation by a total of $100 million through 2017. In 2013, with our balance sheet now significantly strengthened, our credit metrics in line, previous RT constraints now lifted and a significant portion of our cash flow synergies captured, we are now pleased to announce a $200 million share buyback program, which when combined with an intended 33% increase in our annual dividend of $0.48 per share, represent a substantial increase in total capital we return to shareholders in 2013 versus 2012.","Turning briefly to the guidance overview on Slide 18, we are reaffirming the recently announced increase guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth for 2013 and 2014.","Turning to Slide 19. Beginning in 2013, NRG is changing the methodology used to calculate adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. We believe this new methodology, when combined with enhanced quarterly disclosure regarding NRG's proportionate share of debt and partially owned investments, will provide investors clarity to assist in evaluating NRG's enterprise value and leverage.","The changes to adjusted EBITDA include the following: first, we will now include a pro rata portion of the EBITDA of our equity investments in unconsolidated affiliates, instead of using a pro rata portion of net income; second, we will discontinue the deduction of noncontrolling interests, and we'll provide separately the proportionate amount of adjusted EBITDA and debt attributable to our partners in consolidated investments; third, given the significant increase in plant retirements resulting from the GenOn transaction, we will now exclude nonrecurring plant deactivation cost from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA; and finally, we will now exclude interest income from adjusted EBITDA and instead report it as a reduction of interest expense in the buildup of adjusted EBITDA in our Reg G disclosures.","In addition, we will begin adjusting free cash flow before growth investments for distributions to noncontrolling interests. This was previously deducted below this line to arrive at a change in cash or capital for allocation. However, as we do not currently anticipate making distributions to noncontrolling investors until 2015, our revised methodology does not affect our free cash flow before growth investments guidance under the new methodology. With a number of our projects partially owned, we believe this new EBITDA methodology-enhanced disclosure will permit us to provide our investors with a clearer picture of NRG's adjusted EBITDA.","Slide 20 provides you a breakdown of the impact of these changes in methodology on our 2013 and 2014 adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges. The total impact of these changes is approximately $80 million in 2013 and $60 million in 2014, resulting in a revised adjusted EBITDA ranges of $2.615 billion to $2.815 billion in 2013 and $2.760 billion to $2.960 billion in 2014. These changes impact the wholesale and solar guidance ranges only, with no impact in retail adjusted EBITDA guidance under the revised method. These revised adjusted EBITDA ranges are now more closely aligned with NRG's consolidated debt balances and will also provide investors the basis for understanding NRG's proportionate share of adjusted EBITDA and debt, which I will cover on Slide 21.","Turning to Slide 21 and focusing on 2014, the year in which our Tier 1 solar projects have all reached COD. At the top of this slide and starting with our adjusted EBITDA guidance under revised methodology, we have deducted our partner's share of EBITDA to arrive at NRG's proportionate share of adjusted EBITDA guidance. In the blue section of the slide, we have also provided adjustments to our projected consolidated debt balance for 2014, deducting our partner's share of debt and adding NRG share of debt associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates, to arrive at NRG's projected proportionate share of 2014 debt of $15 billion. This compares apples-to-apples to NRG's proportionate share of EBITDA of $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion for 2014.","Finally, in the yellow section of the slide, we have also provided separately NRG's proportionate share of both adjusted EBITDA and projected 2014 nonrecourse debt associated with our solar projects. Going forward, we will be providing our partner's share of adjusted EBITDA and debt as a part of the appendix to our quarterly presentations, as we believe this additional information will permit investors a clearer understanding of NRG's leverage, the leverage levels of our solar projects in particular and provide the basis for EBITDA multiple-based valuation of NRG.","Turning to corporate liquidity on Slide 22. NRG's current liquidity increased by $1.3 billion in 2012 to approximately $3.4 billion. This increase is primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $983 million due to the cash acquired in the GenOn transaction, which is net of cash used to retire the GenOn term loan; and an increase in the revolver availability of $385 million, primarily due to the reduction in letters of credit resulting from the sell-down of Agua Caliente. Our 2012 year-end cash would significantly exceed our targeted minimum balance of $900 million when, combined with our substantial free cash flow generation, formed the basis for capital available for allocation, which I will review in further detail shortly.","Turning to Slide 23. As a part of our 2013 capital allocation program, we intend to increase our annual dividend by 33% from $0.36 to $0.46 per common share beginning in the second quarter of 2013. The El Segundo project, when combined with the Marsh Landing project acquired in connection with the GenOn transaction, will both be online in 2013 and will begin contributing substantial cash distributions. These significant distributions, when combined with the cash flows from renewable assets, which form the basis for establishing our initial dividend, provide an expanded base of contracted cash flows to support NRG's increased dividend rate. By 2014, we expect total distributions from these long-term contracted projects to exceed the 2013 dividend rate by approximately $25 million and expect this excess to grow to nearly $75 million by 2015, providing the basis for potential continued dividend growth.","In a market environment with reliable yield hard to come by and many utility dividend payout rates now under pressure, we are pleased to now be in a position of providing enhanced current return to our investors based on the successful prior allocation of capital of these contracted investments. Moreover, NRG's increased dividend rate also represents only around 15% of our free cash flow before growth, providing a broader base of certainty, support and potential growth for this important vehicle for returning shareholder value.","And finally, turning to capital allocation on Slide 24, NRG ended 2012 with an excess cash balance of $1.062 billion, which consists of cash and cash equivalents less our targeted cash balance of $900 million and $125 million of cash at certain excluded project subsidiaries, which is not currently distributable to NRG.","subsidiaries, which is not currently distributable to NRG. This excess cash balance, when combined with NRG's 2013 free cash flow before growth investments, leads to $1.962 billion to $2.162 billion in cash available for allocation in 2013, representing more than a 60% increase over 2012. Approximately $900 million of 2013 cash available for allocation has already been allocated through a combination of previously committed growth investments, scheduled debt amortization in 2013, the capital deployed since year end to complete the open-market purchase of NRG unsecured notes, integration costs associated with the GenOn transaction and finally, a reserve for NRG's intended increased dividend.","We have now also allocated $200 million toward an authorized share repurchase program to be deployed during 2013, which when combined with the dividend increase, represents a significant increase in returning shareholder capital. After the capital allocation measures announced today are implemented, NRG's ongoing cash flow generation through 2013 will still provide nearly $1 billion in cash liquidity in excess of current commitments. We believe that type of financial flexibility as the year unfolds is a huge advantage in the dynamic marketplace and fluid capital markets in which we currently operate. However, consistent with our commitment to enhancing cash flow, exceeding our cost of capital and providing clear shareholder communication, we will continue to adhere to be disciplined in evaluating and executing any investment decisions.","With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks.","David W. Crane","Thanks, Kirk. As has been my tradition during my 9 years at NRG, on Slide 26, which is the last slide, we're ending our first earnings deck of the year with a checklist of key objectives for the year ahead. My goal in doing this is obviously so you can follow along and hold us accountable as we succeed or fail in our effort to lead the company you own forward.","Most of these specific goals were touched upon by Mauricio, Kirk or myself previously in this presentation, so I'm not going to elaborate further on any of these individual goals, unless you want me to. So I'll end by making only one point. I think the fundamental strength of NRG is that we are not wedded to generation alone or to retail alone or to any other single link in the energy value chain. We're not wedded to one technology, to one source of fuel or to one geographic location. We can go wherever in the industry we see the potential for profitable growth and shareholder value creation, and we have built a company now that has the ability to do just that. We look forward in 2013 to building on the momentum generated by a very successful 2012 for the benefit of all of you, the owners of NRG.","And with that, Patrick, we are happy to take a few questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I guess first off, David, CO2 legislations\/EPA regulation, just your general thoughts about where we are, say, versus 4 years ago and where we are today versus pre-election.","David W. Crane","Well, Brandon, how much time do you have? I mean from my perspective, a considerable amount of work has been done, particularly, I mean actually on the GenOn side of the equation in terms of back-end control. I mean it seems to me that where we're at quite frankly, on the coal side of the conventional power industry, is the plants that have put on the back-end controls I think have a medium- to long-term future. The ones that don't, at this point, it doesn't make a huge amount of economic sense to put more back-end controls on. With the idea the EPA regulating carbon by regulation, I mean, I assume that's the path we're on now. I mean I don't see -- I mean there's obviously been more talk about climate change and the like with the reelection of President Obama, but I don't see any sort of legislation passing through Congress. So it's up to the EPA. And I think they'll take action, but the nature of EPA action will be so slow-moving once it works its way through the whole process, that it's almost not really even in our short- to medium-term planning horizon. It's something really virtually for the next decade. So in that sense, I don't think there has been a fundamental change as opposed to the last results of the election cycle. I don't think there's any sort of talk in any circles about a rebirth of the Waxman-Markey-style legislation. So I think we're in a pretty good place. I mean the amount of money that we're talking about spending to finish out the back-end controls, I think that's really it, and we're going to be pretty well set. Did that answer your question at all? I mean, because I could go on, but I should stop there and let you ask. You're allowed what, one backup question or a second follow-up question, right, Chad?","Chad Plotkin","Absolutely.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, that's helpful and it may reenter the follow-up question, which is about growth. You guys have proven to be head and shoulders about the peers as far as being opportunistic around looking for newer or perhaps often senseless places for growth. Say over the next 3 years, a balance between returning cash to shareholders and new growth opportunities, where do you see that weighting, biased towards one direction or another over the next 3 years?","David W. Crane","Well, Brandon, the first way I'd answer that question is to punt and basically say it's the last 5 years that I've been in this industry, which is really actually like the 5 years before, that has proven one thing is that none of us have any idea what the next 5 years are going to be about. And I think what we've really done is built a company now with its natural resources that can go in either direction. I mean we actually do, I think maybe unlike some of the other companies in our sector, see a lot of opportunities across the space. And I would say right now, in terms of reinvesting in the business, I would say we've got a lot going on, on the generation side. But I guess what really animates me when I get up in the morning is what we can do on the retail space and around the customer and bringing together conventional retail and new clean energy and products, which will be appealing to the consumer. The thing though about those types of investments, Brandon, is they tend not to be as capital-intensive, and the bets are smaller. Hopefully, the payback is quicker or as they say, if you're going to fail at something, fail quickly and cheaply. And so as we move and try new things in that area, I think it will still leave a lot of capital for the return of capital to shareholders. I mean, obviously, we're excited about what we did today in terms of the increase of the dividend in particular. We'd like to do more of that in the future, but obviously, we're not committing ourselves to a particular rate of increase. And as Kirk talked about, it's going to be sort of tied to how much we get accomplished in terms of contracted investments. And I think that we will see more -- in this natural gas price environment, if there's going to be more built in the United States on the generation side, it's all going to be based on bilateral contract. We've got great sites, we've got the people, we've got the ability to repower, conventional and renewable. And so, hopefully, we can grow the dividend off the back of an ever-increasing amount of contracted revenue streams. So that's my long-winded answer. My short-winded answer is I think we can do both. We can continue to return capital to shareholders and really stakeholders in terms of debt paydown and reinvest across our portfolio of businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Cohen with ISI.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have 2 questions, one for David and one for Kirk. David, do you have any sense of when we're going to get an update on the O&M synergies in 2013? How long will it take you to do your review and what that would amount to?","David W. Crane","Well, what I would tell you is that we would, Jon, probably tell you more than I should, we would like to disclose the more -- the greater synergies about the time or on the next earnings call, but I can't commit to that 100% because we have a clear idea commercially of what we would like to do. But I mean we need to do sort of a technical review of some of our plants as to make sure the plants can back up what we want to do on the commercial end. And that involves things like boiler inspections and analysis, which are far beyond my intellectual capacity to understand. And if those take longer than the next earnings cycle, then we're going to take a little bit longer because when we do come out, we want to be 100% certain that we can accomplish what we tell you we're going to accomplish. But certainly, our goal is the next earnings call.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then -- and Kirk, what are the opportunities for further delevering aside from just open-market repurchases? So I know a lot of the debt, especially the GenOn debt, is trading at pretty high levels here. But what's the timeline on when various pieces of that become callable? And I guess the second question is, are you happy to hang on to some of that excess deployable cash until the call dates or is that kind of too far out?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Well, I'll take your questions -- the components of your questions in reverse order. No, I'm not happy to hang onto excess deployable cash for an undefined period of time for any purpose, but I feel comfortable that we've got sufficient cash flow generation and liquidity to be able to address the opportunities that may arise on the debt side of the equation. But in terms of the opportunities that I see currently, what hamstrings us, at least opportunistically, clearly, we were focused on and are pleased to have achieved the $1 billion deleveraging objective, which is what the last component of that open-market purchase program was all about, taking care of that last 200. Looking forward, given the fact that our balance sheet is in line with our targets and return to shrink, my view is in further delevering, it constitutes opportunistic delevering. And given the trading levels of our bonds, as you acknowledge the fact that, to answer your question, they aren't currently callable, our 2014 maturity at the GenOn level obviously comes due in relatively short order, but our remaining maturities are not callable until 2014. I think we've got a couple -- our 2019 -- our 2 tranches of the 2019 bonds are recallable in '14. But until that time, those call premiums are significantly lower than the current trading levels of our bonds, which in my view, don't represent a compelling level, both from a yield and total -- or both from a current return and total return perspective to warrant allocation of capital opportunistically. But we'll continue to look at alternatives around that. But for right now, I think we're satisfied with where we are.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one little knit on Slide 24, you have the green chunk in the pie chart as growth investments of $226 million. Should that not be net of projects financing? So in one of your later slides, I think you had $163 million of project financing. Should that be in addition to what's shown here?","Kirkland B. Andrews","No. The growth investments of $226 million, which is in the green section, that is equity investment that is net of project financing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","At a high level, what are all the options we have in terms of monetizing your solar assets? And how are you thinking about the timing there?","David W. Crane","Well, I'll answer the easier second part of the question and then drop it to Kirk to say what he wants to say about the first half of the question. Our timing is that since really we sold down part of Agua Caliente to MidAmerican, which is now over a year ago, we've been communicating with the investment community that we feel that the best time -- having demonstrated that we could sell down the assets, the solar assets, to add value, that the best time to actually do that to optimize that is around the time of commercial operation of the assets. And the bigger assets in particular are all achieving or coming very close to achieving commercial operation during 2013. So the -- to the timing -- the answer to the timing portion of your question is, our timetable is this year. As to what our options are, Kirk, how much do you want to say or not say in that direction?","Kirkland B. Andrews","I mean the only thing I'd add is clearly, as David said, we're focused on 2013, in part because these -- that's when these assets come online. And with all of them now at COD, we see the realm or universe of potential partners or investors or sell-down candidates as expanding. And the return expectations, given the fact that the perceived risk at least having achieved COD, is now lower. As far as alternatives, I think I'd only say certainly, transaction is not unlike what you saw with Agua Caliente. I certainly continue to see it as being a possibility, both at the individual asset level and though less likely, though still possible, at the sub-portfolio level. But beyond that, I wouldn't elaborate. I think those are probably the 2 most likely categories, but we're continuing to evaluate those. And like you say, I think as we get closer to COD, we're on the precipice of it right now, those opportunities will present themselves more readily.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's awesome. And the second question is around STP Unit 2, what's left to do on that project in order for it to come back in early May?","David W. Crane","Mauricio, do you want to?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. So I mean right now, we're working on re-blading the turbine, the ones that were damaged, and we remain on track to be operational and available prior to the summer. So right now, our estimate is the beginning of May.","David W. Crane","And Neil, I mean Mauricio makes an important point there, and it's one of the points that sort of showed up in like our availability figures for 2012 as well. There's not much money to be made, to be frank, in the generation business during the shoulder seasons. But we are obviously focused like a laser beam on the conditions in Texas this summer. So the instructions we've given to the plant management at STP is obviously we want you to make these repairs as quickly as you can, but the most important thing is that you need to be there for the Texas summer, reliably operating. So if it takes an extra few days, take those extra days. So that's very much the sort of marching orders there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first, just following up on the GenOn subsidiary, talking about distributions and what expectations are. I know you commented already a little bit about debt paydown. But broadly speaking, what kind of distributions should we be looking for over this year and in the coming years? What's your stated policy, if you will?","David W. Crane","Julien, just to make sure, the question has to do with distributions up from the GenOn subsidiary up to the parent NRG and what you should expect in that front, is that what you're saying?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Absolutely.","David W. Crane","Okay. Kirk?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Well, first of all, Julien, as I think you're probably aware, there are RP constraints or restricted payments calculations largely similar to those in our own NRG indentures on the GenOn unsecured notes. And the impact of that is the -- and I think we made this clear in our annual disclosure this year and we talked about this before, there's about a $250 million basket that currently exists for distributions to NRG. Clearly, we're now, of course, the only sole shareholder at this point. Beyond that, there is an intercompany agreement for shared services between GenOn and NRG, where the way to think about it is the past and responsibilities that were formerly performed and represented by GenOn standalone G&A are now being performed by NRG, and there is an intercompany payment for those services provided by NRG to GenOn. Beyond that, there is an intercompany revolving credit facility relationship between the 2, and there are certain elements of the GenOn operations, which are currently -- which are not related to the specific physical assets, which are now being performed at the NRG level. So it's a combination of -- there are changes in the operations in terms of the flows. But in terms of degrees of freedom, with that $250 million basket combined with the significant payment annually that is basically a G&A compensation payment, that is the way to think about the flows between the 2 from a distribution standpoint. Hopefully, that addresses your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. And then just following up on capital allocation, broadly speaking, it seems like you have a number of organic investment opportunities this year, I'm thinking specifically Astoria and -- in LCAPP contracts still outstanding. How do you think about potentially pursuing those opportunities I suppose this year?","David W. Crane","Well, I mean look, the sort of development in the conventional space is the province of our regional presence. They've all -- we think we have a competitive advantage in terms of repowering at our existing sites with the cost savings and the locational advantages on the grid. Projects like Astoria, which I think is still the only fully permitted new project in the New York City zone -- if somebody gives us a creditworthy PPA, and we're off to the races. The one thing that I would say, of course, is that this goes back to the question of capital available for allocation. I mean on the conventional side, obviously, building a new power plant is an expensive proposition. But with long-term PPAs and project finance debt and all, and the equity sort of going in over the 2- to 3-year construction period, it's not likely actually to consume an enormous amount of our capital in 2013. So we would like to do as much as we can in terms of repowering, revitalizing at our existing sites. And certainly, Astoria is one of our top priorities for 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Deutsche Bank.","Keith Stanley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In New York, can you talk about your expectations for capacity pricing as it looks like they're raising their reserve margin and also the local capacity requirement in New York City, so any sort of directional expectation on prices there? And then also just -- could you remind me, do you generally hedge New York capacity prices much in advance or should we assume you receive close to the auction prices going forward?","David W. Crane","Okay. Mauricio?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. Keith, I mean we manage our capacity in a similar way as we do our energy, opportunistically and exerting some sort of market risk. So I think you already pointed out that in our rental state, the reserve margin requirement increased from 16% to 17% in New York City. Their locational capacity requirement actually moved up much higher than that, 83% to 86%. So the combination of that and then some retirement that we have seen, particularly around Vance Kammer [ph] , have really pushed off New York, both New York City and rental state prices significantly in 2013. We said in a couple of calls ago that we remain bullish in New York that we felt that the supply-demand balance could have shifted further quickly by changes in the supply side. We certainly did that. So I think it's fair to assume that we will benefit from it. But having said that, I just want to -- we do hedge our capacity portfolio, and you shouldn't account for one-to-one benefit on our portfolio.","Keith Stanley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in Texas, you've talked in the past about the year-round spark spread needed for a new CCGT to be economic. And there's been some news, I think about a week ago, that you were looking to potentially build some peaking capacity at the Robinson plant. How can we think about what's needed in Texas for you to move forward with the construction on peakers since that's more -- it seems like a trickier calculation based more on scarcity pricing and summer spark spreads?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. So in the past, we have given what I refer to as the cost of new entry spark spread around $30 per megawatt hour. The compensation of that spark spread is heavily biased towards the summer months. And if I have to point out, it's basically heavily biased towards a few hours of scarcity pricing. So clearly, the market seems a little bit weaker right now. If any generation will be built, it's more peaking capacity rather than combined cycle baseload capacity. Having said that, I think some of the construction that we're seeing, not just from us but other developer, sees project-specific. If you have an advantage or not, a specific project, whether you're sharing common facilities or you have access to favorable debt, I think those are the projects that are going to move forward now. I think there is a finite amount of those projects, and when you look at the amount of reserve or capacity that is required to meet the reserve margin that Texas is targeting, it's a whole lot more than what have been announced today.","David W. Crane","Keith, let me just add a little bit on that, too. Because you have to recognize there's the relatively unique situation we are in when it comes to those scarcity pricing moments in Texas with -- it's an opportunity on the generation side, but it's a time to play defense on the retail side. And we have a lot of peaking generation in Texas. But because of the legacy of where those plants came from, we don't have a lot of really fast-start peaking. And sometimes, you need to be able to move very quickly to capture those 1- or 2-hour time periods. So I think there's a whole bunch of reasons why the initiative you are talking about is not really -- it's a very specific niche need and opportunity for us that I think it's hard to draw sort of systemic-wide conclusions from that one instance.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. If I can just add one more thing, when we look at bringing some of these capacities, really around rejuvenating some of our older, slow-start capacity, so as we're bringing this new fast-start capacity, we're going to evaluate the -- all 3 of them and see if we need to require them or put them in low-cost price.","David W. Crane","Operator, Patrick, I mean we've gone a little bit over the hour, which is entirely our own fault because of our long-winded answers. I would like to -- I'm mindful of everyone's time. We'd like to accommodate 2 more callers, if we could. And then for the other callers in the queue, we'll get their names and Chad will follow up with myself and Mauricio and Kirk if necessary to make sure we get their questions answered. So let's take 2 more callers and then call it a day if we could.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to go back, Mauricio, to what you had mentioned about the sort of disconnect in PJM in 2015 in a sense that a large number of retirements and the forward curves don't appear to be indicative of where things would need to be. Can you speak a little bit to what catalyst might be needed to cause a correction in that regard or how you sort of see that disconnect playing out?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, from my perspective, it's two-fold. One is -- and I think from the chart, we break out announced retirements versus projected retirements. And when I think about projected retirements, they are generations that have been cleared, but not necessarily have been determined whether they're going to exit the market or not. So I think there is a lot of asset optimization and evaluations going on right now in the market. So that's one potential check in the supply-demand balance. The second one is demand response and whether or not we have hit acceleration point. So when you have 1\/2 of your reserve margin made up by demand response, and this is probably more a regulatory rather than a market question, how quickly we're going to level the playing field between demand response and generation. So if I have to point to 2, those would be the 2 big catalysts that will spark, I guess, a recovery on spark spreads.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up on retail, I wondered if you all could talk a bit about your experiences in expansion in the Northeast, what kind of competitive dynamics you're seeing. I know you have a number of clean energy initiatives there, but just more broadly as you expand there, what kind of competition are you seeing? Are margins in line with your expectations? Or how is that going?","David W. Crane","Great questions, Steve, and Jim Steffes is going to answer that question.","James Steffes","Sure. Thanks, David. I think in general, the Northeast markets, specifically the C&I side, they are competitive and highly competitive. As we expand, the markets give us different opportunities; each state, each market will be different. And we do see some pockets of opportunity. On the mass-market side, our margins are in line with what we're expecting, and we see continued growth in those markets.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Nobody asked the question about the upcoming PJM capacity auction. You are entering the auction with a very large portfolio. The market is highly consolidated at this point. You talked about the additional coal plant retirements. Could you tell us if some of those plants would be yours? And how -- and what are your expectations for the auction?","David W. Crane","Well, look, I'll leave it to Mauricio to probably not -- first of all, Angie, it makes my day to end this call by listening to your questions, but  equally it makes my day by basically not answering the questions. I'll leave that to Mauricio to talk to you about his expectations for the 2016, 2017. But let me start by not answering the first part of your question, which is in terms of future plant retirements, I mean our position going into this call is the same as before, the announcements that were previously made, which were made on the GenOn side, we have no reason at this point to sort of change the outcomes or add to that. Having said that, that's all part of the sort of asset review that we have underway, which is what's across the entire portfolio. But certainly, it's focused in the East, and specifically in the East, more in the PJM footprint than anywhere else. And so that's the sort of thing that you'll hear more from us about hopefully on the next quarterly earnings call. So the 2016, 2017 auction, Mauricio?","Mauricio Gutierrez","All right. So our price target is -- we haven't disclosed this. And all I can tell you is when we look at the parameters that were published earlier, there is a couple of plus and minuses. We actually think that the auction results may be sideways to slightly lower than the '15, '16 auctions. So I would leave it at that. In terms of asset optimization retirements, we are, as David already alluded, completely focused on doing a plant-by-plant evaluation on which units are going to continue operation and which units is not economical to put the back-end control. So that's going to be an ongoing conversation. I will tell you that earlier, we announced that the Gilbert and Werner, which were 2 plants that, in the past, GenOn had continuing operations beyond 2015, we actually have filed for the deactivation of mothball. So -- but there is a lot of, I guess, of evaluation going on right now. That's the only 2 that have been publicly announced, and I'll just leave it at that, Angie.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Angie, and thank you all for participating on the call. We apologize for going 8 minutes over, and we look forward to talking to you on the next quarter. Thank you, Patrick.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Please go ahead.","Matt Orendorff - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's first quarter 2015 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on the Investors Relations section of our website at www.nrg.com, under Presentations & Webcasts.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","As always, joining me today and participating in the presentation are Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer and President of NRG Business. Additionally, and available for questions are Chris Moser, who heads our Commercial Operations; Elizabeth Killinger, who's the head of Home Retail; and Kelcy Pegler, Jr., who's the head of Home Solar. Somewhat unusually, we're actually communicating with you from multiple locations, so if we run into some technological issues, please bear with us.","We've got a lot of great news to update you on today, and I realize we're starting slightly later than normal and during market hours, so we're going to get right into it and try and get through it as quickly as we can, give you all of the information you need.","Starting on slide three of the presentation, the story of NRG's first quarter 2015 is quite simple: record financial performance, $840 million of adjusted EBITDA, breaking our previous record which was set just last year. This achievement is truly remarkable given that that previous high in 2014 had received a substantial boost from the polar vortex which occurred in January of that year. But what's even more remarkable is that we beat the existing record in the face of very, very soft wholesale pricing in our core markets.","Average on-peak prices in PJM in the first quarter of 2015 were just 50% of what they were in the first quarter of 2014. In ERCOT, in the first quarter, the average on-peak prices were just 40% of what they were last year. In my mind and hopefully in yours, this is proof positive of the superiority of our integrated wholesale\/retail business model.","But of course, the right business model only gets you to the starting line. Our record first quarter performance is entirely attributable to the superb execution of our Plant Operations and Commercial Operations teams from the first day of the quarter to the last, so I wanted to publicly thank Mauricio, Chris Moser, Fran Sullivan and their respective teams for a quarter very well done. And I especially want to thank Elizabeth Killinger and her entire team at NRG Retail for simply hitting the ball out of the park with the stunning $166 million of adjusted EBITDA.","Moving to slide four, I want to note a couple critical issues on the slide that Mauricio and Kirk will cover more completely in their sections of the presentation. We realize that we're talking in the midst of a persistently challenging commodity price environments and NRG's conventional businesses are for the most part exposed to commodity price curve-based valuation. For that reason, it has become common in the market over the past several years for analysts to evaluate businesses like ours on an open EBITDA basis. While I have no particular problem intellectually or otherwise with open EBITDA analysis, it obviously fails to take into account the value of a savvy hedging program well executed on a timely basis. And that is what we have at NRG and that's what we've demonstrated.","For years, it's been the strategy of NRG to smooth out as much of the downward price curve volatility as we can through this active baseload hedging program. This quarter has been no exception. I'm very pleased with what our hedging team has accomplished, both with respect to the balance of 2015 and into 2016. As you all know, spot natural gas prices are indeed very low in particular, but we have seen this movie before back in 2012. We did okay then, and I'm confident we will do okay again now. And we'll navigate our way through this trough successfully thanks in significant part to the hedging program that Mauricio will shine some light on later.","The other topic I address on this slide, which also will be touched upon by both Mauricio and Kirk, is cash flow and capital expenditures. NRG always has been a cash flow generative machine. And indeed from the beginning of the new NRG era in 2003, I told our investors that we always would manage NRG for cash, and that has not changed. It has, however, been obscured recently by the fact that we are right in the middle of a three-year spike in our CapEx, arising largely out of the GenOn and EME acquisitions, as we spend an unusually large amount on major maintenance, environmental remediation, fuel conversions, and repowerings of our expanded fleet.","While we're not yet quite at the end of the tunnel with respect to this program, we are almost over the hump. Mauricio will show how the reinvestment program wraps up in 2016. And come 2017, NRG shareholders will experience the twin benefit, both of the EBITDA generated by those repowered and converted assets and also of the substantially greater free cash available for other allocations. Since we do expect to have substantially more capital to allocate, I think it's long past time that we, and particularly me, provide you with some simplified clarity as to how we think about capital allocation at NRG in the past and into the foreseeable future.","So if you turn to slide five, you will see two simple ways to think about capital allocation at NRG, what we call the 70%\/20%\/10% principle and the one-third rule, or the thirds rule. First, with respect to 70%\/20%\/10%, since NRG embarked on its present strategic course four years to five years ago, namely to continue to consolidate and flourish in the conventional power sector while positioning ourselves as an early mover in clean energy, we settled on a rough rule-of-thumb for our capital expenditures: 70% reinvestment in the assets and businesses that generate the preponderance of our current cash flow, 20% invested as equity capital in contracted assets that constitute the best and most realizable growth opportunities for NRG in the post-merchant era, and 10% invested into more speculative, early mover projects and businesses that have the potential to meaningfully expand the universe of opportunities for our business.","When describing the 70%\/20%\/10% rule internally, which is something we actually do a lot, it's not uncommon for us to draw the analogy to allocation of labor in agriculture. 70% of the time spent on harvesting, 20% of the time spent growing, and 10% planting seeds. While 70%\/20%\/10% is more a guideline for us than a hard and fast rule, it's a good metric and we believe it has served us and our shareholders well in terms of the current positioning of the company, and we plan to continue with it. We introduce it to you here to help you understand how we are thinking about reinvesting this cash-generative business over the next few years.","On the bottom half of slide five, I turn to a more recent and high-quality phenomenon, what to do with the substantial amount of cash proceeds to be returned to NRG as a result of asset dropdowns to NRG Yield. This is a highly relevant issue, as we expect roughly $600 million of dropdowns to NRG Yield to be announced over the balance of 2015. The way we think about this is that the removal on an unconsolidated basis of NRG's contracted and non-commodity exposed cash-generative assets over time from NRG's balance sheet to NRG Yield's balance sheet requires us to think about the pro forma NRG balance sheet left supporting the merchant, i.e., commodity exposed side of our business.","Without the contracted assets, it seems to us that the prudent thing to do is some right-sizing of that pro forma balance sheet, with such right-sizing involving both voluntary debt reduction and equity retirement. We also, of course, have to allocate some dropdown proceeds to restocking the pipeline of contracted assets for future dropdowns. As such, and Kirk will explain this further, we are announcing today a third, a third, a third rule associated with the receipt of future dropdown proceeds.","On a final note, and to amplify something I said on this topic when we announced the $100 million Phase II of our share buyback program in March, was that we believe, given how much the company's businesses have evolved over the past several years, there remains a significant disconnect and distortion between the company's performance and prospects on one hand and the commodity price curve lens through which Wall Street views us and anticipates our future performance on the other hand.","Witness, for example, the fact that we can be announcing here a record first quarter, projecting a full year result well in excess of $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA and clearly becoming a real player in the red-hot home solar space, and our stock is down some 50% since last summer, largely, I believe because we exist in a sub-$3 natural gas price environment. Surely there have been other contributing factors contributing to our abysmal share price performance, some of our own making, some of my own making, but this gas price environment looms largest notwithstanding its demonstrably reduced relevance to our near-term financial performance.","With the $80 million we added to the buyback bucket today and the $200 million of dropdown proceeds connected from buybacks that we expect to recharge the buyback program as the year goes on, I want to reiterate that we fully intend to enter the market to snap up our stock when it can be had at the exceptional bargain and current price levels.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone.","We're off to a good start in 2015 with our integrated platform performing exceptionally well during the quarter. A combination of higher retail loads in Texas, opportunistic hedging, and solid operational performance allowed us to once again report record financial results for the quarter. But more importantly, reaffirm guidance for the year.","Keep in mind these results were achieved despite the fact that wholesale power prices were 50% lower than last year, underscoring the importance of our integrated platform that performs under multiple price and weather scenarios. During the quarter, we also significantly increased our hedges in 2016, effectively protecting our earnings for the next two years, given our concerns on lower gas prices for this summer. In addition, our wholesale asset optimization and development program, which I will discuss in more detail in a few slides, remains largely on track.","Moving to our wholesale operational metrics on slide seven, we had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with 147 out of 167 facilities without a single recordable injury. Total generation was down 12% for the quarter on a pro forma basis, driven primarily by lower generation in the East where power prices were 50% lower than last year. In the Gulf, generation was flat as nuclear and gas generation offset lower coal production. And in the West, generation was impacted by the retirement of our Coolwater plant.","Reliability improved during the quarter, demonstrating our efforts to ensure that our units are available when it matters the most, during peak price periods. Over time, these metrics will become more relevant under the new capacity performance construct (13:59). The Operations team remains focused on executing our spring outage season with nearly 173 planned outages, a significant logistical task when you have more than 150 sites across your portfolio.","Turning to Home operations on slide eight, I am pleased to report that our Retail business had another strong quarter delivering $166 million in adjusted EBITDA, exceeding last year's first quarter by $51 million. These results were driven by effective margin and risk management combined with colder than normal weather and lower supply costs. Margins were strong and consistent with last year's quarterly performance despite the addition of lower margin Dominion loads. One year later, we continue to achieve better than expected results from the Dominion acquisition on both customer counts and EBITDA. Our customer count is performing in line with plans, given the anticipated Dominion contract expirations which we expect to be complete by year-end.","Additionally, we continued to make progress across our Home Solar segment. During the first quarter, our customer base increased to over 16,000 customers, an increase of 21% at the end of 2014. More importantly, however, during the month of April we entered into a new partnership with NRG Yield and executed on additional tax equity financings to help facilitate our growth through the end of the year. Kirk will discuss these in more detail.","Moving on to our market update on slide nine, and starting with the Northeast of the most immediate opportunity for our generation portfolio. As you can see in the left-hand chart, we're seeing very robust forward energy prices in PJM as supply tightens due to stricter environmental regulations benefiting our entire 17-gigawatt portfolio. In the medium term, the opportunity turns from energy to capacity margins with implementation of capacity reforms in PJM and New England, which focuses on higher reliability during shortage conditions.","This premium capacity product will most likely result in higher prices in exchange for higher penalties for non-performance. As a generator with a large and diverse portfolio with fuel onsite, we welcome these changes. Furthermore, our fuel conversion and compliance strategy enable us to capitalize on these opportunities.","Turning to our costs, I want to highlight the value of our integrated platform as a key differentiator versus solid generators. Not only were we able to outperform during a period of very low commodity prices, but in a time of lower liquidity in the market, we have a natural hedge between our wholesale portfolio and our retail franchise. In the medium term, we believe our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from a very fragile situation in Texas.","Currently, there are two divergent views in the market. ERCOT recently released their latest CDR report where they see reserve margins expanding by 5% in 2018 and beyond and putting them well above target reserve margins. This outlook, from our perspective, is a best case scenario, requiring three assumptions to happen at the same time: low load growth, incremental new supply and zero retirements. We're skeptical about this.","Over the past few years, loads grew at an average of 2% on a weather-normalized basis. We expect less than forecasted newbuilds as participants respond rationally to a very depressed forward market, and we expect greater than zero retirements given the challenging price environment and stricter environmental rules. When we do see a supply rationalization, our Texas fleet of surviving coal and gas units will be well-positioned to capture additional value.","Moving to our hedging disclosures on slide 10, we have turned our focus to 2016 where we have increased significantly our hedge levels to roughly 75%, effectively reducing our commodity risk and cash flow variations for the next two years. This is particularly important as we progress to higher than average CapEx years for our wholesale portfolio. I want to take a moment and briefly explain the 2015 hedge levels of 109%.","Remember that this percentage represents the amount of hedges sold against our currently expected generation, and I emphasize the word, expected. There will be times when the expected generation decreases due to market changes. And unless we immediately buyback our hedges, this will result in a hedge level above 100%. It is not that we over-hedged the portfolio but rather a timing issue on when we report results and when we buy some of our hedges back.","On the fuel side, we have seen significant decreases in commodity, fuel surcharges, and transportation costs this year. We're working closely with our coal supply chain partners to layer in additional hedges to balance our power sales.","Finally, on slide 11 is a summary of our asset optimization and development plan that I discussed with you on our last earnings call. I want to highlight three points that may not be fully appreciated. First, we're deploying this capital at very attractive returns. Attractive repowering (19:52) opportunities are good NRG Yield candidates where capital can be replenished at a premium, and the asset revitalization program in the East is done at very lower multiples compared to newbuild economics. Second, and as David mentioned in his remarks, this plan represents a significant commitment to our conventional business given the repowering opportunity that we see and the changes in capacity markets.","And finally, as you can see in the bottom right-hand chart, this plan is front-loaded in 2015 and 2016. Beyond that, there is very little incremental environmental CapEx to comply with existing regulations. Of course, as we identify new opportunities or see new environmental regulations, the outlook can change, but for now, there is a significant decrease in committed capital beyond 2016 that translates into additional free cash flow for the company.","As we turn our attention to the summer months, I want to reassure you that we are focused on executing on near-term market opportunities, repositioning our generation portfolio and leveraging our integrated platform.","With that, I will turn it over to Kirk.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone.","Turning to the financial summary on slide 13, for the first three months of 2015, adjusted EBITDA totaled $840 million, which is an increase of $23 million over the same period in 2014. NRG's record adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015 was achieved thanks to outstanding results from our wholesale and retail businesses and augmented by contributions from the assets acquired in the EME, Alta Wind, and Dominion transactions, which combined to more than offset the impact of the extreme weather in the first quarter of last year.","For the first quarter, free cash flow before growth totaled $364 million. Supported by our substantial hedge position and the strong start to the year, we are once again reaffirming both EBITDA and free cash flow guidance with our expectations continuing to track to the upper quartile of those ranges.","NRG also made substantial progress during the quarter on a number of fronts. Earlier this week, the public shareholders of NRG Yield approved a proposal to create two new share classes via a stock split, providing both ongoing capital replenishment for NRG and substantial funding capacity for Yield without the need for further NRG investment. With this important step now behind us, we are pleased to announce a new framework for the allocation of the portion of NRG's excess capital equivalent to future dropdown proceeds to be committed towards a balance of share repurchases, corporate debt reduction, and reinvestment in future NRG Yield-eligible projects.","Going forward, we expect residential solar leases to represent a meaningful portion of future dropdowns, thanks to a newly established partnership with NRG Yield, which will permit our Home Solar business to benefit by accessing more competitive cost of capital while providing a new source of CAFD growth for Yield. And having meaningfully expanded our Home Solar tax equity runway with two new facilities, we have the two key pieces in place to realize value at NRG today in excess of the capital requirements of this fast-growing business.","We have also established a similar new $100 million partnership with NRG Yield for future dropdowns of DG solar assets, which we expect to occur over the balance of 2015, providing further value realization at NRG and expanded growth for Yield. We will provide more details on this important partnership in the next quarter as we initiate our first DG solar dropdown. Finally, having completed $56 million of the $100 million second phase of our 2015 share buyback program, we are pleased to announce an increase of $81 million to this second phase; thereby, increasing remaining capacity to $125 million, providing us additional repurchasing power, which will be further augmented by future repurchases enabled by the NRG Yield dropdown one-third rule David mentioned earlier.","Turning to slide 14, I'd like to provide a few highlights of the recently approved NRG Yield recapitalization, which provides significant benefits to both companies. The creation of the 1\/100th vote Class C shares provides NRG Yield a substantial source of equity growth funding without reliance on NRG capital. These new C shares will be the primary source of future equity at NRG Yield, and the low vote structure gives Yield the ability to raise over $20 billion in new public equity without jeopardizing the strategic relationship with NRG.","The two-for-one stock split at NRG Yield will be effective May 14 with no change in total dividends paid. As a result, we have now also expanded the pipeline of ROFO assets to include 900 megawatts, consisting primarily of the EME wind assets which we expect to offer NRG Yield later this quarter. The expanded pipeline now also includes up to $250 million in residential solar and DG portfolios and 800 megawatts of long-term contracted gas comprised of our Carlsbad and Mandalay projects in California expected to reach COD in 2017 and 2020.","On slide 15 is a summary of the expected impact of our tax equity facilities and new NRG Yield partnership in realizing the key objective I first introduced at Investor Day in January: monetizing leases at value to NRG today. Partnering with Yield provides Home Solar access to competitively advantaged capital while enhancing NRG Yield's CAFD growth.","We've already dropped down approximately 2,000 existing leases to NRG Yield for $26 million in proceeds and, in addition, the $150 million equity commitment from NRG Yield and the associated tax equity proceeds provide capacity to monetize approximately 13,000 additional leases at value in excess of our expected capital requirements, leading to $100 million in near-term value to be realized by NRG in 2015.","This should also put us well along the path to realize total value which also exceeds G&A and marketing expenses for all of 2015 as we expect to seek future authorization to fund our ongoing leasing efforts over the balance of the year. NRG Yield will benefit from a targeted 7.5% CAFD yield over the lease term which equates to approximately $11 million in annual CAFD from its initial $150 million investment.","Turning to slide 16, I'd like to provide some additional details on the 70%\/20%\/10% capital expenditure guideline David mentioned earlier. The chart shows capital expenditures by year, which include maintenance and environmental CapEx as well as the growth investments portion of capital allocation. These are categorized by conventional, which is primarily wholesale and retail; proven growth, our contracted assets; and high-growth opportunities. To provide some historical perspective, I've included 2013 and 2014.","Turning to 2015, NRG has committed $1.7 billion in capital expenditures. Approximately 70% is a reinvestment in our conventional businesses which provide the bulk of NRG's cash-generative power and is largely comprised of our asset optimization projects, environmental capital which includes the Midwest Gen assets, and maintenance to ensure reliability across the fleet. We've committed 20% to Yield-eligible contracted assets, including residential solar and DG solar and approximately 10% to eVgo and our Carbon 360 projects.","In 2016, we expect $1.6 billion in total CapEx, consistent with 70%\/20%\/10% as we complete our environmental and asset optimization programs and bring Carbon 360 to COD in early 2017. We expect to continue our Yield-eligible investment program in 2016, Yield on (28:27) our one-third rule which will then include spend on our California contracted gas plants.","Beyond 2016, as I mentioned on Investor Day, having completed our environmental programs to bring the fleet to current compliance, we expect a significant reduction in currently committed capital of over $500 million which is also aided by the completion of the Carbon 360 project and the reduction in maintenance CapEx. This should provide significant capital allocation flexibility and help ensure the continued delivery of robust free cash flow.","Turning to slide 17, NRG expects to offer assets to NRG Yield over the remainder of 2015 with anticipated equity proceeds totaling approximately $600 million. These dropdown proceeds are expected to be realized in two equal tranches to be offered in the second and fourth quarter of the year with the first consisting primarily of the EME wind assets, and the second anchored by the remaining stake in CVSR, currently held by NRG. We also expect to drop down residential solar and DG portfolios over the course of the year.","In order to provide greater clarity, maintain our target ratios and continue to return capital to shareholders, we are announcing a new plan as a part of capital allocation based on future dropdown proceeds. We will allocate capital in an amount consistent with these proceeds in thirds towards share repurchases, corporate debt reduction, and investment in future Yield-eligible projects. The allocation to debt reduction is sized to offset the impact on corporate EBITDA from the portion of CAFD which will support dividends paid to NRG Yield's public shareholders, thereby allowing us to maintain our key credit metrics following each dropdown.","Sizing our capital allocation to share repurchases should help further clarify the direct benefit of NRG Yield to our shareholders. These future buyback allocations are incremental, the expansion of Phase II of our buyback program we announced today. Recycling the remaining proceeds helps replenish the dropdown pipeline with greater capital efficiency.","Turning to slide 18, by adding the expected proceeds from dropdown offerings over the remainder of 2015, NRG's gross capital available for allocation is just over $3 billion this year. Inclusive of the impact of the one-thirds plan and the expanded Phase II buyback program, we have committed $2.2 billion of this capital, nearly half of which is allocated to preserving balance sheet strength and returning capital to our shareholders.","Committed growth of $960 million represents the growth component of the 70%\/20%\/10% capital expenditures guideline I reviewed earlier. Of the $860 million in excess capital then remaining in 2015, $500 million resides at the GenOn level, a portion of which will fund the completion of our operational improvement program there in 2016. NRG level excess capital is $360 million, which includes the portion of the one-thirds plan earmarked for future NRG Yield-eligible investment.","And in summary on slide 19, in addition to our excellent quarterly performance, our enhanced capital allocation program, NRG Yield recap and new NRG Yield partnerships place NRG on firm footing to ensure continued balance sheet strength and expanded return of shareholder capital while harnessing the power of the NRG Yield cost of capital to benefit our growing Home Solar, DG, and contracted asset initiatives.","With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you, Kirk, and thank you, Mauricio. And operator, I think I'll dispense with closing remarks so we can just take questions from people on the phone. So if you'd open the lines?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, and congratulations on multiple fronts.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to just talk about leveraging your Retail business in the pursuit of your clean energy growth. Can you just talk a little bit about lessons learned, and how is that actually working day-to-day in terms of being able to use that Retail platform?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Stephen, it's a great question, and I could go on about how excited I am about the prospects there, but since we have the two experts in the room, why doesn't Elizabeth give her impression first and then Kelcy?","Elizabeth Killinger - SVP & President, NRG Retail, NRG Energy, Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Stephen. So we really are making strong progress on cross-selling, and as you've heard from us before, we've been working on this together. And I'll give you two examples. The first is the example of selling our electricity customers an incremental product. And in Texas, we have seen great success there with about 22% of our customers buying more than one product from us. And we have moved out of our trial phase and really are gaining momentum in the East where we are selling our solar customers electricity products, and we are also generating solar leads within our electricity conversations and sharing them with Kelcy's business.","And at the end of the day, those are just examples of our kind of our plus concept. So if a customer starts with us as an electricity customer, the plus there would be home solar or backup generation or some of our warranty products or other new products we offer. And on \u2013 if they start as a solar customer, we can add electricity or backup generation or, again, other products. So I'll toss it over to Kelcy for anything else he might add.","Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar","Yeah. I think Elizabeth covered it well. We're moving from the early days into some meaningful progress, especially in the lead transition of sharing within the business groups. And I think overall, from the cross-selling, the bundling, and the up-selling perspective, with recent news around solar-plus-battery being a winning concept, I think we feel validated in the solar-plus or electricity-plus strategy because we think it's a little more comprehensive of being able to put electricity, solar, EV charging, portable power, backup generation, which could include a battery, or natural gas generators. So we feel validated in our strategy there.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And I just wanted to shift over to the partnership on distributed generation. Is this the form of relationship that we should be thinking on a going-forward basis? Or is this more opportunistic in the near-term? Just wanted to get a better sense if this is the sort of model that you all prefer going forward here with distributed generation?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You mean in terms of the way that the Yield and NRG are working together on Home Solar leases, and down the road on business to business? Is that...","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kirk, do you want to address that?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Stephen, the high-level answer to that is, yes, and is for the same reason for both distributed solar and residential solar. And that is just the ongoing continual nature of the opportunity set combined with the fact that, as you know, now that we've shifted from cash grants exclusively, really into ITCs, that requires that the equity funding basically be locked down once we reach COD. So for that reason, it's important for us to have capacity to be flexible and nimble when those opportunities present and they tend to do so on a sort of a rolling and ongoing basis, and so that affords us the ability to be nimble on both DG and residential solar. And broadly speaking, the structure of those two partnerships in terms of the sharing of cash flows between NRG and NRG Yield, especially NRG towards the residual as we retained the recontracting ability will be similar between those two partnerships.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And maybe just to follow up on the structure, Kirk, in terms of the return threshold at which there is that effective flip, is there any color you can provide or are you not quite at that point that you want to provide that (37:15).","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The only thing \u2013 I'd say it this way is that the CAFD yield, which is an average, and I'm using the example more tangibly from the residential solar partnership, that 7.5% yield is a good way to think about the economics, or at least the sharing, the cash flows, that are represented by that 95% that goes to NRG Yield.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, guys. I \u2013 just on the buyback update, which was helpful, can you walk us through, in addition to the recycling of the cash from drops to NYLD kind of how you're thinking about an allocation of cash between the free cash generation from the business as well as the proceed dropdown? So are there buckets we should be thinking about more comprehensively of all the cash you're generating?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kirk, do you want to take that?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. The committed piece, and I'm speaking specifically \u2013 I think your question, Dan, was directly on the buyback front, the predictable component of that, the committed piece of that is the one-thirds of the dropdown proceeds that is earmarked for share repurchases. And while certainly we can opportunistically supplement that with additional capital allocation is really anchored by the free cash flow, a good example of which is the $81 million we added today, we maintain that flexibility. But the committed part of it is the one-thirds piece from the Yield dropdown.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So the free cash generation from the core business is going to follow the same strategy of using it as you see the best and brightest use at that point in time.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I think that's a safe summary, yes.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then I guess just on the Carlsbad plant, the CPUC deferred a decision yet again. What is your thinking as far as where their holdouts are on that project, and are there alternatives to you guys if they decide not to approve development of that property?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, certainly we hope, I mean in a world of getting things approved in California, this is pretty much a par for the course and we certainly support President Picker's alternative decision, and I think that they're now going to make a final decision in just a couple weeks, I think May 19 or May 21 or something like that, so we certainly hope it goes the right way because we think the plant is obviously the right solution for Southern California in the absence of the SONGS plant. But I mean, if it does go the other way, I mean, the project's not dead yet, it's just that the path to approval becomes longer and a little bit more opaque, and so at the very least I think there would be a delay, and we certainly hope for our sake and for the sake of California, that that's not the case.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. I'll stay to my two questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Could I just ask about the Home Solar customer adds? It looks like you added less than 3,000 in the quarter. Is it seasonality, weather-related, or should we just expect the ramp to really pick up later in the year? Just how we kind of view that Q1 result in the context of what I guess is like 20,000-odd adds you wanted to do this year?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Jonathan, I mean Kelcy \u2013 I'll ask Kelcy to address the question looking forward, but certainly I think your assessment of the first quarter is correct. First of all, we always anticipated a high ramp rate quarter-on-quarter during the year, but there's no doubt that our Home Solar business, which is a little unusual compared to the other main home solar companies in that we start as an East Coast-based home solar company, and you can imagine that no one in Massachusetts which is one of the biggest markets was thinking about, or executing on putting home solar on their roof from about the first of February through mid-March. So it was definitely weather impacted, but I mean we're confident for the rest of the year. And Kelcy can give you a little flavor of that. Kelcy?","Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar","Yeah. Thanks, David. And I think you've framed it properly. We were impacted by Northeast weather which was extreme in states like Massachusetts and Connecticut especially. They had snow on the ground for better parts of four weeks at a time. But we've always recognized that our full year will have a ramp through that full year. If we experience similar growth rates from what a 2014 experienced, we're confident we're right in that ballpark for our full year number in 2015. We did gain considerable ground on some meaningful progress with both the partnership with Yield which you heard Kirk talk about, and extending our tax runway. So there's a lot of progress, and not the least of which is really gaining a foothold in the California market which will help mitigate that seasonality that we experienced in Q1 in future quarters.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Can I just ask about Carlsbad? Is the spending in the numbers? Not in the numbers? How should we think about that?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kirk?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Jonathan, there is no meaningful amount of spend currently in that, as it would ordinarily be the case in the growth investments component of capital allocation. We expect the preponderance of that spend to really begin in earnest in 2016.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just one simple question. Back at the Analyst Day, I think you had highlighted for 2015 that you were already kind of tracking to the maybe the upper half of the range for this year. And maybe you could just comment on that. Obviously, the first quarter was very good.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I actually think we said to the upper quarter of the range. And we're still tracking to that same upper quarter. But if I didn't say, or if Kirk didn't say upper quarter, then we're saying it now.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I actually did.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. I'm not going to ask questions about solar for once. But there is, you guys have shown us this integrated platform between the generation assets and the retail assets, especially your cash flows and earnings and volatility associated with natural gas prices. And we're seeing that one of the UK utilities has just put a big retail business in the U.S. for a strategic review. And I know that there's a bit of an overlap in retail services territories. And I know you don't comment on specific transactions, but could you, in general, tell us is it possible for you to enlarge your retail presence, especially in Texas?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Wow. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, I think certainly we would look to expand retail where we could do so at value. I mean, we like the platform we have. I mean, unlike when we bought Green Mountain or Energy Plus, I mean, we have the brands, and we have what we need. But we would look at other portfolios. I don't \u2013 I'm not sure I actually even know which portfolio you're talking about, but I can guess by the way you frame the question. I don't actually have any insights on whether or not there's a market share issue. But it's safe to say that if there's not a market share issue, we would look at anything in the retail space. Elizabeth, do you want to comment on that?","Elizabeth Killinger - SVP & President, NRG Retail, NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I think you hit it on the head. But I would add, we are passionate about our Retail business and the Texas market. And to the degree, we can acquire either additional customers through acquisition or normal channels, we always look at opportunities to do so.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And the second one, more generic about M&A as well. So if you now have new classes of shares for NRG Yield that could allow you for third-party acquisitions. How should we think about it if you were, if both of the companies were to acquire existing portfolio of operating assets, would it be immediately dropdown into NRG Yield, and as such, boasts near-term distribution growth. Or would it be, in a way, warehoused at NRG or at some other facility in order to be preserved for future dropdowns in order to basically expand the growth of distributions into the future?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Angie, it's a very situationally-specific answer to that question. I mean we've really looked at every situation. I mean led by the independent directors at NRG Yield, they have repeatedly said they want to remain true to the idea that there's very specific risks they're willing to take, and a lot of risks that they're not willing to take. And if there's a big acquisition, half merchant, half contracted, and it has a lot of integration that has to be done and all that, they want to see that done at NRG first, and then receive the contracted assets when they're settled down. On the other hand, they've done direct acquisitions of assets which they perceived, and we perceived, didn't require a lot of new risk taking on their part. So it's really case by case is the best I could tell you.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So wanted to come back to the conventional portfolio for a quick minute here. On Maryland, just if you could give a little bit more of an update around intentions there and the latest on the regulations, as well as at the GenOn fleet on Bowline? Is it your intention still to move forward there and bring that unit back up? Or fully back up, shall we say?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mauricio, do you want to take that?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, David. And good morning, Julien. So as you know, Maryland implemented an emergency ruling for 2015 setting up a specific limit that can be complied across the entire portfolio. We continue to work with MDE in a solution that doesn't necessarily require a unit-by-unit NOS (49:01) limit that could potentially lead to additional environmental equipment or potentially fuel conversion of that, and these market conditions are not economic. So we will continue to work with them to find a solution that is consistent with other federal regulations in terms of compliance at a total portfolio level.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","And then on Bowline?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","On Bowline, I mean we are \u2013 we're moving and rerating our units. We have invested already that capital at very attractive multiples, and we are bringing additional megawatts given the pricing conditions that we're seeing in the lower Hudson Valley.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then a bigger thematic question here; obviously, a lot on storage of late, but I'm curious, how big of an opportunity do you all see it? And then I suppose, specifically given the diversity of your current businesses, where do you see the best opportunity? Is it the C&I space? The utility scale space? I mean just curious how you all are thinking about tackling that opportunity here?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. You \u2013 I'm sorry. You said, specifically in storage?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, indeed.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean I think that we see the biggest opportunity, and we've had some success there in sort of California's preferred resources where there's a contract for it. I mean from my perspective, and particularly the more distributed you get, sort of merchant storage, if you will, is \u2013 I think is still some ways away from being a significant opportunity.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I only have one question, but it's in 27 parts.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, thank you, thank you, we appreciate that. It's \u2013 well that's just what we wanted on a Friday after \u2013 Friday morning.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Oh, three quick ones. Just to clarify your answer to a prior question. The $1.6 billion of CapEx in 2016 currently budgeted, that would go up if Carlsbad were approved?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","David, you want me to take that?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry, Kirk. Go ahead.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Greg, I would not expect that to \u2013 the approval to have an impact on the $1.6 billion. From a timing perspective, while there may be a small amount of capital towards the end of the year, in any circumstance, I would still expect the bulk of the capital towards Carlsbad to really be in earnest in 2016.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But he asked...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","In 2016 or in 2017?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","He asked in 2016.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, forgive me. I thought you said 2015. Yeah...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...so it would \u2013 yes, it would start in 2016. Sorry about that.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So that would be \u2013 you would \u2013 so the $1.6 billion would go up?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","The second question was with regard to the excess capital remaining, the $860 million of which $500 million is at GenOn and $360 million at NRG. You said \u2013 I think you said $200 million of that is associated with sort of the replenishment of NRG Yield eligible assets, so that means for all intents and purposes there's $160 million for the balance of this year that's unallocated?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kirk?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So when you're looking at the $360 million that's at the bottom there, that's correct, although I would say within the $960 million of committed capital that's on the growth investments page, that really includes the line of sight we have right now on the remaining NRG Yield-eligible assets. So while $200 million of that $360 million is the one-thirds component that goes towards Yield-eligible assets, I would expect those dollars more likely to be spent in 2016 and moving forward. I don't see a significant increase right now in allocations or towards Yield-eligible investments other than that which is already subsumed within that $960 million of growth capital.","I do want to go back to your question. I apologize for the confusion over 2015 and 2016. When you go to the slide on capital expenditures, I said that Carlsbad would be an increase, that \u2013 I want to clarify that point. We provided that 2016 number for a reason and part of the committed capital in there is the Carlsbad plant and the Mandalay plant. So forgive me for misunderstanding your question. That is included in the 2016 capital expenditures.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. That was exactly what I needed. Thank you. And the final question for Mauricio, I think in the first quarter vis-\u00e0-vis how the stock price traded, people definitely forgot how strong a sort of countercyclical hedge your Retail business is relative to your wholesale position in Texas. Look, you haven't changed your 2015 guidance for Home Retail, but if we continue to see depressed gas prices and depressed spark spreads, depressed wholesale prices in Texas for an extended period of time, given the tenor of your contracts, how do you think you trend in that $575 million to $650 million guidance range through the rest of the year?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I mean, keep in mind that you need two elements for an over performance in Retail. Not only do you need lower commodity prices that translate in lower supply costs, but you also need higher loads given to extreme weather conditions. In the case of Q1, you have colder than normal weather. So as we look at the rest of the year, I think it's a little too early to tell how weather's going to play out, and I'm not going to \u2013 I mean, it's a little disingenuous to start making predictions about whether it's going to be hotter than normal or not. But certainly, if those two elements present themselves in the summer, we can expect retail to over-perform.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you, gentlemen. Have a good morning.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Chin from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Brian J. Chin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","My questions were asked and answered. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Caylor from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ryan Caylor - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Hi. Good morning.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Ryan Caylor - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","So my questions were answered regarding Carlsbad, but regarding the other California repowering project added to the NYLD ROFO list, given there's CapEx allocated to both in 2016, can you provide us with an update, I guess, on Mandalay and whether there's any read-throughs from the Carlsbad process?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's a good question. I don't know of any \u2013 I think they're quite independent of each other, but I would say I'm not perfectly informed on that. Mauricio, do you have any viewpoint on that?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I mean, I think the Mandalay project is back at the end of the decade, so what we provided to you is in the next two years. The capital required for that project would be in the latter part of the decade, so I don't think it's reflected on the numbers. Kirk?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not reflected on the numbers, and I'm not aware of any read-through in terms of the situation with the Carlsbad project onto Mandalay, no.","Ryan Caylor - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Okay, great.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Cole, you may begin.","Kevin L. Cole - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's second quarter 2016 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investor section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcasts.","As of this earnings call, any statements made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date.","Actual results may differ materially.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business.","Today, we're reporting second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $779 million, a 14% increase when compared to the same period last year, thanks to a solid performance from the Generation business and a record second quarter result for Retail, which continues to benefit from lower wholesale prices, a proven ability to attract and retain customers, and outstanding execution. These are excellent results particularly in light of the low commodity prices that we continue to experience in our core markets. And it once again validates our integrated model and diversified approach to competitive power markets.","Given the back-to-back strong quarterly results and the hedge position we have in place for the remainder of the year, we're not only reaffirming guidance, but we're tracking towards the upper end of our range.","Traditionally, this quarter is a quiet one, our shorter season, since demand for electricity and respective wholesale prices are the lowest for the year, but for us, it was rather busy. In addition to ensuring our fleet was ready for summer operations, we made significant progress in executing on our debt management plan. We have retired $337 million of corporate level debt year-to-date, reduced our 2018 to 2020 maturity debt obligation by $5.8 billion, and bought back $345 million of our convertible preferred stock.","Kirk will go into more detail in a few slides, but I want to take a moment to recognize him and the entire finance and legal organizations for superb execution and timing. The progress made today is an important step to ensure that our leverage ratios remain on target through varying commodity cycles.","In delivering on our commitment to enhance capital flexibility, we have entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to drop down our 51% interest in CVSR with $180 million in total cash consideration, including financing proceeds and an EBIT to EBITDA multiple of over 14 times. This transaction reinforces the value of our partnership, allowing us to replenish capital efficiently while further expanding yields portfolio and (04:04), which benefits our nearly 50% economic interest on them.","Proceeds from this transaction will be allocated towards deleveraging, specifically to supplement the reserves set aside for our 2018 bonds, expanding our total deleveraging target from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.","This quarter, we also finalized the sale of Rockford and the Aurora plants for $425 million, bringing total cash consideration from asset sales to $563 million, which surpasses our initial target of $500 million. We have remained relentless in our pursuit of streamlining the organization and finding additional cost savings.","We are on track to achieve our fornrg cost reduction target of $400 million through 2017 and to reduce our CapEx program by $650 million for 2017. This CapEx reduction follows the successful completion of fuel conversions at New Castle and Joliet and environmental upgrades at Avon Lake, with all three plants back on line and better positioned to take advantage of opportunities in their respective markets.","Now turning to slide 4. I want to highlight the strong performance of our integrated platform during the second quarter. Safety is always top of mind. And while we remain a top quartile performer year-to-date, we can do and have done better. We are focused on and committed to improving our safety record for the balance of the year.","The mild weather continued from the winter months into the start of the summer with temperatures that were milder than last year. Needless to say, this kept commodity prices through the end of June lower than last year. But once again, our business delivered results that were even stronger than last year. You have heard me say this before, but this is exactly what differentiates NRG from other IPPs. We have an integrated platform that can provide stability and deliver strong results even during periods of low prices while maintaining significant upside. And we continue to demonstrate this quarter after quarter.","Our Generation business performed well, with improvements in reliability, availability and operating cost while realizing higher capacity revenues. We successfully completed multiple CapEx projects, bringing several units back on line for the summer.","In fact, during the first month of operations, our fuel conversions benefited from low gas prices in PJM and are performing even better than expected. Our fleet was also well-positioned to maximize value in the recent 19\/20 PJM capacity auction.","Results were disappointing, given the reduction in loads and increase in newbuilds, except in ComEd where prices remain strong benefiting our Midwest Gen portfolio. Overall, we cleared about 80% of all our megawatts in PJM for total revenues of over $0.5 billion.","While these market conditions were not ideal for the generation of business, the low wholesale prices benefited our complimentary Retail business. Beyond favorable supply cost this quarter, our Retail business continued its push for cost efficiencies, customer retention and product expansion.","This is a business that continues a trajectory of growth and has proven to be very stable. I want to commend Elizabeth and the Retail team for their achievement this quarter and for continued success in growing this business.","But while the Retail business on our pivot towards becoming a capacity player, an important part of the story, the NRG value proposition is even more robust than that.","Turning to slide 5. I want to put some of the recent market trends in context of NRG's multiple leverage for value creation as I outlined on our last call. The first lever is our stable but growing base of price of the most predictable parts of our portfolio. Retail, which continues to demonstrate the stability of its earnings, capacity revenues that provides visibility multiple years into the future, and contracted assets through NRG Yield. This first lever has proven solid over time, and there is good reason to believe that our base will only grow and strengthen given current market trends.","We are encouraged by the support for constructive capacity markets and strict performance standards but we're even more encouraged by the increasing need for contracted renewable and quick-start gas plants that are required to meet higher renewable portfolio standards, and the sustainability targets of corporations across the country. We are ready to capitalize on this market opportunity, which is even further enhanced by our partnership with NRG Yield.","Now, turning to the other two levers of our value proposition. Our leverage to natural gas and power. Both less predictable, but with significant upside potential given where we are in the commodity cycle. Let's start with our leverage to natural gas. We have deliberately maintained fuel diversity in our portfolio, and can therefore benefit from the price differential between coal and uranium to natural gas. Our long gas position is about 3.3 bcf a day.","I am encouraged by the price, supply, and demand outlook. We have seen a significant increase in spot prices from the recent lows; production has been stagnant, reflecting an unsustainable low-price environment, and demand is picking up, particularly in the power sector. If the price of gas moves by $0.50, NRG would realize almost $0.5 billion in additional gross margin, 2\/3 of which is realized at the NRG level, and with minimal impact on our Retail business since most of our fixed-price obligations are short-term and hedged.","The last lever is our exposure to power prices for heat rates. Our upside is also significant as we have the largest and most diverse fleet in the country, with close to 43 gigawatts of merchant generation. While we're seeing the market tightening due to unit retirements, the outlook for power is more neutral, given the increased uncertainty from environmental regulations, and the recent actions to subsidize on economic generation by certain states. We will continue to work with our generators, regulators, and stakeholders to protect the integrity of competitive markets.","As you can see, the outlook for the business overall is positive, and no other company offers investors a play in the industry in the same way that our business does. We're not one-dimensional when it comes to creating value, and we're able to handle downturns better than others. We do not bet on a single fuel or on a single technology. We have embraced vertical integration and diversification as a way to navigate through a sea of uncertainty in our industry. I have no doubt our business is best positioned for both nearer- and longer-term success in the industry.","I want to take a few minutes to share some thoughts on two of our key markets, ERCOT and PJM. Let's first start with ERCOT on slide 6. We're seeing signs of market recovery as dark spreads have increased over 100% from their lows even outpacing the rebound in spark spreads by a healthy margin. As an owner of an environmentally controlled coal unit in the region, we certainly welcome this move. So far, this summer has been characterized by consistently warm weather, of higher than normal wind production in July, and a healthy grid have resulted in little to no scarcity pricing.","While the forward markets have improved, we have been disappointed that the PUCT have not taken swifter action to correct the demand curve to provide better market signals. That said, we do expect positive revisions to the ORDC later this year to better reflect scarcity conditions in prices.","Finally, there is still an overhang of uncertainty from several environmental regulations in Texas most notably, regional haze. This could delay the decision to retire uneconomic and uncontrolled assets for some time, but ultimately, the investment to comply will prove difficult for these type of units under current market conditions. We remain confident that our large environmentally-controlled and favorably-located assets are well-positioned to meet compliance thresholds with modest capital investments.","PJM is somewhat a different story moving from a market with high energy and capacity prices that incentivizes new generation to one with energy margins under pressure. The massive turnover from coal and oil to natural gas is starting to impact spark spreads as more efficient combined cycles are coming online. In looking at both energy and capacity prices for the 2019-2020 period, we're now below the cost of new entry for a new CCGT. (13:40-13:52)","We expect the next auction for 2020 to 2021 to be more constructive as we believe a move into 100% capacity performance requirement, a potential slowdown in newbuilds, and a more moderate load revision will support higher capacity prices. We are encouraged by the constructive nature of the capacity market and its efforts to better reward unit reliability.","Our investments are consistent with these market dynamics, and rest assured that we will continue to oppose the use of state-based contracts and subsidies that undermines well-functioning competitive markets.","During my first call as CEO back in February, I committed to simplifying our business. This meant not just simplifying how we communicate our value proposition to the market, but also the internal structure and interworking of the organization. In that spirit, it's not lost on me that we need to extend the simplification to our capital structure. So addressing GenOn has been one of my priorities for 2016.","On slide 7, I wanted to shed some light on the situation as it currently stands. The GenOn portfolio has allowed us to fill a gap we had in PJM, a strategic market as we were building a diverse portfolio across all major competitive markets. This position was later complemented with the acquisition of an additional 4,000 megawatts from Edison Mission.","Over the last few years, we have taken steps to capitalize on evolving market trends, particularly around changes in the capacity market. However, deteriorating market fundamentals are adversely impacting the GenOn portfolio. Abundant shale gas, more stringent environmental regulations, and an influx of new efficient gas plants which are causing significant pressure on energy and capacity prices in the region. This low commodity cycle is impacting the financial scale of the GenOn entity, as you can see in upper left-hand table.","Currently, the leverage ratio for the consolidated GenOn entity is 7.7 times. This level of debt relative to EBITDA is successive, particularly as NRG seeks to maintain a long-term corporate level leverage ratio target of 4.25.","GenOn has taken several important steps to address the challenges it faces. First, it has appointed two independent directors to the GenOn board. It is a key step in ensuring that the interest of all stakeholders in GenOn are considered.","Second, it has retained restructuring advisors to help navigate the process efficiently and judiciously. Third, it has opportunistically solved several non-core assets over the past several quarters who helped provide additional financial flexibility within the general complex.","I know that many of you have a lot of questions on GenOn, but I am sure you can appreciate this is a sensitive process, and as GenOn is engaged in ongoing conversations with its stakeholders, we are unable to elaborate on the specifics at this time. I expect to provide more information as this process moves forward.","What I can leave with you today is the reminder that as this process progresses and options are evaluated, there are three key principles that we will adhere to: simplifying the organization; maximizing value; and from NRG's perspective, maintaining the strength of the NRG balance sheet and credit metrics.","So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on slide 9, NRG delivered $779 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by a strong performance by our Retail mass business, achieving a record EBITDA of $213 million.","For the second quarter, Generation and Renewables combined for $326 million in adjusted EBITDA, while NRG Yield contributed $240 million. For the first half of the year, NRG generated almost $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $220 million of free cash flow before growth.","Based on both performance year-to-date and our updated outlook for the balance of the year, which has us tracking to the upper end of our EBITDA range, we are reaffirming our 2016 guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth.","We expect to update and narrow these ranges, following the completion of the summer season on our third quarter call in November and we'll also provide guidance for 2017 at that time.","During the second quarter call and into July, NRG made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility, as we took advantage of favorable market conditions, by significantly extending corporate maturities while continuing our deleveraging efforts.","Since we embarked on our current corporate debt reduction program in the fourth quarter of 2015, we have now retired a total of $642 million of NRG level debt. In addition, through two successful unsecured notes offerings totaling $2.25 billion, NRG significantly extended corporate maturities at lower rates, than the shorter dated maturities which were retired using the proceeds from these offerings. We also successfully extended both our corporate revolver from 2018 to 2021, and our secured term loan from 2018 to 2023. These transactions, when combined with the overall debt reduction achieved since late last year, result in approximately $50 million in annualized interest savings for NRG. Taking into account the $10 million in annualized dividend savings we captured in the second quarter through the redemption of our convertible preferred, interest and dividend savings combined drive incremental improvements in free cash flow before growth on an annual basis at the NRG level of approximately $60 million.","Finally, NRG has just entered into an agreement with NRG Yield to sell our remaining 51% interest in CVSR, resulting in expected cash proceeds to NRG of approximately $180 million. These proceeds are derived from two sources. First, taking advantage of incremental secured debt capacity at CVSR. In July, we closed on $200 million in new non-recourse secured debt. NRG's share of the net cash proceeds of which is $101.5 million. Second, we agreed to sell our remaining 51% stake in CVSR to NRG Yield for $78.5 million in cash and expect that transaction to close this quarter.","The total cash proceeds from these transactions further increase NRG level capital for allocation, which you'll find updated on slide 10. Turning to that slide, 10, the cash proceeds of $180 million from the CVSR transaction increased total 2016 NRG level capital available for allocation to just under $1.9 billion. The proceeds from CVSR also increased the portion of NRG level capital allocated to debt or convertible preferred reduction, which now stands at just under $1.5 billion for 2016.","On our first quarter call, we had earmarked the net proceeds of $210 million from our Midwest Generation capacity monetization toward the potential redemption of our convertible preferred stock. Having now redeemed the convert for $226 million versus the $210 million reserve we'd established for that purpose, a portion of the CVSR proceeds helps make up the difference, or $16 million. $59 million of the CVSR proceeds was used to offset the financing fees incurred in connection with the maturity extensions, allowing us to maintain the total capital allocated toward absolute debt reduction. The balance of the CVSR proceeds or $105 million, will be used to increase the reserve established for the remainder of our 2018 notes, from $325 million to now, $430 million.","Turning now to slide 11 for an update on the NRG level capital structure and leverage ratios. As a result of our significant progress in debt reduction and maturity extension, the remaining balance of our 2018 unsecured notes now stands at only $587 million and is our only remaining outstanding debt maturing prior to 2021.","Looking to NRG's maturity profile in the upper left of that slide, including our corporate revolver as of the third quarter of last year, NRG had about $6.7 billion in total debt maturities through 2020. To put our progress toward strengthening our balance sheet into perspective, as a result of the continuing deleveraging and opportunistic refinancings, today, we have less than $900 million maturing through 2020. A reduction of approximately $5.8 billion in less than a year.","While we'll continue to be opportunistic when market conditions are favorable, this increased flexibility allows us to be more selective, and less exposed to the type of short-term swings and volatility in the debt markets we saw earlier in 2016. The added benefit, as I mentioned earlier, is that in the process we've already achieved approximately $60 million in annual dividend and interest savings, which similar to the significant decrease in environmental CapEx which follows 2016, helps further improve our ability to translate EBITDA into free cash flow in 2017 and beyond.","Finally, as you can see in the updated table in the upper right-hand of the slide, we remain on track to drive our corporate debt-to-EBITDA ratio well below our long-term target of 4.25, allowing us to maintain adherence to the principles of prudent balance sheet management through the commodity cycle.","We're very pleased with our progress on the balance sheet side and I want to recognize the folks in our finance, accounting, and legal departments in particular for their outstanding efforts this year in making these successes possible and moving NRG forward in achieving our balance sheet goals for 2016.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kirk. To close, I want to leave you with our scorecard on slide 13. We have made excellent progress on all our stated objectives from simplifying the company and streamlining costs to strengthening our balance sheet and creating financial flexibility to better manage this commodity cycle.","Importantly, I want to note the significant progress we have made in continuing to strengthen the relationship with our strategic partner, NRG Yield. This partnership provides yet another significant point of differentiation between NRG and other IPPs, adding to our stable base of earnings and allowing us to replenish capital for assets we develop and drop down with strong returns.","Last quarter, we focused on strengthening our yieldco by putting in place a dedicated CEO to focus solely on growing this business. This quarter, we enter into an agreement to drop down NRG's remaining stake in CVSR. Going forward, we remain committed to finding and developing projects that we complete in the dropdown pipeline. Throughout the organization, our performance and progress in meeting our objectives has been impressive and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming months.","Andrea, we're now ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning, gentlemen. Great quarter. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Can you just give us maybe a little bit more granular detail on the strength of the \u2013 in the Generation business in the quarter because it's at odds with the performance of some of your competitors? I'm wondering whether it has to do with outage timing or other nuances going on there.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Look I mean I \u2013 as you could see on my prepared remarks, Greg, Generation business actually benefited from three main reasons. One was the hedge profile that we had and the opportunistic hedging that we've consistently done over the last couple of years. Two, we have actually focused on managing costs. We look at optimizing our maintenance CapEx, our outages and we're trying to be consistent with the way the portfolio is running today which is not the same way the portfolio ran before. So, we need to adjust our operating philosophy.","And then last one, I think we also benefited from capacity revenues coming from our South Central region, where in the past, we've said that we were able to move some megawatts into the PJM capacity auction. And so those are the three big drivers on the Generation business, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Second question, on your slide 6, you show that the market conditions have improved demonstrably in ERCOT, and some investors are frustrated that despite the gas price move, we haven't seen a commensurate move up in power prices on PJM.","I put that to sort of the way the dispatch curve looks and you're kind of in the deep part of the smile now where gas has to keep moving up for gas plants to move back ahead of coal, but there's also a theory that coal was burning out of dispatch and that's been putting pressure on power prices in that market. And that now that that's no longer happening, we might see better conditions. Can you comment on whether either or both of those are true? And if not, what's your outlook for PJM power prices?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, I mean, I've heard the frustration about moving gas prices up and power not following through. I think what I wanted to represent in this slide is that in Texas, it's actually \u2013 we have seen dark spreads move significantly both in terms of heat rate expansion and following natural gas. With respect to PJM, I think the story's slightly different.","If you look at gas basis in PJM, have actually significantly decreased over the summer. And I think that is putting some pressure on the spark spreads. I am not of the theory that coal generators are running uneconomically in the region. I just think that you're seeing an influx of combined cycles, you're seeing pretty good gas prices or low gas prices compared to the forward markets a couple of months ago. And I think the combination of those two are just putting some pressure on the spark equivalent.","On a long-term basis, as the market implemented capacity performance standards and we're seeing this massive turnover between coal and natural gas. We should expect more pressure on spark spreads. I mean the capacity performance market was designed to ensure that generators have more availability during scarcity conditions. So as we look past 2017, and towards the end of the decade, I expect to have more pressure on the spark spread in PJM and be more constructive on capacity prices. I mean that's why we shifted the strategy in the East, particular in PJM, towards becoming a capacity resource as opposed to providing energy.","We still maintain that option on energy and it's a cheap option, but most of the investments that we have made are on the back of what we think is a more constructive part of the market which is the capacity one.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Two questions. One shorter term, one longer term. First of all, shorter term, you reported and congrats on this, what looks like to be a really healthy, really strong second quarter and yet, you left 2016 guidance intact rather than raised. Just curious, what are some of the headwinds you see for the second half of 2016 that make you keep guidance at the current level?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Michael. Look, as I indicated, I think we're tracking towards the upper end of the guidance. I mean, it is the second quarter. We have a lot of the summer ahead of us and I think it's just prudent to keep our guidance the way we had it. We're very comfortable with the position that we have, we're very comfortable with the hedging that we have for balance of the year.","But let's keep in mind that we still have August and September which can be really hot in Texas. And I think it was \u2013 it's just \u2013 from a prudency standpoint, we felt that it was the right thing to do to maintain our guidance.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And thinking longer term, I mean if you just look at the company's portfolio, if there's a scenario where you're no longer the principal of \u2013 owner of GenOn, how does the board think about the market positioning of NRG \u2013 legacy NRG in terms of markets you have significant exposure to like ERCOT and then markets maybe in a next GenOn world like PJM where you'd have pretty limited exposure?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, Michael, we're venturing here in the realm of the possible and what I will tell you is that in PJM, we have actually two ways of participating in that market. Clearly through the GenOn entity but also our Midwest Generation portfolio that we acquired from Edison Mission and that's close to 4,000 megawatts. So it's not necessarily an inconsequential position. Actually in many places, you have the scale and the scope.","So, when we think about the portfolio, even without in the possibility of not having the GenOn entity, we feel very comfortable with the geographic diversification that we have across \u2013 in all competitive markets, including PJM. And just keep in mind that in the latest auction, actually the ComEd area where our Midwest Gen portfolio sits was probably the one that was the most constructive in the capacity auction results.","So, clearly, we will re-evaluate the makeup of our portfolio, but I think that doesn't necessarily changes the underlying value proposition of an integrated platform with diversity across fuel, merit order, and geographic location, and with a focus towards the more stable part of our business which is contracted assets through our renewable development portfolio and our partnership with Yield, our capacity focus, and our Retail business. So, I don't think it changes the value proposition for NRG or our strategy going forward.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Mauricio. I'll hop back in the queue.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. How are you?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, I wanted to ask a quick question real quickly around the Texas outlook. Obviously, things are evolving in that space and I wanted to get a sense real quickly as to what your thoughts are both as to retirements of not just coal assets but further steam assets and gas assets, more broadly, as well as the potential for any kind of settlement as it relates to the haze regulations with the EPA and how that might ultimately play out.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Julien, I mean, I've said it before. I think the Texas market continues to be one of the most effective markets in the country, particularly from where we're starting. If you look at the spark spreads, if you look at power prices, they were completely oversold the last couple of months. And that basically shifted some of the bullishness that we have in that respective market.","When you look at the fundamental there, even the first half of the year, we have very, very strong growth, and if I'm not mistaken, yesterday, we set a new all-time record in Texas. So, load growth continues; load growth is very robust. We like the market structure. We like the higher price cuts. I think there are improvements that need to happen, particularly on ORDC and to make sure that we have better price signals when we enter into scarcity conditions.","And as you mentioned, I mean I think there is a risk for rationalization in supply, in retirements. My expectation is that, if we continue to see this current level of pricing, there are some old steam units and perhaps some environmentally uncontrolled coal plants, that will retire because they are not going to be able to make the math work when putting back in controls.","Look, I mean I don't want to be myopic in terms of the regional haze and what will happen, and it stayed and we're going to go through the process. But behind the regional haze, you have the ELG. You have the 1-hour SO2. I mean you have a number of other environmental regulations. I think ultimately, smaller or medium sized coal units that are not controlled or well controlled, the outlook is just not going to look very promising. And perhaps it delays the retirement decision one or two years, but I think, ultimately, people will make the right economic decision. And the low gas price environment and the low spark spread environment accelerated some of that.","I mean, we actually filed to mothball one of our old steamers. It was needed for reliability. Other generators have done the same. I think you're going to continue to see that in the coming years if something doesn't drastically change in the market. But we're starting to see some recovery, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","But just to be specific here, I mean, do you see a potential for a settlement with EPA, a universal \u2013 either with the haze or more broadly?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, it's very difficult to speculate a settlement on haze with the EPA. I mean, as I said, I mean, I think there is a number of other environmental regulations that will be limiting. And even under the regional haze, you have other parts of that regulation that's still applicable in the region. So my view and my take is perhaps a little bit more generic that environmental regulations are going to be more stringent. And if you don't have good backend controls or you're in a good location or you're actually burning a lower sulfur coal, that \u2013 making the math work will be difficult.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. And then just a follow-up, in terms of GenOn, and I know this is kind of a little bit off the reservation, but in terms of just your ability to deal with any allocated costs, in the eventuality that something does happen there, how are you feeling about your ability to mitigate those costs? Now, I don't know if that's too far astray or not, but obviously last time you made a comment, how are you feeling about your efforts now to re-evaluate your cost structure and potentially mitigate the allocated costs, if it truly does come to it?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, Julien, I mean, I don't want to speculate on how we're going to be allocating cost and any potential outcomes. I mean, I think what I said about the GenOn situation is that, it's early. We are in active dialogue \u2013 or GenOn is in active dialogue with their creditors.","I've laid out kind of the three principles that we're going to apply as we navigate through this process, simplifying the capital structure. And we are maximizing value and ensuring that we don't impact negatively the credit metrics of NRG.","And as we go through this process, we're going to be using these three principles to make sure that we make the right economic decision. So, I mean, beyond that, Julien, it's really just \u2013 speculating is probably not the prudent thing to do as we go through this process right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Abe.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","On slide 13, most of these 2016 strategic priorities have been accomplished already. What are some of your strategic priorities for the second half beyond the GenOn restructuring, and do you have any further opportunities to pursue asset sales or dropdowns?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look. I mean, I'm very pleased with the progress that we have made on all the priorities, and that has afforded us the opportunity to be looking at some other strategic objectives clearly accelerating the GenOn discussion is one, but in a more general theme, I'm looking at \u2013 continue to perfect the integrated platform that we have. And that goes from the Generation portfolio to Renewables, to our Retail, whether it's residential or C&I. I am evaluating what parts of the value proposition that we have need to be strengthened and which opportunities are available in these four core businesses that we have.","So, beyond just giving you more specifics, what I will tell you is that perhaps we're pivoting weaker towards looking at other strategic opportunities as we have made such a good progress on the deleveraging front.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And perhaps similarly with the reduction in debt you have in place for 2016 and the reserves for the 2018 maturities, will 2017 capital be more focused on shareholder return or growth capital or...","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think that's fair. When I think about capital allocation, I made the case that we needed to focus on deleveraging that was the right thing to do given where we were on the commodity cycle. As we are getting now significantly below our 4.25 target, we can start focusing on returning capital to shareholders or some other growth investments. So, as I said, it's been good progress and perhaps a little ahead of schedule that we can actually turn our attention into that. But for 2016, most of the capital is committed. For 2017, certainly we will evaluate the other two options that we have.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. So first question was on GenOn, I just wanted to \u2013 and building on, I guess, a previous question. I just wanted to confirm and understand, how strong is the ring fence? As in, is there any risk that the GenOn credit or creditors have any claim at the NRG level or is the ring fence tight enough that those two boxes will be completely independent?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Look, I mean I feel very comfortable with the ring fence around GenOn. We have made the right operational decisions to position the portfolio to benefit from market trends at PJM. All the cash within the GenOn entity has remained in GenOn even inclusive of the asset sales which from my perspective were done very opportunistically, and at the right time, and at very good multiples. So from my perspective, the integrity of that entity is pretty strong. But, Kirk, do you have anything to add there?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think you summarized it well. I mean, at the outset of the transaction when we closed it, we announced we restructured it for a myriad of reasons as an excluded project sub on a non-recourse basis. And from a governance, operational, and financial perspective, we have adhered to all principles around that.","So that, I would just echo that contributes to our confidence that we've established what's necessary to ensure from a financial standpoint and from a non-recourse standpoint, it is consistent with the objectives that we set out and we operated it, both financially and operationally, in line with those principles.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And secondly, in terms of the sensitivity to gas prices, just wanted to understand how Retail fits into the Generation side. And it's interesting, you clearly have Retail performing well and at low gas prices clearly it benefits. But then I wanted to understand, as gas prices go up, as you show in these sensitivities, what is the assumption around what happens to the Retail business, EBITDA and margins, under those situations?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, I mean when you think about the Retail book, just \u2013 our fixed price obligations on Retail don't extend beyond 6 to 12 months. And for the most part, they're hedged. They're hedged to expected lows, plus some variability around weather and different weather scenarios. We buy options to manage that variability.","So if \u2013 in the short term, if gas prices increase, it doesn't necessarily impact our Retail business. I think in the long term, we have the opportunity to price low at the current market prices. So, it's further mitigated by that. I think where you'll see the difference is just in terms of the cycle around Retail in a low commodity priced environment where you have higher loads, then you can benefit from that because I guess on the margin on megawatt, you have expansion on margins.","That situation doesn't necessarily happen in higher gas prices, particularly in the short term. Again, longer term, you always price at market, so you don't necessarily \u2013 our Retail business is not necessarily impacted by it.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey. Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Mauricio, given the fact that the next big or the next maturity at GenOn is in 2017, for those of us looking at it from the outside, is it fair to say that whatever resolution you like to achieve most likely happens next year as we get closer to maturity and minds are more fixated on getting something done or might something actually play out this year?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, I mean, it's hard to say. I mean, this requires a number of stakeholders in the process. Certainly, the next summer is the first maturity that we have, the 2017s. From my perspective, we're trying to have a comprehensive long-term solution for GenOn. And that just resonates with one of the principles that I outlined, which is simplifying the capital structure or simplifying the message and the organization at the NRG level. So I'm looking at finding a long-term comprehensive solution and not necessarily just dealing with one specific maturity or not.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then secondly, then just from again a big picture perspective, when you look at your new sort of cost profile given the actions you've taken, you've identified, and you couple that with your contract and capacity profile that you laid out for us, as well as the forward curves as they stand, are we still looking at a scenario directionally that implies downward pressure on 2017 EBITDA versus 2016 or can that be now mitigated with the cost actions you've taken?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look. I mean, I'm not going to venture into providing guidance for 2017 or any indication. I think what I can tell you is that our CapEx program gets reduced by $650 million. And starting in 2017, I said it before, we're going to harvest some of the investments that we have made over the past two to three years to reposition the portfolio.","So I think that combined with, as you said, some of the cost actions that we have taken in terms of streamlining of the organization, reducing costs, resizing and recalibrating businesses that were underperforming, so I think the combination of that, plus the outlook that we've had on 2017, particularly around natural gas, which is starting to play out, I think when you combine that, it starts giving you at least some direction what some of the levers and the drivers are.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. And just one quick follow-up. The assets that you've sold, the $563 million in proceeds, can you just remind us the annual EBITDA that goes with those asset sales?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Interim President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I am not sure that we've disclosed that, but if we have, we'll follow up with you. What I will tell you is that all the asset sales that we did, one, were non-core assets; two, they were done at pretty strong multiples compared to the EBITDA, and I think, three, capitalized actually in some of the particular outcomes on the capacity auctions and energy market.","So we were \u2013 I was very pleased with the execution. It exceeded our initial target. And I think for now, we're going to pause. I mean, I don't think there is any additional asset sales that we need to do but I don't believe we have disclosed that EBITDA number.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Ayesha. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's first quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning's call will be 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts.","As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statement made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspectives. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially.

Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","Before we begin today, I want to take a moment to thank those who participated in our Analyst Day just about a month ago. It was a pleasure to share our story and value proposition with so many of you. It is an exciting time for our company, and I am confident that our path forward will create value for all of our stakeholders.","So now turning to slide 3, I'd like to start by highlighting the three key messages for today's presentation. First, we are reporting strong financial results for the first quarter, up 43% from last year, while continuing to make good progress on our Transformation Plan objectives. Second, our integrated platform is well positioned for upside in our markets today and well into the future. This includes our position going into the summer in ERCOT. And, third, as we committed to you, we held an Analyst Day in March where we outlined our long-term strategic vision and plan and the significant excess cash we will be able to generate in the coming years.","Moving to slide 4, let me review the financial and operational results for the quarter. We have again achieved top decile safety performance. I want to thank my colleagues for keeping safety a top priority, particularly as we continue to execute on asset sales and cost savings. We are reporting first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $549 million and maintaining our full-year guidance of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Our first quarter result is 43% higher than it was last year, primarily driven by cost savings and higher prices due to cold weather in Texas and the Northeast.","Also during the quarter, we continued to execute on all parts of our Transformation Plan. We remain on track to achieve our EBITDA-accretive targets of $590 million in cost savings and $215 million in margin enhancements. Regulatory approvals for our announced asset sales are progressing well, and we expect to close these transactions in the second half of 2018.","Additionally, our XOOM Energy acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of this year. Our share buyback program is also underway. Through the end of the first quarter, we executed $93 million of share repurchases towards our $1 billion program.","On the next two slides, I want to review some of the highlights from our Analyst Day, starting with the steps we're taking to strengthen our business on slide 5. Our focus is on building a business that can create value today and into the future. We achieve this by being well-positioned in attractive markets and by providing stable and predictable earnings. Given market trends, the winning platform is increasingly customer driven.","This is not just an attractive but an actionable opportunity for NRG. Our core competencies have always been generating electricity and selling it to retail customers. We have unique advantages in this space and can leverage our existing strength to redefine our business and focus on meeting customer demands.","Our evolution has led us to right-size our generation fleet, as shown on the left side of the slide. We are now much better balanced between expected economic generation and retail load. But importantly, we maintain additional capacity, and while today it is not economic at current prices, it can serve as a backstop to our retail business during periods of high prices. Now by becoming better balanced, we increased the predictability of our earnings, while still maintaining attractive market opportunities. We have a scalable retail business with stable margins that will now represent about 60% of our EBITDA and a generation business that is well positioned for a market recovery.","Moreover, the low capital intensity of our retail business combined with efficiencies in maintenance CapEx across the fleet enables us to convert almost $0.70 of every dollar of EBITDA to cash flow. The right side of the page is an illustration of our platform, stability and off-site. As you can see, our retail earnings are fairly stable whether prices go up or down, especially when you're out. Our generation business is more directly correlated to power prices and margins increase with rising power prices and decrease with falling prices. But they don't go all the way to zero because our generation is needed today. We will be compensated either through market prices or reliability payments.","So when you combine these two businesses you get the pink line on the chart, an integrated platform with little margin downside and asymmetric upside. And this profile only improves as the portfolio becomes better balanced.","Now turning to slide 6 with an overview of the financial priorities discussed at our Analyst Day. Starting on the left side with the details of our $215 million margin enhancement program; we remain on track to achieve our target and 2018 is critical in setting the foundation to achieve more significant increases in 2019 and 2020.","The lion's share of our targets comes from our retail mass business through two types of initiatives, value expansion and customer growth. Value expansion includes things like improving our platform, increasing retention and adding products to our current offering. Customer growth focuses on our sales channels and the digital experience. Now to support these and all of our margin enhancement efforts, we're investing $75 million of cost to achieve in our business.","On the right, we highlight our capital plan, which, first and foremost, supports running our business at the highest level of safety and operational performance. After these, we are focused on executing our plan to create $8 billion of excess cash by 2022, the result of our predictable earnings, Transformation Plan impacts, and some modest growth in our retail business.","As we look to allocate this cash, our decision making will follow our stated capital allocation principles. Because we are on track to achieve 3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of this year, we have started to turn our attention to reinvesting in the business at\/or above our target hurdle rate and returning capital to our shareholders. These efforts have already started with the acquisition of XOOM and the announcement of our $1 billion share buyback.","So, before I leave our Analyst Day discussion, I want to summarize this conversation by putting in perspective just how much cash our strengthened platform can generate. For purely illustrative purposes, if we were to put our excess cash through 2022 into reinvestment at our target hurdle rate, it would more than double our free cash flow before growth from $1 billion today to $2.6 billion in 2022. Now, if we were to put our $8 billion of excess cash into share buybacks, we would be buying back 80% of our market cap today. I don't believe there are many businesses with this sort of financial flexibility, and we are fully committed to being excellent stewards of your capital as we continue to evolve and execute our plan.","Now, moving to our markets, I'm starting with ERCOT on slide 7. Over the past few years, we highlighted the significant risk of retirements and the slowdown in new build, given persistent low power prices. Last year, we finally saw the retirement of about 4,200 megawatts of uneconomic coal generation, which tightened reserve margins. As a result, we are entering this summer with the lowest reserve margin on record at around 10%. Prices have responded accordingly with summer on-peak prices currently trading at about $150 per megawatt hour.","Moving to the right side of the slide, our generation portfolio in ERCOT is well-positioned and leaning long for the balance of 2018, with only 74% of expected generation hedged. On the retail side, we are a little over 100% hedged against our contracted or priced-load for the balance of 2018. For this summer specifically, I feel very good about our position and the steps that we have taken to ensure our business is well-positioned for high prices.","So, first, let's talk about our generation fleet. We are leaning long going into the summer. We have worked hard this spring outage season to ensure our units can withstand increased run times, given the expectation of high prices. And we have purchased outage insurance to mitigate the impact of unplanned outages.","Second, our retail business, and as a matter of policy, is fully hedged against our priced-retail load. This is made up of not only internal hedges where we cross generation and retail, but also by market purchases. And as we have done in the past, we have purchased out of the money options to manage against high loads and high price conditions.","Finally, we are working proactively to educate our customers and provide them with options and tools to manage their energy bills. I am very comfortable with the steps we have taken to strengthen and position our integrated business to benefit from upside this summer should prices materialize.","So now turning to the east on slide 8; the PJM capacity auction for planning year 2021-2022 will be held later this month, and I wanted to briefly provide a few observations. Last auction saw a slowdown in new bills and over 7 gigawatts of announced retirements added to the PJM deactivation list this year. But there is still uncertainty on how these will play out in terms of market tightening. As you are aware, some generators are seeking compensation for plants that are not needed for reliability and not economically viable.","While some entities are grasping a bailout in the short run, we see capacity rationalization as a necessary first step towards a healthy market. And we are confident that there will be continued support for the competitive market value proposition. Beyond PJM, our risk portfolio is well positioned given our fuel diversity and location near low pockets.","We remain optimistic about the continued calls to action for pricing reform across markets, and we will continue our work with regulators and stakeholders to maintain the integrity and well-functioning of competitive markets.","With that I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary you'll find on slide 10, first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $549 million, which is a $164 million improvement over the first quarter of last year. Generation renewables delivered $172 million in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Our retail and yield contributed $188 million and $189 million respectively.","Our strong first quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices and retail load in Texas. Those results were further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization, as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan. Although first quarter results were strong and summer prices in ERCOT remain robust, given we're still only a few months into 2018 with the summer still ahead of us, we're maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow.","During the first quarter, NRG successfully re-priced our $1.9 billion term loan, reducing the LIBOR spread by 50 basis points to $175 million over, which will generate annual cash savings of approximately $9 million. Additionally, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, we've also entered into an agreement with a third party to sell our Canal 3 project, a transaction which will enhance 2018 capital available for allocation by approximately $130 million. And shortly after Analyst Day, we also completed the sale of Buckthorn Solar to NRG Yield, closing the first of several Transformation Plan asset sales we had announced in early February. And finally, we made good progress in the quarter on our share repurchase program, which was launched in early March following our earnings call and the subsequent announcement of changes to our board of directors.","Through the first quarter, we exsiccated approximately $93 million of the $500 million share repurchase program at an average price of $29.75.","We continue to actively repurchase shares in the market, and we'll provide an update on our progress on our second quarter call. We will also update intended timing for the second $500 million installment of share repurchases once we have closed a more substantial portion of the asset sales we had announced last February.","Turning to slide 11, our expected 2018 NRG-level capital allocation is unchanged from the update we provided at Analyst Day. As a brief reminder, our 2018 remaining capital available taking into account both midpoint free cash flow and asset sale proceeds to net of previously-announced commitments including share repurchases, that remaining balance still stands at $668 million. And as I highlighted at Analyst Day, this amount is $55 million higher than our fourth quarter update as the pending sale of Canal 3 as well as the reduction in our cash reserve to ensure we hit our credit ratio target more than offset the $210 million we allocated towards the purchase of XOOM.","Finally, on slide 12, taking into account the pro forma EBITDA impact of the XOOM acquisition and including both our minimum cash of $500 million as well as the revised 2018 debt reserve of $1.065 billion, we remain on track to achieve our target 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of 2018.","Turning to a pro forma 2020 view of our ratios based on midpoint 2018 guidance and including the incremental contribution of $275 million in EBITDA from Transformation Plan savings and margin enhancements beyond 2018, we are also on track to maintain that target ratio through 2020. The combination of both the $275 million in additional Transformation Plan EBITDA and the elimination of adjustments for Midwest Generation, which are associated currently with the capacity monetization transaction, allows us to maintain that target ratio in 2020 without the need for additional cash reserve to do so.","Beyond 2018, we expect that $1.065 billion in temporary cash reserve to be completely released. With that cash in turn being available for reinvestment or additional capital return to our shareholders. In the lower right of the slide, our pro forma 2020 excess cash including that release of the reserve and the ongoing robust free cash flow is over $4.3 billion.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kirk. Now, turning to slide 14, I want to provide you with a few closing thoughts on our 2018 priorities and expectations. We remain focused on delivering on our Transformation Plan objectives. We are making good progress on completing our announced asset sales, and I look forward to providing you with updates relating to these transactions as we move into the second half of the year. We also continue to move closer to the final resolution of GenOn, which is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in 2018.","And finally, our Analyst Day provided a longer-term strategic discussion of our business. Our path forward will generate significant excess cash by leveraging our strengths, capitalizing on market trends and making execution of our Transformation Plan our number one priority.","So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Ayesha, we're now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, congratulations.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Julien. Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. So, perhaps just to kick it off, let's focus on ERCOT, seeing that where on the press this is summer here. Can you give us a little bit more commentary on how you think about your sensitivity? I know you released some kind of generic ones in the appendix here, but can you talk a little bit more about how you think about the potential upside in the 2018? You haven't updated that for a little bit here. You also cautioned that you're purchasing insurance and other things. I mean, should we think about the sensitivities here for 2018 as being fairly linear or is there sort of a capping out with collars and things like that?","And then maybe a second question, at the same time, I'll throw it to you is, can you talk about the backwardation in the curve in 2019 and 2020 and just what you're seeing out there in terms of trends of new supply? Clearly, in recent weeks, we've seen some unmothballing of assets and things like that, so to be curious for an update.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Sure. Well, let me tackle the first one and then I'll turn it over to Chris. So, there's a few things that we did this time around on the earnings slides. The first is we provided you a position report specifically for Texas, which in the past we haven't done and we wanted to do that. So, people would at least have a view in terms of for balance of the year how we're positioned. Obviously, for competitive reasons, we cannot provide a breakdown month-by-month.","Now, what we \u2013 like I said in the call, I mean, I feel very comfortable because we're actually going into the summer long. I'm not going to tell you how much, but we are. And we have complemented that with other things like additional insurance for any operational risk that we have. As a matter of fact, we have done that before. It has worked out very well for us and we just continue to do that going forward.","The second thing is we provided also the sensitivities on the appendix and a change in terms of prices from where we set the guidance and where the market is today. I think if you use the sensitivities and our open position, you will get very close to where we actually at least expected prices will be paid. Obviously, we have to see how the summer plays out. Hopefully, with these two additional elements, you can at least have an idea of where, I would say, on a mark-to-market we would look like. But obviously, we have to wait for how things develop in Texas.","Now, to your second question about the backwardation on the curve, Chris?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. It's obviously backwardated with $150 for this summer and then a $125-ish for 2019. Quite frankly, I still think 2019 has room to come up and we're pretty well set up for that with plenty of open space out in 2019 still. When the final CERA came out a couple of days ago, it did show things were 500 megawatts better than we thought, to your point mostly because of a couple of units that came back, Barney Davis was one. That was around 300 megawatts. Gibbons Creek I think was always in the numbers or at least was no surprise to the market that one was expected to come back. So, there was a little bit of move there for this summer.","Interestingly though, if you go look at 2019, the reserve margin actually went down some. It was 11.7% I think in the last CERA and this CDR came out at about 11%. What they did there was they actually reduced load by 500 megawatts, and then actually reduced generation by 1,000 megawatts. So it's kind of going the wrong direction for them in 2019 with some of these assets (25:51), for instance, actually pushing back three years from 2019 to 2022, I think, was the was the most recent number there.","So, we have to see how that works. I mean, obviously, part of the issue with the backwardation is going to impact that new build situation. I mean, we don't think at this point that it's high enough or long enough to incent new build, and we're hoping that the irrational new build is a thing of the past.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. And I think just if you look at our position for 2019 and 2020, we're pretty open.","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Very open.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","And we expect that backwardation will correct itself. Obviously, everybody is waiting to see how this summer plays out. But fundamentally, we believe 2019 and 2020 to have a lot more room, and we're well positioned for that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And then just a quick little detail here on the structure of the buyback program. Just curious, the amount purchased of late just versus the target, you're still firmly committed to executing against the full number by the end of the year?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, Julien. I mean, my expectation is that we will be executing the $1 billion by end of 2018.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Abe. Good morning.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Shifting to the cost cuts, is the $80 million that you did in Q1, is that all recurring? So will that just translate to $320 million by the end of the year? And then just a follow-up to that is where do you expect the balance of the cost cuts to come from?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So, the first \u2013 yeah, the $80 million is recurring. I think you were extrapolating that and multiplying by four. I think that's incorrect. I mean, we're going to see a ramp-up on cost savings as we go into the second and third quarter particularly, as you know, we have more clarity and visibility on the asset sales processes, and we continue to streamline the organization. So, I think what you should expect is a ramp-up as we go into Q2, Q3 and the end of the year, I mean. So, that's what I would caution you not to extrapolate the $80 million as you did.","And then what was your last question?","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That was the \u2013 you answered both of them with that. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Okay, great.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. If your phone is on mute, please unmute it. Our next question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","A couple of my key questions were answered. The first one is \u2013 that hasn't been answered is looking at the performance of the retail segment in the quarter. It looks like you guys did phenomenally well in terms of not just EBITDA, but in terms of adding customer counts, but you're not necessarily counting that towards your sort of margin enhancement initiatives, right? That's coming from just underlying organic tailwinds. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. So, let me start and then I'll turn it over to Elizabeth. I mean, first, I think the result of Q1 is it was driven by the cost savings. I mean, you're starting to see the benefit of our cost savings initiative. Number two, if you'll remember, we had a very cold January, loads were pretty healthy in Texas and the Northeast. And so that basically drove two things; higher usage and in combination with cost savings, we were able to put these numbers for retail.","Now, Elizabeth, I don't know if you have any additional comments or color in terms of the customer.","Elizabeth R. Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Thank you, Mauricio, and thank you for the question. What I would say is the results for the first quarter versus first quarter last year, Mauricio touched on, they're split pretty evenly between lower operating cost, increased margin, and weather. And if you look at that and you think about, well, why is that not showing up in the margin enhancement for the program, it's because those numbers are net of operating expenses.","So, we're making those investments. We are seeing increases in gross margin from some of the activities, but we're counting Transformation results on a net basis, not a gross basis. So, you'll continue to see that. And you're right on it being a large portion of the underlying engine that's creating that. And year-over-year, we have just over 45,000 customer count increase versus first quarter last year and also a couple of thousand in customer count growth just between year-end and now.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Kirk, any chance you can give us an insight into how many shares you've repurchased since the books closed on the quarter?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Greg, all I will tell you is that we're continuing to execute on buyback since the quarter end, and we're pleased with the progress, moving along nicely. That's all the level of detail that I'm going to share at this stage, but we'll certainly update when we get to the second quarter call.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you. Last question, you indicated in the release that part of the first quarter revenue result in the generation business was sale of NOx credits. Can you just tell us how much that was and whether we should consider that sort of a one-off or whether that's something that could be more built into a periodic ability to make ongoing sales?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Sure. Directionally, what I'd tell you is I think you probably find this in the details in our press release around the Gulf Coast region. I think we had a $57 million quarter-over-quarter increase and I'd think about that as being roughly 60%\/40% NOx credits versus prices.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah, we had...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Sorry. Go ahead.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","No. I was just going to say that we've got a decent bank of those and while we don't have a staged programmatic program to roll those out. When we when we see good numbers, we may move some from here and there.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mauricio, a question on Texas, there's the old adage that the best cure for high prices are high prices. Just curious what your level of concern is regarding the price moves incentivizing new forms of generation and that doesn't necessarily have to be peaking or combined cycle gas. It could be significantly more than expected amounts of utility scale solar end of the market.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Okay. So, Michael, I mean, your question is the, what kind of pricing we need to see to incentivize new capital going into the market. I'm just trying to understand what...","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. I'm trying to get your view on whether you see an increase or a ramp in activity related to either new gas-fired generation coming back into Texas or significantly more amounts of utility scale solar coming to supply that high peak price?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Okay, got it. Well, I mean, the first thing is we need to see not only high prices to incentivize new capital going into the market but also, not only high prices but long enough so people feel comfortable making 20 year, 25 year investment decisions. So far, what we have seen is only the expectation on one summer of high prices and we just talked about the backwardation that exists in the curve in 2019. So what we need to see in an energy-only market, price is everything. It provides the right signal and incentive for developers and companies to start putting capital to work in that market.","So, you need to see two things, you need to see them high enough and you need to see them long enough to attract this capital investment. Now, we are not seeing actually the contrary and we've been talking about it, the slowdown on new generation is very real and you can still see it in the latest CDR or CERA report that Texas put out. And I think Chris already mentioned some of these units are being pushed out one or two years.","With respect to other technologies, I don't see that really taking off only with one year of high prices. I mean, they basically follow the same behavior as any combined cycle. I don't see Texas putting a program of out-of-market payments to see whether it's battery storage or other technologies like that. I mean, Texas has been very clear and ERCOT has been very clear in competitive market signals in energy-only market. And we just need to make sure that we just let it work.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. One quick follow-up. Does your analytical team believe outside of the retirements in PJM that have been announced already? There is another significant wave of retirements coming assuming no incremental subsidies versus what's already been announced.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Chris?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey, Michael. This is Chris. If I remember right, I think that the amount of unclear generation in the last auction boarded on 18,000. So, I think just doing the quick math I think that leans you towards, yeah, you probably got some other units out there that are teetering on the brink.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Our next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Mauricio, in your comments, you had talked about the various puts and takes, pluses and minuses for the upcoming PJM capacity auction, ComEd and EMAAC specifically. At least when you put it all together, and I know bidding behavior obviously is impossible to map out from the outside, but generally speaking, your expectation because of the retirements that we should see some better pricing perhaps this year versus what we saw last year?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, I'm not going to speculate specifically on the pricing on the next capacity auction versus the 2021. What I will tell you and I think what we tried to put here are some of the big market drivers. Obviously, the retirements and the additional \u2013 I think we said a little over 7 gigawatts, close to 7.5 gigawatts have been added to the deactivation list. But obviously, that is uncertain because of all these out-of-market conversations that are happening today. Now, I am encouraged by seeing FERC and the different ISOs to take a very specific stance in terms of the protection of competitive markets and making sure that they don't negatively impact those markets.","Now, I don't know what's going to happen in the next auction in terms of the slowdown in new builds. All we're saying is that in the last auction, we saw almost half of the new builds that we have seen in the last three years. And if that continues well, you can see that as a perhaps as a positive catalyst along with the retirements if they happen.","On the other hand, you see obviously we just talked about state subsidies, zonal transfer and the stagnant load. So, I think you have pluses and minuses, it's very difficult, and I think at this point quite uncertain to determine the direction of where this can go. It's going to depend on the outcome of some of these out-of-market, I guess, out-of-market discussions that are happening now.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Second question, and as you laid out right now on the buyback front excluding the first $500 million. And if I heard you right, the second $500 million gets firmed up once the asset sale process starts to close as well. But in the first $500 million, just curious, is that driven the liquidity as you're seeing it? Is it driven by the way you see the price which you think is being undervalued? Just curious how the thought process is in this current buyback program.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. This is Kirk. I mean obviously on the second part of that question, certainly it's driven by what we see as an attractive price in the market. But certainly, the other half of that, your instinct is correct. We want to strike a good balance between taking advantage of that attractive price and also managing our existing liquidity, which is certainly significantly enhanced as we move forward to making good on closing those asset sales. But as you know in following the company, the early part of the year, that is our more acute liquidity need. So, this allows us to strike that balance and still have good robust access to the market to take advantage of that stock price.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And last question. As you ramp up the margin enhancement program on the retail side, is there any concern that as part of that? I mean, the stickiness of customers and your competitors obviously watching your moves, is there any concern about customer churn as this program starts to get more active going forward?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Well, I mean, I think the margin enhancement, as I've said, this is not about just increasing prices. I mean, we went through a very detailed conversation during Analyst Day on how we're enhancing our platform both in terms of sales channels, products, and digital experience, and the technology platform that we have. So, I think what you need to think about the margin enhancement is not increasing prices. I mean, it is a lot more, and it's investing significant capital on it. I mean, we are devoting close to $75 million in supporting that margin enhancement.","So, I don't expect \u2013 I don't think you should \u2013 our concern is not about increasing churn. And with respect to our competitors watching closely, we said, I mean, we're going to provide you a general view in terms of where we are going to make these investments and where we're getting the margin enhancement. But we're not going to provide what we think is competitively sensitive information or, as I said on the Analyst Day, the secret sauce of how we're going to get it. But, Elizabeth, is there anything else that you want to add on it?","Elizabeth R. Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.","The only thing I would add is our strategy is to balance EBITDA and customer count. It's not to just maximize margins, as Mauricio said, and so one of the initiatives within our program is actually to improve retention performance and ensure that customers are accepting the offers that we give them. So, there is quite a bit of work going on, and we feel like our position with competitors actually through the margin enhancement program will get even stronger than it is now.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Can you hear me?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Steve.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Now, we finally can hear you.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. All right. That was actually I just want to test that my phone is working. All set. Thank you. No. Okay. So, just on the \u2013 could you maybe just give a comment on how the asset sale program is progressing in terms of approvals and just have any issues come up? And I know you had a lot of leg work to do, particularly on the consents and such for NRG Yield. So just is your conviction higher today than where it was then when you announced that you'll get this done?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah, no. So, Steve, the approval process or processes are going very well. We're making a good progress. We have actually received now HSR approval for yield, renewables and ligand (43:22). And I mean in terms of yield, we have now received the majority consent on all of our contracts. So, we're making really good progress. I mean, if things continue like they are, my expectation is that we could potentially close on yield and renewables by September, early October. So, I know that we've been saying second half of the year, but I think if the progress that we're making today continues, I think there is an expectation that by September, October, we can we can close these transactions.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. Well, with that, I want to thank you all for your interest in NRG and I look forward to continue our conversations in the weeks and months to come.

I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Chad Plotkin, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Chad Plotkin","Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located on our website at www.nrgenergy.com. You can access the call, associated presentation material, as well as the replay of the call in the Investor Relations section of our website. This call, including the presentation and Q&A session, will be limited to no more than 45 minutes. [Operator Instructions].  Before we begin, I urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor statement provided in the presentation, which explains the risks and uncertainties associated with future events and the forward-looking statements made in today's press release and presentation material. We caution you to consider the important risk factors contained in our press release and other filings with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements in the press release and this conference call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to your host, David Crane, NRG's President and Chief Executive Officer.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Chad, and let me add my good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us on this -- our second quarter call. I'm joined, as usual, by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer, who will be presenting; as well as Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer, who will be presenting. Chris Moser, who runs commercial operations for NRG, is with us and available to answer any questions that you might have.  As we go into this call, I think that while that it may be anti-climatic compared to previous earnings calls because as everyone, I think, on the phone is aware, we did speak with everyone just 2.5 weeks ago, where in the context of announcing the pending transaction with GenOn, we gave a sense of where we would be for the second quarter. We are acutely aware that most of you on the phone were kind enough to give us your time at that point, so we don't expect -- we figure what we can give back to you here is we're going to keep this call shorter than normal, no more than 45 minutes.  One other small matter that I wanted to mention to everyone before we get into the call, which is a little bit unusual, is that I'm actually not physically with my colleagues in the Princeton office, but in fact, I'm participating in this call from Nevada, where I spent the last few days visiting our Ivanpah project under construction in the desert, about 45 miles south of Las Vegas. And since I've been down there, I am pleased to report to all of the NRG shareholders on the phone that construction is proceeding smoothly at that site. We expect to start testing the first unit in November this year, and we're on track for completion in 2013, and it is a truly impressive undertaking there. And our partners in this transaction, our ownership partners, Google and our technology partner, BrightSource and the construction company, Bechtel, are doing a fabulous job.  So let's get into this. I'm going to refer to the slide presentation that's on our website. So on Slide 4, in terms of second quarter highlights, starting financially, I think as most of you know, given the normal seasonality, the second quarter is not generally the most exciting quarter for competitive power companies or IPPs. For us, it's better than most, and this is in part due to the fact that the summer comes earlier in Texas than it does in the Northeast, United States, and also -- and that has a good result on both our wholesale and our retail business, and of course, the advantage we have over most others is the fact that we do have a particularly vibrant retail business in our second quarter results, which are listed on this page and which Kirk is going to greater detail on, shows this $539 million of EBITDA for the quarter, which rolls up to $839 million for the first half of the year. Not listed on this page is a very robust free cash flow performance for the quarter, but Kirk's going to go on that, so I don't want to steal his thunder.  We did list the retail contribution, and this is very important, obviously, in a year where I think to date in the summer, as I'm sure people are wondering about even as we get into the third quarter, we've had sort of broadly good weather, summer weather across most of the United States. We have not had the extreme weather in Texas that we had last year, and so the contribution from retail is very important and very positive.  As we mentioned 2.5 weeks ago, and we will reaffirm yet again today, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year 2012 and in a good position to reach that. We also -- again, reiterating what we talked about 2.5 weeks ago, we are giving preliminary guidance for 2013 and 2014 and per undertakings that we've made since then. Kirk's going to give a little bit more detail on how we get to those points. Obviously, this guidance in this presentation is given for the company on a standalone basis, which actually serves as a building block for what we actually expect to achieve when we successfully close the deal with GenOn at the end of the year.  I think the important thing to me about this preliminary guidance. In -- there was a lot of discussion on this in the last quarterly call is that after several years of -- in a declining low commodity price environment, with hedges wearing off, which has sort of led to declines in our full year, full company performance, is that we intend to and expect to stop that decline in terms of the range of outcomes that we expect. And this is largely, as people will see when Kirk talks about it, because the other parts of our business are coming on to support our original wholesale business.  Beyond our financial results is listed on this page very quickly. As everyone knows, we also are moving on several fronts in terms of doing things, which we think are in the great interest of our shareholders. We will be making our first dividend payment, first-ever record date, August 1, payment to be made on August 15. We increased our overall corporate liquidity position through the sale of Schkopau, which was our last remaining non-core asset in Germany. And as I mentioned, with Ivanpah, our other solar projects remain on track. And you may have seen a recent announcement that Agua Caliente is now the largest operating photovoltaic plant in the U.S. and is massively ahead of schedule.  Moving to Slide 5, which just, again, a slide which sort of depicts the strategic direction of our company in the wake of what -- of the NRG-GenOn proposed combination. I think this is well known to everyone on the phone that the combination itself is the center of our management focus, but in the context of our investor outreach over the last couple of weeks, we really didn't find any investor that had any serious question about how this fit with the strategic direction of NRG. So I'm not going to dwell upon it.  Obviously, as the -- while the strategic logic is clear and compelling, as management, what we're paid by our shareholders to do is to achieve the financial results that can come out of the combination. So we're very focused already in terms of integration planning on this $300 million of combination, synergies that we expect that we can get out of this transaction, and planning is proceeding very well for that, even though it's in the early days.  So finally, before I turn it over to Mauricio to talk about the second quarter operating performance on Page 6, we put down the approvals that we need to achieve in order to get the GenOn, again, transaction done. Again, it's early days, but the filings are proceeding on time. We haven't really come across anything or had anyone sort of raise their hand and say they see a big problem with this. And so we're very confident about the direction of this transaction and the timetable and continue to be on target for closing by the first quarter of 2013.  I look forward to answering any questions that you have later. And with that, I'll turn over the call over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning. Our integrated platform continue to perform well during the second quarter despite cooler weather across Texas and lower power prices compared to last year. Our operations group successfully brought the last remaining unit of our virtual plant in Texas out of mobile status.  On the commercial front, we kept our focus on managing the exposure in Texas this summer given the increased volatility in the market. Retail had another strong quarter, growing both customer counts and margins. Finally, our construction projects out West, both solar and conventional remain on track.  Moving onto our operational metrics on Slide 8 and starting with safety. 40 of our 51 facilities finished without a single recordable injury, giving us another quarter of top decile performance across the fleet. We are proud of our strong safety culture and continued commitment to safety excellence. And as such, I am very pleased to inform you that our Big Cajun II plant outside Baton Rogue received PPP star recognition from OSHA. This is the highest level of recognition in the program, and Big Cajun is our 10th plant in the fleet to receive this honor. I want to congratulate all our colleagues at Big Cajun for achieving this important safety milestone.  Our total generation was down 7% for the quarter compared to last year. We continue to see lower production from our coal fleet, primarily due to mild weather, low prices and additional maintenance outage days compared to last year. As we have said before, the benefit of performing these maintenance outages with little opportunity cost more than offset the negative impact on our availability metrics.  The reduction in coal generation was partially offset by higher production from our Encina plant in California, our Cottonwood combined cycle facility in South Central and the return of STP from its own plant outage.  Our GAAP portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well with a 98% starting reliability. Longer roll times this quarter reviewed the number of starts by 30%, leading to less stress on our units.  Moving onto Slide 9. NRG's retail business had another strong quarter. Year to date, our combined retail business grew by over 60,000 customers, while also increasing volumes, even with weather less favorable than the second quarter of 2011.  Furthermore, the business added new products and expanded into new geographic markets. We now have a retail presence in 12 states with over 300,000 customers buying more than 1 service from our retail business. For the quarter, margins increased slightly, driven primarily by lower supply cost. Our enhanced retail supply strategy mitigated the impact of price spike during the heat wave in late June. The result for the quarter is that we struck a balance between customer count and margin, consistent with our long-term strategy, and this strong performance enabled NRG to remain as the largest retailer in Texas.  Turning to Slide 10, I want to share a few observations on 2 of our key value drivers. Let me remind you that our generation portfolio, like any other margin, is significantly leveraged to both heat rates and natural gas prices. While our retail business provides countercyclical earnings, which we continue to realize this year, our retrenchment framework allows us to be exposed to short-term price spikes with our peaking units and more broadly, the structural commodity changes in the medium to long term.  In Texas, so far, this summer has been relatively moderate with just a few hot days at the end of June and July, but those were enough to set new peak low records for each month. While most daily prices had been low as a result of moderate temperatures, prices spiked when hot weather showed up, resulting in volatile, weak and month-ahead markets. These spikes have provided us an opportunity to hedge some of our megawatts at attractive prices while managing our operational risk.  We continue to believe the market fundamentals in Texas are very bullish. Flow growth is expected to remain robust, return margins continue to tighten and are expected to be single digit as early as 2014, and the market reforms implemented by the PUCT are a good first step towards providing the right economic signal to support new investments. But as you can see on the lower left chart, most structural improvements to the competitive market are required to achieve our ERCOT's reliability target.  Turning to natural gas. There are some initial signs that the market has started to work out the extra supply and appears on its way back to a sustainable balance. Rig counts are down more than 50% from the peak, year-on-year gas storage cost also has been cut in half, and we're seeing over 6 straight months of flat production. Gas prices have responded accordingly and have increased more than 50% over the past few months, with forward prices also firming up.  Moving on to our hedging disclosure on Slide 11. As you can see, we did not change significantly how we cash position our portfolio. In the short term, we remain well insulated from natural gas prices, and most of our exposure is to heat waves in Texas, where we believe recovery is imminent. In the medium to long term, we remain largely open; and as the market improves, we would benefit from a heat rate and a gas recovery.  Turning to coal and more specifically, transportation. We're in advanced negotiations around our Limestone coal contract, which expires at the end of this year. Our coal inventories remain manageable, and we continue to work with coal suppliers and rail companies to add flexibility into our contract.  As I mentioned to you in prior calls, we are constantly evaluating the economic viability of all our power plants, particularly those in the Northeast where capacity and energy prices have been significantly depressed and plant economics are challenged.  I am pleased to inform you that we have reached agreement with National Grid to allow 2 units of Dunkirk to continue operating until May of 2013, and our plant is very well positioned to fulfill the remaining reliability need identified through 2015. Finally, while in the short term we're pretty well hedged from gas prices, our integrated wholesale retail model and our exposure to the Texas market will provide significant upside in the very near future.  With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Thanks, Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 13. NRG has reported second quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $539 million, with $320 million from our wholesale business and $219 million from our retail platforms.  The first 6 months of 2012 adjusted EBITDA totaled $839 million, with $508 million from Wholesale and $331 million from Retail. Meanwhile, Cash flow from operations for the quarter was a robust $661 million, which helped drive free cash flow before growth of $413 million through the first half of 2012. Our first half performance also led to a $300-million improvement in liquidity since year-end 2011, which I'll review in greater detail.  Turning to capital allocation. On July 22, NRG reported its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share, which will be paid one week from today on August 15.  During the second quarter, we also made open market debt repurchases totaling $72 million, resulting in a commensurate reduction to our corporate debt.  Turning now to the guidance overview we've provided on Slide 14. As is reflected in the first column of the slide, we're maintaining our guidance for 2012 EBITDA of $1.825 billion to $2 billion and 2012 free cash flow for growth of $800 million to $1 billion. In addition, we're reaffirming the guidance ranges for 2013 and 2014 EBITDA and free cash flow before growth, which we established as part of our announcement of the GenOn transaction on July 22. Specifically, we are maintaining the guidance for standalone adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, and that's for both 2013 and 2014. And we expect free cash flow before growth of $650 million to $850 million in 2013 and $500 million to $700 million for 2014.  Free cash flow before growth in 2014 is impacted by planned environmental capital expenditures, primarily in our south central region and to modest increases in environmental spend in Texas.  As I indicated in my remarks on July 22, guidance ranges for '13 and '14 reflect our expectations for NRG on a standalone basis and exclude the accretive benefits from the pending transaction with GenOn which would be incremental to these numbers.  Finally, in order to provide some further clarity regarding our EBITDA guidance for each of these years, we've broken down the expected EBITDA contribution from our solar projects, retail and wholesale, and we expect our committed solar projects to contribute $70 million to $75 million of EBITDA in 2012. That's an increase of about $5 million over the range of expected solar EBITDA I discussed during our first quarter call, and that's reflective of the impact of accelerating the pace of the construction in our Tier 1 solar projects.  As these projects continue to reach COD, we expect our EBITDA contributions to increase to a range of $200 million to $210 million in 2013 and $320 million to $330 million in 2014.  Our retail businesses having delivered more than $330 million EBITDA through the first half of the year, despite the milder weather especially in Texas, remain on pace to contribute $625 million to $700 million in 2012. And we expect retail to deliver EBITDA of $650 million to $725 million in '13 and EBITDA of $675 million to $750 million in 2014, as we continue to reinforce our position as the leading retail provider in ERCOT, and our expansion into the Northeast delivers some additional growth.  Importantly, these retail numbers reflect our expectations for standalone growth and are prior to any additional benefits from significantly expanded Northeast generation platform resulting from the GenOn merger.  The Wholesale segment includes the addition of El Segundo, which will achieve COD in August of 2013, with 2014 benefiting from a first full year of operations at the plant.  Now turning to Slide 15, on committed growth investments. We now expect the total of $470 million of growth investments for 2012, which represents a $45-million increase over our May 3 guidance of $425 million. And this increase is primarily due to the accelerated spend on our big 3 solar projects, which, as you know, are our Agua Caliente, CVSR and Ivanpah, as well as investments in distributed generation. And for 2013 and 2014, we now expect a total of $379 million of growth investments. And actually, that's a $10-million decrease over our May 3 guidance of $389 million, and that's largely due to impact of accelerating that spend in 2012 that I spoke of a few moments ago.  Finally, turning briefly to corporate liquidity on Slide 16. Our total liquidity increased by $336 million during the quarter due to higher revolving credit facility availability partially offset by lower restricted cash balances. The increase in the revolver availability was due largely to the impact of the Agua Caliente selldown, and changes in cash and cash equivalents are primarily due to the net impact of $540 million of adjusted cash from operations, plus proceeds from the Agua selldown. And these items are offset by $448 million of capital investments, $104 million of debt payments, and that includes the $72 million of open market purchases I mentioned a few moments ago.  Our liquidity position will be further strengthened during the second half of the year by the proceeds from the sale of Schkopau received in the third quarter. And that $174 million in sales proceeds will also increase our RP basket by a commensurate amount, which when combined with the $250 million in net income for the second quarter, further enhances our ability to support our newly initiated dividend from an RP perspective.  With the additions of shares in connection with the GenOn transaction, as I mentioned on July 22, which we expect to close by the first quarter, will further expand RP capacity, eliminating any perceived constraints on capital allocation flexibility on the whole going forward - With that, I'll turn it back to David for some closing remarks.","David W. Crane","Well, thank you, Kirk. Erin, I don't -- I think everything has been said, so Erin, if you're -- we're ready for you to open the lines for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Cohen from ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just had a couple of questions. First on retail, it looks like you've had some pretty strong sequential quarter-over-quarter growth in customer numbers. Can you give us some indication of how much of that is in Texas versus some of the Northeast markets?","David W. Crane","Mauricio, do you have that information available?","Mauricio Gutierrez","David, I don't have it handy, but we can get back to you, Jon, and give you the breakdown on the growth.","David W. Crane","Jon, I mean, my rough sense is it's about equal. It's not a particularly remarkable outcome, but we will get you the exact numbers.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Mauricio, on the Northeast load, is there any rule of thumb or way to think about how much your supply cost would go down by having generation to back up load?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, I think the way we -- we've always portray the, I guess, the synergy value between wholesale and retail and ERCOT, which is what we're trying replicate in the Northeast is, one, the collateral savings that we get by costing generation alone. And then the second is just providing or being more comfortable capturing the low following premium using our retail vehicle as supposed to managing or hedging our portfolio in the wholesale market. So I would say that those are the 2 main drivers, and it is different depending on the market dynamics. But I -- specific numbers, I think it will be very difficult to tell you at this point what is the incremental value. In the past, we have provided some guidance in terms of what are those benefits in Texas, and as we continue to integrate the Northeast platform and expand our retail business in the Northeast, we'll provide you additional clarity on that.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then one question for Kirk. On Page 15, there's about $250 million or $260 million of conventional CapEx in '12 through '14. Is there an EBITDA contribution associated with whatever those investments are in your guidance of $1.8 billion?","Kirkland B. Andrews","In the $1.825 billion to $2 billion in 2012...","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm thinking more about the '14.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Okay, yes. Once you get to 2014, the bulk of those repowering projects were just -- the biggest component of that is our El Segundo project out in California, which is online in 2014. So that contributes to a full boat of EBITDA in 2014. I don't think we've provided specific guidance as to what that is. I think it's -- the best way to think about it is just a little less than $100 million on an annualized basis once it reaches run rate in 2014.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But El Segundo, I think, the remainder of the spend is going to be project financed, right, so this is -- should be other stuff as well? So I mean, I know you're thinking about expanding some plants in Texas. I was just wondering if there was any EBITDA contribution in there?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, I mean, the bulk of El Segundo or the bulk of the repowering project is El Segundo. I mean, there's some minor degree of capital expenditures around eVgo and some of the new businesses, but the lion share of the EBITDA contribution from the repowering investments comes from El Segundo.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I know I asked this question last time, but I just want to go back to it again. So you're showing us $320 million to $330 million of EBITDA contribution from solar by '14. Could you tell me what's the corresponding total debt for NRG for those projects?","David W. Crane","Kirk?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Sure. Once you get out to 2012, the total amount of -- or 2014, I should say. The total amount of debt or the total capital associated with that is about $4.3 billion. Of that number, about $3 billion of that is the total amount of solar debt.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. But what's your share? Is that $3 billion your share of debt, of the solar debt?","Kirkland B. Andrews","No, that would be on a consolidated basis.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Well, okay. So what is the NRG service portion of the solar debt?","Kirkland B. Andrews","If you go through, Ivanpah, for example, Ivanpah is about $1.5 billion in total debt. We obviously own 50.1% of that particular project. So if you were looking for an allocation of our percentage, it's about half of that. Agua Caliente is just under $1 billion worth of debt, and we own 51% of that by virtue of the transaction with MidAmerican. So you deduct basically half of those 2 components from the total.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","So roughly speaking, about to $2.1 billion of that debt would be serviced by NRG?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, I think that's probably a good number, yes.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And secondly, I know you're not trying to give us anymore insight into your retail growth prospects in PJM, but I mean, how should we think about it? I just -- David and Mauricio, I doubt that you're merging with GenOn through cost synergies only. I think that there is -- there are growth prospects embedded in the plan. And could you give us a sense of where we are now for PJM volume wise and how should we think about it volume wise, not margin wise, but volume wise going forward?","David W. Crane","Well, Mauricio, do you want to give that information?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, David. I think, at this point, we're not prepared to give information around the growth prospects in the Northeast. I think that is -- Angie, I mean, that's something that we will provide you in the coming months. What I would say and just to characterize a little bit more the growth that we have seen on our retail business, half has been in Texas. Half has been outside of Texas, particularly in the Northeast. Green Mountain, with some of the premium products, have been very effective in the Northeast markets, particularly around the mass customers, so we are very encouraged by those results. But I think you should expect from us more disclosure around our growth prospects in the Northeast. I will say that on the plans that we have provided and the forecast that we have provided today through '14, the growth assumptions that we have are pretty conservative across the retail businesses.","David W. Crane","But Angie, let me add to what Mauricio is saying because I think if there is any single thing that surprised us in terms of investor and analyst reaction to the proposed combination with GenOn is the extent to which people are interested and even excited about what this greater generation platform in the Northeast will do for us on the retail side, and we are happy with that because we agree with that. But I will tell you, as we have done the evaluation of the combination with GenOn, since the matter first came up a couple of months ago, our first focus was on the cost synergies and the other synergies that were announced 2 weeks ago. And that, the second focus was then on the synergies we could achieve with GenOn just on the generation side of the business. To be frank, no part of the evaluation that the NRG board did or NRG management did said, well, wow, if we own all those other megawatts in the Northeast, we can grow our Northeast retail platform at twice the speed. That's all going to be upside, and we can -- and we will be evaluating that going forward and talk to you more about that. But I would say most of our customers in the Northeast come from Energy Plus, and virtually all of Energy Plus' customers are on month-to-month basis. One of the advantages this allows us to do is they'll make it easier for Energy Plus, through their platform and our other retail platforms, to offer fixed-price contracts. And that's going to be an upside because how many more customers that will attract and the profitability of that we will -- we'll be talking about in the future. But none of that's built in into the basic application of why want to do this transaction.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mauricio, I just wondered if you can just give a little more update on what you guys are seeing in ERCOT by way of kind of coal and gas switching,, coming back with the gas price rally in both as the second quarter progressed and what you guys are seeing as we roll through July at this point?","--","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, I mean, I think, Dan, if you look at -- and we try to provide some specific examples on the earnings slides. With the gas rally, you're kind of out of the PRB switching area. You're starting to get -- getting closer to the Eastern coal markets. Particularly in Texas, I would say the combination of that and some heat rate recovery, we have seen the reversal of that coal to gas switching that we experienced in January. So I mean, that's what I would say in terms of coal to gas switching. Our expectation and Dan, keep in mind, I mean, natural gas is one component, but the heat rate then, which from our perspective there is a small relationship between heat rates and natural gas, but to a greater extent, heat rates are a function of the finest in the market. Natural gas has all the different drivers. We think that -- we don't expect that to persist, I guess, in balance of the year. And certainly, on the forward market, when you start getting into '13, '14, '15, with gas prices in the high 3s, low 4 territory, I mean, you're significantly out of the PRB switching area.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess just on ERCOT in general, obviously, the price caps you have made maybe room for some volatility in pricing but probably not enough to attract or sustain attractive and durable investment in new assets. Can just give us an update kind of on conversations you guys are having as far as alternatives are concerned and what kind of progression or what steps we should be looking for as you guys see the conversations going?","David W. Crane","Sure. I mean, I think you're right, Dan. The forward spark spreads do not incentivize new build economics. We believe that there is at least $10 per megawatt hour of off-site on the on-peak hours to start getting into that new build economics. And these are not necessarily based on very aggressive overnight cost to build. I mean, I think the range that we have provided is $800 to $1,000 per kW. In terms of the conversations that we have been having with ERCOT and the PUCT is we want to see a well-functioning, competitive market that provides the reliability that the state requires. And I think the Brattle report was very clear that even with the steps that the PUCT have taken in terms of price caps or floor prices on reserves, there is still a gap to incentivize those new builds. And that missing money has to come from somewhere else, whether it's a capacity market or some other form or type of resource adequacy program. And from our perspective, it's going to be -- there's going to be a lot of conversations around that topic. I think a lot of the constituents are recognized that price caps will not get you to the target reserve margin, that you need something else. And over the next couple of weeks, through the ERCOT workshops, I think we're going to be discussing that with other constituents. But I think the -- everybody recognizes that there's got to be something else done to be able to incentivize those new build economics.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Mauricio, you think about kind of the timeline between the workshops and people trying to build toward a consensus or something else? What do you think is the realistic conversion from some sort of conclusion here to an new implementation and how it could affect the power markets from a tangible monetary perspective?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Look, I mean, if you take the -- your reserve margin as your barometer on how tightly supply and demand, I mean, you're seeing in 2014, basically, single-digit reserve margins, significantly below the 13.75% target from ERCOT. So I think the timeline, I think, in the next couple of months, we're going to see a pretty good conversation around what other steps need to be taken. But I mean, we would be happy to continue this conversation, Dan, in terms of the clarity and the disability that we see in the ERCOT process.","David W. Crane","Dan, if I could just add that because -- I never want to predict when government entities or quasi government entities do things. So it's best not to make a prediction on that. But in our conversations with the powers that be down there, they obviously -- as Mauricio says, they do have a sense of urgency about this. So hopefully, whatever happens, will happen in a very timely fashion.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill from Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sorry to stick with the last question, but I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on kind of the unwillingness that seems to or the trouble that policymakers are having with moving to a capacity market in Texas.","David W. Crane","Well, Gregg, I don't know if there's any magic to the words capacity markets. In California, they have the sort of the resource adequacy, and I think there's a greater sense among the policymakers in Texas. That's something -- can do a capacity market or something that has the same consequences or impact is necessary. But to be frank, we don't really care what it's called, and we don't think it needs to be exactly the same as what they have in PJM or any of the Northeast markets. As long as it's -- it works and sends the right price signal. So that's the type of dialogue we're having with them. And as Mauricio said, we've been very encouraged that there has been some dialogue with the people, the stakeholders in the market with us and we presume, with others, about how things would work and things like that. So I think the historic reluctance to go down that path as a practical manner is modifying. But I mean, I don't think that what ERCOT will end up doing is something that -- it's one day -- I don't think you need to worry that you're going to wake up one day and say, we just adopted the PJM capacity market model full stop. I don't think that's what will happen.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can -- in the last few weeks, we've gotten a fair amount of update on San Onofre out in California. Could you just comment on what is the bilateral sort of capacity market or resource adequacy outlook in California look like over the next few months to a year? Say, how has that changed? And then could you give us a bit of color on -- particularly on the Encina resource adequacy contract, which I think expires at the end of the year, when we might hear sort of re-contracting news around that?","David W. Crane","Well, I mean, yes, I don't know if Mauricio will be able to answer your second question. But he'll give the, call it, the old college try or else see you avoid it. But I mean, just for everyone on the phone, I mean, in San Onofre -- the difficulty at San Onofre has had a very significant impact on our Encina plant, the existing plant and from my perspective, the prospects for Encina going forward, since it's located in a very similar position in the grid -- and we've -- and Encina has worked, been online much more this summer. I -- actually, Brian, I'm sorry, what was the first part of your question about San Onofre and its impact on us?","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to get a sense of have you seen the resource adequacy values or contracting environment for power plant assets in Southern California tick up as a result of the difficulties in San Onofre?","David W. Crane","Well, I mean, we -- our official position, we don't comment on anything that might be pending, but I would say, there -- consistent with my remarks, there has been much greater interest in the power from Encina since San Onofre started with its difficulties. But I think we need to leave it at that -- on that specific questions. But in terms of impact on the market, Mauricio, do you want to talk about that? The resource adequacy market?","Christopher S. Moser","This is Chris Moser. I'll Jump up on that one, David, if that's all right.","David W. Crane","Yes, that's fine, Chris.","Christopher S. Moser","What we've seen so far is a lot of uncertainty on potential return days, and obviously, that really has -- I mean, what it's done is muddy the water quite a bit. I mean, it's obviously a big unit there that's missing, and no one knows when it's coming back. So really that's thrown a big cloud of uncertainty around that. So what we've seen is bid ask on the capacity or on the resource adequacy really kind of widen out. And that's about the update that we have right now. I can't say that it's tracking in one general direction because it's so wide right now because no one knows really what's going to happen out there.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Chris, could I ask what the bid ask numbers actually are?","Christopher S. Moser","I can those for you. I don't have them on the -- we're not going to -- we can go into some details another time, but I think we've got another couple of people we still need to get through. So we can chat about that in another point.  Okay, I'll follow up with offline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So firstly, not to beat a dead horse here, but on retail again, in the Mid-Atlantic, as you look at the Northeast expansion here, is it more of a C&I push? I think that's what you guys had historically articulated? Or is it more of a mass market push through Green Mountain and Energy Plus, et cetera?","David W. Crane","Well, Julien, first of all, I think that we're obviously going to be active in both. But in the absence of Jason, I would say that I don't think we actually ever have historically said it would be more of a C&I push. I think that we -- it would be -- it's either a little bit more of the retail push, although we have an active C&I capability that's working in the region and doing a good job. I mean, there's been more pressure on C&I margins than there has been on the retail side. So as we have done in Texas, we'll probably to pursue both. But since you said more C&I, I want to push back and say maybe a little bit more mass market.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then perhaps talking about some of the developments in New York, what kind of improvement do you think we could look towards in 2013 in the Northeast segment? I mean, not to provide guidance, but just getting a sense on New York. It just seems like that could be pretty material.","David W. Crane","Yes. The New York capacity markets, Mauricio, you want to talk about that?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Sure. And Julien, I -- as you know there is a -- I would say that quite a bit of uncertainty about retirement dates, people pulling in and out plants from mobile status and not, so we actually -- in general, we believe that the Northeast either because of the economics that are significantly challenged for the plants or the -- some of the environmental regulations, we believe that the capacity markets will start moving towards a constructive territory. And in terms of the timing, when that's going to happen, I think there is quite a bit of uncertainty. I mean, we saw how, I would say, digital the price can be in New York just by virtue of having one unit, announce mobile, but they're retiring and then taking a second look. So I would say that the -- I think the fundamentals are there, and it's just a matter of determining when that will happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Deutsche Bank.","Keith Stanley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'll stick to just one question given the time here. Can just provided a little more color on progress and the potential time frame for slowing down more of this solar portfolio or looking at the tax equity market? I would think as some of these projects are coming into service now more rapidly than you guys initially thought. The amount of the makers and ITC tax benefits are going to start to increase pretty rapidly. And as the second part of my question, are there any restrictions at all in place on selldowns of solar assets or accessing the tax equity market under the merger agreement?","David W. Crane","Well, Keith, I think -- let me -- I mean, the second question about -- it seemed like a 3-part question for one question. But at least the second part about the selldowns or the -- Kirk can answer those questions. But what I would say to you is from our perspective, for us, when we sold the part, Agua Caliente to MidAmerican, we demonstrated that we could sort of sell down these assets at value. I think we said at that time and continues to be the case that our testing of that market has indicated that there are many viable players that are interested in positions in these assets. But if you want to sell at maximum value with the broadest possible range of potential buyers, you need to do that as close to -- you need to eliminate the sort of tail construction risk to the fullest extent possible. So we are happy where we are for now. But as you say, with the plants coming online over the next few months, you could see more activity in that area, but -- and on the tax equity side, I mean, I think the short answer is we are looking at that market on a sort of a continuous basis to deal, to optimize the tax benefits. But Kirk, do you want to elaborate on that?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Sure. First of all, Keith, in reverse order of your questions, we have the flexibility in the merger agreement to continue to pursue selldowns especially on the larger projects. And I'll view that as a segue to answer your other question. We're certainly continuing to pursue straight selldowns along the lines of what you saw on Agua Caliente. I think if I had to predict that, that is the type of monetization you'd see more along the lines of our larger solar projects, the big 3. And we are also, in parallel, continuing to work on the tax every front, and that's more likely to be the case with respect to some of the smaller projects, for example, the remaining 6 of our Tier 1 solar portfolio. And we'd expect to provide some additional updates on that as we progress in those efforts. But we have full flexibility to pursue both of those opportunities or avenues during the patency of the merger.","David W. Crane","Well, Erin, I think we've run over our stay. So I just want to thank everyone for participating in this call. I mean, obviously, we will be back with you for our third quarter earnings call around the beginning of November. But given that we do have the GenOn merger pending and I think there'll be events, approvals and all you'll be hearing from us, and we will obviously be involved in the continuous investor outreach that we're always involved in. And any questions anyone has, please feel free to call Chad and Stefan at NRG's IR group.

Also with me is Chris Moser who runs Commercial Operations for the company and will be available to answer any specific questions you have in that regard.","So let's get right into it because as usual we have a lot to talk about today. So if you are following on the presentation, turning to Slide 3 I mean clearly we had a good first quarter. The strength of our financial performance which you anticipated has been commonly attributed to the severe weather which we experienced during the quarter no more by you out there than by we ourselves. Indeed, in the first draft of the quarterly press release I think the exceptional weather was mentioned at least eight times.","But there are lessons to be learned from the different financial outcomes experienced by the power companies active in our core markets that operated their businesses under the very same weather conditions. First and foremost of these lessons is the reaffirmation of the point that we have been making about the merchant generation business for the past decade which is that the best way to out earn your cost of capital in the IPP business is to operate and trade a base load fleet that runs on multiple fuels.","In other words, from a commodity perspective, NRG makes money by selling coal and uranium at natural gas prices. And that proposition worked very well for us in the first quarter of 2014. The atmospherics, if you will, around the first quarter weather also have tended to obscure the fact that it took an exceptional operating performance from both our plant operations folks and our commercial operations team to navigate successfully through the unprecedented technical challenges and commercial volatility that we experienced this quarter.","So first I want to express my profound gratitude to Mauricio and his entire operations team for their total dedication and magnificent performance during the quarter. NRG's success is their success. Personally, I had absolutely nothing to do with it. My role was only to sit on the sideline and to applaud. Second, I am very mindful of the fact that our customers had a difficult time of it this winter. Individual monthly energy bills this winter averaged hundreds of dollars in excess of recent winters. There is little consolation I can offer these customers in respect to this past winter but in terms of the future, I want our customers to know that NRG is moving fast to put itself in a position to offer a full range of distributed generation and comprehensive home and efficiency solutions that have the potential to meaningfully reduce people's energy bills over time.","Now turning to Slide 4. While we were very focused during the quarter on keeping the lights on for our customers and delivering a positive upside to our shareholders, it also was a very active quarter for us in terms of positioning NRG for future success. Most notably through the three strategic acquisitions which appear on this page. The biggest of the acquisitions to close was obviously the Edison Mission Energy transaction. With respect to EME's base load plans in and around Chicago, we are well into duplicating the evaluation process we used during the early post-closing stage of the GenOn integration.","As you will recall, in GenOn it took us six months to fully assess our options and only then did we announce our asset synergy plan. In the case of Midwest Gen, the good news is that we do not believe it will take us another six months to develop an articulate a fully thought out asset plan. The less good news is that it will take us more than the five weeks that we have had to date. So I promise you that as soon as we have an asset plan with respect to Midwest Gen that we are comfortable with, we will brief you on its contents and its projected financial impact on the company.","Moving to Slide 5. I would like to make one observation about the political and regulatory situation in Illinois as it affects the Midwest Gen fleet. A few weeks back at an event in Chicago, I made some comments on Exelon's public policy positions with respect to their distressed nuclear assets in Illinois. Press reports of my comments focused almost exclusively on the fact that I perceived great irony in the fact that Exelon seemed to be seeking some sort of subsidy for their existing nuclear plants, ostensibly on the grounds that nuclear is zero carbon energy, at the very same time that Exelon was actively lobbying for an end to several tax breaks for zero carbon wind and solar.","My main point that day in Chicago however was different and it's worth clarifying here today. I am not fundamentally opposed to subsidies if the primary goal of the new subsidy is to ensure that enough existing base load capacity is retained in the market to provide reliability even during severe weather events affecting the system. But in this regard I would note that our coal plants on the outskirts of Chicago can keep the lights on as well if not better than operationally inflexible nuclear plants located further away from the load center. As a result, it is our opinion that any scheme devised in the future to keep existing solid fuel fired capacity alive in Illinois as a necessary base load complement to all the wind generation coming into Illinois from the Dakotas, should treat Midwest Gen's fleet as well if not better than economically marginal nuclear plants.","What is going on in Illinois is basically a question of how do we maintain base load fuel diversity long-term across all markets in a world which is becoming increasingly carbon constrained. The obvious solution is to take the carbon out of the existing coal plants post combustion. Today I am very pleased to inform you, and this is shown on Slide 6, of Petra Nova, our carbon capture to enhanced oil recovery or CCEOR project at our giant Parish coal-fired plant outside Houston. The Petra Nova project effectively will sequester 1.6 million tons per year of carbon into nearby oil fields. In so doing, it will enable oil production that will provide the economic return we need in an environment where there is not yet a price on carbon.","Petra Nova is scheduled for financial closing and notice to proceed in just a few short weeks. Petra Nova is a win-win-win project and that\u2019s just from NRG's perspective. First it's a win for us because it provides a meaningful carbon hedge for Parish. Second, it's a win for us in that it diversifies our commodity exposure and allows us to realize our economic return from the project through the price of crude oil. And third and finally as you can tell by the map on this page, our three major coal plants on the Gulf Coast which are amongst the youngest and more important of all the coal plants in our fleet. Each sit astride oil fields that are candidates for enhanced oil recovering using CO2.","In my opinion, the ability to economically capture carbon post-combustion at these three plants is not only a potentially lucrative source of additional revenue for the company. It means that the average remaining life of these coal assets or their residual value for the (indiscernible) will be significantly greater than it was before carbon capture became a reality. We will brief you more fully about Petra Nova at the time of the deal closing, which as I said we expect later next month.","Now turning to Slide 7. We have made no secret in recent years of our belief that the future of competitive retail energy supply lay in providing a broader range of energy and energy related products and services, both inside the home and on the home. And the key to future success in retail will be to win the hearts and minds and loyalty of home-owners in all of the markets in which we participate. We have been hard at work growing our mass retail business organically. Adding net customer counts, staying top decile in customer satisfaction surveys and expanding into new markets. And importantly, becoming good and leasing and the other critical behind the scenes aspects of residential solar.","In the second quarter this year we bought Roof Diagnostics Solar which is involved all across the residential solar value chain but whose particular strength is both customer acquisition and installation. These areas of expertise are both critical points of differentiation for NRG from the perspective of turning residential solar from a primarily local business supplied largely by self-employed roofers and HVAC companies to a big, fast-growing and exciting business being performed by reputable companies like NRG which are in a better position to stand behind their performance for the long term.","We have worked with RDS as partners even before the acquisition and I am convinced that working together under one roof so to speak, we will build a top tier residential solar franchise that both will benefit and benefit from very close association with our conventional retail businesses. Our goal of course is to seamlessly offer residential solar to our three million conventional retail customers and conversely to offer system power and other energy products and services to our much smaller but very fast growing roster of residential solar customers.","Finally, on Slide 8, we are highlighting one of the most value optimizing opportunities from within the EME deal, the high quality wind asset portfolio with long-term contracts which provides yet another substantial pipeline of contracted assets eligible for drop-down to NRG Yield. We have been hard at work since the NRG Yield IPO last summer and making sure that energy yield is the highest quality vehicle of its time with the most diverse set of operating assets and an attractive growth pipeline. All these goals were amply served by the EME acquisition.","We remain convinced that the highest growth opportunity for NRG in solar, wind and other clean energy solutions is migrating from the utility scale deals that have previously been our principle focus, to the business to business and business to consumer solar markets, both of which are potentially enormous. In these markets, NRG Yield and the certainty and competitive cost of capital that it can offer for bundled portfolios of B2B and B2C deals, will be an enduring competitive advantage for NRG.","So let me conclude on Slide 9 with a bit of a situational analysis on NRG's positioning within the American Energy industry from the perspective of a potential investor in this space. I have been very open over the past several months in stating my conviction that our industry is on the cusp of disruptive change. That new energy technologies now cost effective and available to be deployed at scale will transform the traditional power sector and the vertically integrated utilities which have dominated it since the 1930s.","Every day I see developments in our business and our society that convince me that this disruptive change is now upon us and that there is no turning back. As a result, our priority internally has been to move faster and more effectively so that we can win in energy future that is going to be significantly cleaner, more distributed and less uniform than the present command and control, one size fits all system. From your perspective as investors it must be an incredibly exciting time filled with investment opportunity. Think of 50 million American homes each with a distributed solar system at $20,000 a pop on average. That represents a trillion dollar market opportunity. And certainly the valuation levels ascribed by the market to early movers in the distributed generation space indicates that the stock market recognizes the extraordinary blue sky potential of distributed generation.","But trying to invest in the market opportunity of distributed solar right now as a public company investor basically means investing in the very few pure play residential solar companies that have gone public. And that strategy is not without risks. You are betting that the early movers continues to be the market leaders even in the face of bigger companies like NRG coming into the space. You are betting that the distributed generation market has a breakout sooner rather than later and you are betting that the path to real and sustained profitability in the distributed generation space not only eventually reveals itself but reveals itself in the business of the company that you have chosen to invest.","On the far other side of the power industry sits the traditional investor-owned utilities and independent power producers. As the EEI itself correctly foretold in January last year, investors in the conventional power sector contemplating a long-term investment in the electric supply industry will soon realize that they are not being paid enough to take the risk of systemic disruption that suddenly confronts the conventional power companies. There are plenty of power companies in addition to NRG who performed well during the Polar Vortex and achieved a strong first quarter result. But what is the long-term future for companies that depend exclusively on the sale of system power delivered over an increasingly obsolete and unreliable grid to a population of consumers and businesses that more and more will be relying less and less on grid delivered power for their energy needs.","Conventional power companies should have a long-term strategy for that and as we look around the industry we just don\u2019t see it. And that leaves the field clear, at least clear of incumbent power companies for NRG. So NRG in my opinion represents a very different and increasingly unique value proposition. A proposition that is demonstrated both in terms of current financial performance as measured in the incontrovertible reality of our robust free cash flow. And the almost limitless future potential growth opportunity that distributed energy represents for us. We expect to realize on this opportunity by harnessing the reciprocal benefits of fusing our nearly 3 million retail customers, conventional retail franchise, with our emerging residential solar capability as I have mentioned before.","No one else has the platform we have in this regard and we intend to leverage our strategic advantages quickly and as completely as possible. So if you are an investor contemplating investment in this space, we hope you will consider investing in NRG, NRG Yield or both and come along on what we expect to be an exciting ride into the clean energy future.","With that I will turn it over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","David, thank you and good morning everyone. As you all know during the quarter we experienced extreme weather conditions and unprecedented price volatility in our core markets. But it was the diversity of our generation portfolio, our integrated business model, and most importantly the excellent performance from our plant operations and commercial operations teams that allowed us to deliver record financial results for the quarter. I want to thank all my colleagues for their outstanding performance. And while we are only now sharing this success with you, I want to assure you that everyone at NRG has already turned the page and we are now focused on getting ready for the summer.","The events of this past quarter brought out the best of NRG but it also helped highlight some of the shortcomings of our electric system. It is clear to us that we need to improve the coordination between power and gas markets, recognize the value of fuel diversity through competitive market signals as David pointed out, and ensure a reliable transition as we implement new environmental regulations that could lead to significant capacity retirements. We are working closely with regulators and stakeholders to continue improving our competitive markets.","Our integrated platform performed significantly well during the quarter with the wholesale business more than offsetting the challenges faced by retail, given the increased price volatility and higher loads. But the fact that we were able to sustain retail margins under these circumstances is an example of how robust our risk management capabilities are.","With all the changes that we have made in our portfolio over the past 18 months and since I know many of you have asked about the recent ruling by the Supreme Court regarding CSAPR, it seems appropriate to provide you an update on our environmental compliance plan. This is an important year for us with over $230 million of CapEx planned for this year, primarily at Big Cajun, Conemaugh and our New Jersey [peaking] (ph) assets. All of which are on-schedule and on budget. In total, we are still projecting $326 million in environmental spend over the next four years excluding any impact related to the closing of Edison Mission.","With respect to Edison Mission, we are also working diligently to optimize the existing environmental compliance planned for the Midwest Generation assets. We are applying the same optimization process used with GenOn across all the new assets not just environmental compliance, and expect the same good results in terms of operational synergies but in a much shorter timeframe. With respect to the CSAPR decision, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision that had vacated the rule and extending it back to the lower court for further proceedings. This is clearly a win for EPA but there is still a number of open issues that need to be resolved. We do not expect any significant change to our current environmental compliance plan from the resurrection of CSAPR. We anticipate the existing [care] (ph) program to remain in place for sometime while some of the legal and procedural issues are addressed.","Turning to operational performance on Slide 12. We had another quarter of top quartile safety performance with a 110 out of 121 facilities without a recordable injury. This is particularly gratifying given the severe weather conditions under which our plant operations people were exposed through during the quarter. While these results don\u2019t yet reflect our newest assets, Edison Mission has a strong safety culture and we look forward to integrating them into NRG and the opportunity to learn from each other to continue improving our program.","Solar generation was significantly higher from last year driven primarily by the east region which was up 39%. Colder weather in the east couple with gas supply constraints proved out the value of fuel diversity and optionality as we saw unprecedented dispatch in many of our units from coal to oil to gas. Right behind it but no less impressive was Texas with generation 30% above last year, driven primarily colder than normal weather and improved availability at our South Texas project plant. It is important to note that we continue to optimize our maintenance outage days during lower price periods. So that we take full advantage of the peak price opportunities such as the ones caused by the Polar Vortex.","Over the past three years, we have increased the number of maintenance outage days and believe that the benefit of getting this outage is done with little opportunity cost and increasing the reliability when it matters the most, more than offsets the negative impact on our annual availability metrics. For example, during peak price days in January and February, our coal and nuclear availability was over 90% demonstrating the value of our strategy. Coal and nuclear reliability improved 30% year-over-year to 9% for the quarter and our gas fleet also performed exceedingly well with 97% starting reliability while doubling the number of starts.","Once again, this performance was achieved under severe weather conditions. With a portfolio of over 53,000 megawatts of generation and more than 140 plants, the execution of our planned outages are critical. We have been focused on executing the 159 outages that we have planned for the spring season in order to get ready for the important summer months.","Moving on to Slide 13. We were quite pleased with the performance of our retail platform. Despite increasing wholesale prices, extreme weather and ongoing competitive pressure in the C&I segment, we delivered $108 million in adjusted EBITDA, $5 million more than the first quarter of 2013. Extreme weather conditions covered all the markets we served throughout the quarter with the Polar Vortex in the Northeast and sustained cold weather in Texas. At the same time, power prices were up between 50% and 150% year-over-year. Challenging conditions to say the least.","Through these, however, we continued to execute as we leveraged the strength of our marketing and sales channels as well as our margin management and integrated wholesale and retail capabilities. The results is that we held retail unit margins overall and increased them in Texas while growing customer count in both Texas and the Northeast. This is one of the key reasons why we felt comfortable expanding our platform even further with the closing of the Dominion retail electricity business.","This acquisition extends our leading multi-brand business in Texas and nearly doubles our Northeast customer base, enabling us to bring innovative products and services to an additional 500,000 mass customers. In the C&I segment, we continued to maintain our discipline in this intensely competitive segment and are extending our product offering to include advisory services and comprehensive solutions to our customers beyond system power, including backup generation, solar and demand response. We have now 14 consecutive quarters of customer growth, our ability to maintain margins and customers along with the overlap of our generation portfolio and our retail footprint, we are well positioned to continue expanding our franchise and extend the value of our customer relationship.","Moving to our market update on Slide 14. Overall, we are seeing some bullish signals in our markets. Unlike what we have seen in quite some time. Starting with gas and the obvious impact that this whole winter had on storage levels, we remain at 50% of the five-year average, levels not seen in a decade. Real concerns about the ability to refuel storage to a reliable level will develop unless injections begin to ramp up soon. And if we experience a hot summer, strong injections may be very difficult to incent without further increasing prices. You can see the insert chart in the upper left hand chart showing historical weekly injections and the high level that is necessary to achieve the storage number we saw in 2013 of 3.8 Bcf.","This fundamental picture and the strong pricing we saw in Q1 have affected the forward power markets. Both dark spreads and spark spreads have expanded benefitting well diversified portfolios like ours. The upcoming PJM capacity auction continues to highlight many changes that extend our bullish view. The combined effect of higher requirements and limits on demand response, the limits on capacity imports and the significant levels of un-cleared coal megawatts are positive signs in PJM.","Finally, as you know, we have not been overly bullish on the prospects of the Midwest. But COMED is becoming a growing source of opportunity for us. In fact, we think this opportunity goes beyond driving value for our proven synergy model. We have nice rally in the market over the past few months potentially signaling a state of transition in the market dynamics. Accordingly, we are looking forward to updating you in further detail over the quarters as we refine and complete our operational synergy assessment.","Moving to our hedging disclosures on Slide 15, we now have added the expected fuel and generation numbers for the Edison Mission assets and the respective impact on the sensitivity charts. As you can see, we have increased hedges in our coal and nuclear fleet for the balance of 2014, where we took advantage of the commodity rally and executed hedges against the Midwest fleet. Beyond 2014, the hedge levels have decreased slightly reflecting the open position in the Midwest. During the quarter, and despite the additional demand from this [cold] [ph] winter, our commercial team remained focused on integrating the Edison [portfolio] [ph].","At the end of 2013, we recognized rail performance issues with some carriers that could impact operations in 2014. As a result and in collaboration with the railroads we took the necessary steps to ensure adequate levels of inventory as we go into the summer peak burn periods. Another example of the strength in our scale and ability to react quickly to emerging risks.","Before I close, I once again want to say, hats off to the entire operations team for extraordinary performance in this record quarter. A quarter never before witnessed by many of us who have worked in this industry for many years. Thank you all and with that I will turn it over to Kirk.","Kirk Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 17. NRG delivered record adjusted EBITDA of $816 million in the first quarter of 2014 or more than doubling our EBITDA performance of a year ago. The bulk of this increase was driven by outstanding results from our wholesales business which generated $639 million in adjusted EBITDA as NRG's expanded east fleet in particular delivered strong operational performance during the extreme cold weather and volatile power prices in the first quarter.","Despite the colder weather and the resulting increase in supply costs, our retail businesses also performed well delivering EBITDA of $108 million for the quarter while NRG Yield delivered $69 million. For the quarter, NRG generated nearly $500 million in free cash flow before growth or nearly half of our previous guidance for the entire year. These strong quarterly results lead to increased expectations for 2014 financial performance which I will review in detail further.","Our total liquidity after adjusting for the cash used to fund the EME acquisition which closed on April 1 now stands at approximately $3.2 billion. Continuing our focus on prudent balance sheet management, we took advantage of the continued strength in the debt markets and through April successfully executed two senior unsecured notes offerings, totaling $2.1 billion both at a 6.25% rate, a new low for us in terms of unsecured coupon. These financings not only provided the $700 million in cash funding from new corporate debt we have planned for the EME transaction, the remaining proceeds permitted us to fully refinance our 2019 senior notes, reducing annual cash interest by $26 million and further extending corporate maturities in the process.","Finally, we have now executed a definitive agreement for the first drop-down of three right of first offer assets to NRG Yield for $349 million. We expect this all cash transaction to close later this quarter augmenting NRG's capital for allocation while helping NRG Yield deliver on its dividend growth objective. The proceeds from NRG Yield's successful issuance of $345 million in new convertible debt will be used to fund the transaction. And with the recent $390 million increase in NRG Yield's revolver to $450 million, NRG Yield now has increased capital flexibility to help fund additional drop-downs for NRG later this year.","Turning next to the guidance overview on Slide 18. Following our record first quarter results and taking into account the expected contribution from strategic acquisitions, we are pleased to announce a substantial increase in both our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth guidance for 2014. We now expect 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This $500 million increase over our previous guidance is driven in equal parts by the change in outlook for our wholesales business driven primarily as a result of the first quarter out performance and by the expected impact of our recently completed acquisitions.","The expected contribution from Edison Mission makes up substantially all of the $250 million expected EBITDA impact from acquisitions as we do not expect any significant contribution from Dominion Retail as we transition the Northeast customer base through the remainder of the year. Beyond 2014, however, we expect the net addition of $500,000 retail customers from the Dominion Retail acquisition which also includes the Cirro franchise in Texas to deliver a run rate of $40 million to $50 million in adjusted EBITDA.","I would also like to touch briefly on our expectations for residential solar following the acquisition of the Rooftop Diagnostics Solar platform this past quarter. The RDS acquisition represents an important step in better positioning NRG to benefit from the growing opportunity we see in residential solar. Specifically, RDS provides us expanded sales and installation capabilities which are critical in managing customer acquisition and system installation cost in order to realize the net returns from residential solar leases. As many of you are aware, the infrastructure and near term cost of growing this business do not translate into positive EBITDA in the near term. Rather, the value proposition is realized by growing the portfolio of long-term lease cash flows.","As a result, we would expect a modestly negative EBITDA impact as we ramp up our efforts in this area. Which is taken into account in our 2014 revised guidance. Later this year we expect to provide you with additional details regarding our residential solar efforts including cost, expected returns and capital requirements beyond the current year.","Finally, turning to NRG Yield. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $292 million is unchanged as we will update guidance to reflect the impact of the drop-down following the expected closing of the transaction later in the second quarter. As a reminder however, any changes to NRG Yield EBITDA guidance resulting from the drop-down will not impact consolidated NRG guidance. Our 2014 free cash flow before growth guidance is also increased by $250 million or more than 20%, driven by our increased expectations for adjusted EBITDA and partially offset by an increase in maintenance and environmental capital expenditures as we begin to deploy the capital necessary to ensure environmental compliance at the Powerton plant acquired as a part of the EME transaction.","In addition, cash lease payments associated with the Powerton and Joliet plants also impact free cash flow over the remainder of 2014. Beyond 2014, cash lease payments will fall to less than $1 million per year delivering run rate free cash flow accretion from the EME acquisition.","Turning to Slide 19. After taking into account the net cash component of the EME acquisition, NRG's current liquidity is approximately $3.2 billion. Cash used to fund the EME transaction represents approximately $1.5 billion of the $1.725 billion in acquisitions and growth investments shown in the sources and uses table to the right of the slide. In addition, as an update on the cash balances at GenOn, which I reviewed on our fourth quarter call. Driven by the solid first quarter results in the east, GenOn consolidated cash increase by $149 million during the quarter and now stands at just over $900 million. Taking into account the first quarter results, GenOn has now passed the trailing 12-months restricted payments test and is able to make distributions to NRG should we decide to do so.","GenOn Mid-Atlantic which at quarter end held $337 million in cash has also passed its restricted payment test and we expect GenOn Mid-Atlantic to make a distribution of $250 million for GenOn this quarter in order to rebalance liquidity across the various GenOn entities.","Turning to Slide 20. I am pleased to announce that we have executed a definitive agreement to complete the first drop-down of assets from NRG Yield. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, upon closing which we expect later this quarter, NRG Yield will purchase three ROFO assets for $349 million in cash plus the assumption of approximately $650 million in aggregate project debt. These assets include El Segundo, a 550-megawatt combined cycle plant under a tolling agreement with Southern California Edison with just over nine years remaining on the contract. And the TA High Desert and Kansas South solar facilities of 20-megawatts each, each with 20-year PPAs.","The transaction purchase price of $349 million which will be funded by NRG Yield using cash on hand will enhance capital for allocation at NRG and represents approximately 1.6 times the $225 million of net NRG equity invested in these three projects, all of which either came online or were purchased within the last year. In addition, we also expect NRG will receive an additional $15 million in cash for aggregate working capital balance at closing.","The purchase price of $349 million combined with debt assumed implies a total transaction value of approximately $1 billion and represents slightly more than ten times adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million. And on a combined basis these projects will add approximately $30 million in annual cash available for distribution helping NRG Yield achieve its dividend growth objectives. Taking into account our revised expectations for NRG's financial performance, we expect our balance sheet metrics will remain in line with targets and do not anticipate the need to allocate any of the proceeds from this transaction towards delevering.","The successful process towards completion of the first ever drop-down to NRG Yield represents an important initial step towards realizing the true potential of this important part of NRG's long-term growth. We anticipate announcing additional drop-downs by the end of the third quarter which we expect will likely include some of the EME assets while deferring the dropdown of the remainder of CVSR to 2015. However, at a minimum, we expect to execute additional drop-downs of assets representing at least the remainder of the $55 million in cash available for distribution we originally announced as being earmarked for drop-down over the course of this year.","And finally, updating our capital allocation progress on Slide 21. The net proceeds from the first three drop-down assets combined with the $250 million increase in 2014 free cash flow before growth, served to increase expected 2014 cash available for allocation to $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. $268 million of this capital will fund scheduled debt amortization largely at the project level. Approximately $1.45 billion of capital has been allocated towards M&A and growth investments including $840 million of cash towards EME and other acquisitions including Dominion retail. While integration costs now also include expected cost related to EME and Dominion.","Finally, taking into account the 12.7 million shares issued in connection with EME, $181 million of capital is allocated to NRG's recently increased common dividend of $0.56 per share on annualized basis. After these allocation items over the course of 2014, NRG has $823 million to $1.023 billion in excess capital remaining. We would expect to revisit any potential increases in return of shareholder capital following the second drop-down transaction which we would expect to take place in the third quarter. And with that I will turn it back to David for his closing remarks.","David Crane","Thank you, Kirk. Shannon, I don\u2019t have any closing remarks because we want to make sure we have about 15 minutes for questions. So please if you could open the lines we would be happy to take everyone's questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. You may begin.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Congrats on a great quarter. Following up on all the announcements here, I'd be curious, when you think about future capital deployment opportunities, how do you think about buybacks relative to further acquisitions to enable the DG renewable growth that you've been talking about? And in particular, how did you think about redeploying the cash that you're getting out of the NRG Yield sales of late?","David Crane","Well, I am going to turn that to Kirk to answer or not answer the question as he sees fit. But Julien what I would tell you from my perspective is that, to your question, number one, it's actually a pretty good time right now to be a buyer in the market. I mean we see sort of opportunities to create value. I guess someone who did three acquisitions in the first quarter would say this, but we do see opportunities across our space. What I would say though is, to the extent that you know for a long time on the generation side we wanted to have a bigger and better core generation fleet in PJM and that was a big, strategic priority.","But what I would say right now is, well, again to the point both on the generation side and on the retail side, where we have all the capabilities we need, we are in all the places where we need to be. And so it's a question of executing with what we have. And so I would say as a general rule, my view towards acquisitions right now is pretty opportunistic. If we can see something at a price that really makes sense, we will add to what we have. But we are really -- we are again at a point where we have a very limited number of gaps that we see to fill in terms of the capabilities we need to have. And even the gaps that we continue to perceive, which I am not going to tell you what they are because we don\u2019t want people to see us coming. The amount of money that it would take us to fill those gaps from outside acquisition is not a huge number compared to the amount of cash that Kirk has amassed over there. So with that sort of set up, let me turn it over to Krik.","Kirk Andrews","Well, I don\u2019t have to add very much to that other than the fact that the capital that we amassed as I know you are aware Julien, both with the combination of the actual receipt of the drop-down proceeds as well as our free cash flow generation, tends to be disproportionately loaded towards the backend of the year. Which is why we are kind of deferring addressing the return of capital to shareholders question until we realize the bulk of that free cash flow and drop-down proceeds. And I think depending on how the opportunities that David spoke to play out over the course of the year, as well as where our share prices combined with realizing that capital later in the year, we take all that into consideration in terms of balancing between opportunistic deployment of capital on the M&A side or acquisition side with returning to share repurchases.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great. And, Dave, just a quick follow up here. As you think about power, I just heard your comments about COMED. Where do you remain the most constructive on power upside, if you will?","David Crane","Julien, I don\u2019t want to give a wrong -- could you say the question -- where are we most constructive on the...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Yes. I suppose we have heard some comments from Exelon amongst others, saying we see x amount of upside in the market, etcetera. I suppose are you still as constructive on Texas or you're shifting towards PJM? And where do you see the most amount of upside or do you continue to see upside in power market?","David Crane","Well, you know everything -- it's like going to a movie Julien. Everything sort of relative to your perception is going in. I mean we went to great pains when we bought the Edison Mission portfolio to say, don\u2019t confuse this with us being bullish on the situation in the Midwest on the wholesale side. But as Mauricio said in his comments, there are signs of life in the COMED market. But I have to tell you, if you are just looking across our portfolio, clearly the east has been a pleasant surprise for us since the GenOn acquisition. But in terms of just basic fundamentals that you can sort of look at and reach out and feel and touch, we remain bullish on Texas. I mean the demand growth in Texas on a weather-adjusted basis was enormous.","While it was 3% -- I mean 11% in non-weather adjusted, 3% weather adjusted. You know announcements like -- I was out in California last week on the day that Toyota announced that they were moving 5000 - you know they had 5000 people employed in North America and they are picking up shop, closing shop in California and moving to Texas, so if you look at fundamentals I would say that the part of the country we are most bullish on remains Texas.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Cohen of ISI Group. You may begin.","Jon Cohen - ISI Group","Congratulations, guys. I don't see how that quarter could have gone any better for you guys.","David Crane","Okay. Thank you for your question, Jon.","Jon Cohen - ISI Group","I guess the first question maybe is for Mauricio. We've seen in the past couple of weeks or the last week particularly, a pretty huge move in the forward power markets. I was wondering if you had any color on what's going on there exactly? How much of this is real fundamental buying, how much of it is maybe some other technical factors?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Good morning, Jon. So I think I referred to it on my script but the move in power is actually, I would say there are two points. The first one is on the back of natural gas. And as you have seen natural gas has gone through a pretty significant rally and given the storage levels where we are, we think that if we get some early heat, we will see probably another leg off on natural gas. So that\u2019s the first driver of power prices. And as you can appreciate that has helped significantly dark spread or base load generators like us.","The second one which is probably a little bit more recent is an expansion in heat rates. And we saw that right after the CSAPR announcement. So I think markets are realizing that there may be more scarcity and better fundamentals shorter than what they believed in the past. But that clearly benefits some of the spark spread price. Those are two very discrete, I guess drivers that we have seen in the power space. With respect to liquidity, I will tell you that liquidity is probably the worse I have seen in many, many years. The balance of 2014 remains probably the best market and I think the prices, the market prices reflect to some extent decent volume. But beyond 2014 I would caution about the pricing that we are seeing because I think they are affected by liquidity.","Jon Cohen - ISI Group","Okay. So, you're saying we've seen a big move but on pretty poor volumes in the out years.","Mauricio Gutierrez","In the out years, yes, but in the front years I think the volume has been relatively decent. Having said that, the move that you have seen are supported by the fundamentals.","Jon Cohen - ISI Group","Okay, great. And then one other question on the distributed generation strategy. I was wondering if you had any, David, internal milestones or goals about how quickly you want to grow that business. I think on the last call I think you said it would be two years before you had cobbled together enough of a portfolio to drop into NRG Yield. Since then you've announced a few acquisitions. I wonder if maybe the timing of that has accelerated. So, what should we be looking for in terms of how you're executing there?","David Crane","Well, Jon, one, I don\u2019t want to be totally specific but the second thing is -- well, let me just tell you the way we are thinking about it. And some of this is anticipatory in terms of where we see the price going you know in terms of the expansion to the, sort of legendary price competitive with the retail price electricity in 20 to 25 states. The way I sort of think about it, by the end of this year we want to be in a position to compete in all the states where it makes sense for people to put residential solar on the roof. With all the tools that we need to sort of create value and bring the value to us. I mean one of the problems in the residential solar space for the last few years is, there is always some place in the value chain where value is being created but it's usually being created somewhere else.","So for a while it was the installers that were sort of capturing the benefit of solar module prices dropping like a stone and all that. And so we wanted a platform where the value that exists in the value chain sort of comes to us not to somebody else that we than enable. So we want to have our capabilities in place, totally in place in all the markets we want to be in by the end of the year. And then in 2015 we want to execute and we want to be a market leader. And whatever lead in the market is and in the industry that\u2019s facing exponential growth, I would rather not put a number on it other than to say, if you think of at least 2 million American homes that economically should have solar on their roof by 2015 and the current market leader Solar City is doing 30,000 a year, I don\u2019t need to take business away from Solar City to see that there is a market opportunity that\u2019s just almost infinite in its potential.","Jon Cohen - ISI Group","Right. Are there any capabilities that you think you're still lacking or are all of the pieces in place now?","David Crane","There is one or two. Thank you for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Good morning and congratulations. I wanted to talk about capacity prices in general and talk about your EME assets. I know you're going to come back with a more specific plan but we had, I guess, it's fair to say, fairly disappointing pricing last year. Would you need to see materially better capacity prices for the entire fleet at EME to be economically viable or do you think, given where we've seen recent trends, that they would be viable? Do we need to really see an uplift there to see the entire fleet viable?","David Crane","Hey, Stephen, Chris Moser is going to answer that.","Chris Moser","Hey, Stephen, it's Chris. First things first, I think PJM is moving a lot of levers to try and make sure that we see good prices out there. I mean FERC has accepted hard caps on DR. They have accepted the capacity import limits there. I know that there is still a couple of things pending in terms of the operability and changes to the incremental auctions. Last year at $59 out there in RTO, and that was on the low end of things, obviously we are hoping for better numbers than that. But keep in mind there is both energy and capacity as well. So it's the combination of those two. And we would like it obviously to hit good numbers in both of those. And a lot of the forecasts out there now have the capacity moving up against that 59 mark from the 16, 17 auction. And we are certainly hopeful that it does. But don\u2019t forget the wind in the sails back there is as David said, selling coal at natural gas prices and as gas continues to move up then that\u2019s going to help those assets as well.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","I see. So, the improved energy margin helps in that equation as well. As a follow up, just on your chart on page 14, looking at the PJM auction. I was curious about one of the remarks you made about new generation facing challenging economics, especially given the improvement in forward margins that we've seen. Could you expand on that a little bit?","Chris Moser","I think on the challenging economics side I think we struggle with seeing some of the newbuild costs relative to I think where we expect to see them or where we look at when we are trying to do are looking at projects ourselves and I think that\u2019s what that references to.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Okay. So, as you see the capital costs even with the improvement in energy margins, you struggle to see how the newbuild can make sense potentially.","David Crane","Yes, I mean Steven, I got to tell you, it doesn\u2019t matter what market you are in, even in Texas. I mean we are acquiring assets at deep discount to replacement costs. And so as prices get better we obviously have an opportunity to earn back the money we put in but we are not seeing things approach, pricing approach new entrant pricing. So how people are doing Greenfield in the merchant market, it's baffling to us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Can you review the changes in strategy of what assets you're going to drop down into NYLD in 3Q? I know originally it was CVSR but it sounds like it might be some of the Mission assets now. And I don't know if you can answer this question from NRG's perspective, but in your view will NYLD require equity to fund that next round of drop-downs?","Kirk Andrews","Well, in terms of the assets as I mentioned in my remarks, yes. Having now closed the EME transaction we expect the next phase of drop-down to include some EME assets and defer CVSR to 2015. I think it's safe to say if we have a bias within that portfolio, we would lean towards the shorter duration assets within that portfolio as being kind of the first in the queue if you will among the EME portfolio for drop-down. As far as equity issuance is concerned, certainly having basically used the proceeds from this first drop-down, additional drop-downs will require obviously additional capital at NRG Yield. We have the ability to some extent to bridge that capital using the expanded revolver I spoke to but ultimately the anticipation is, I think it's likely we will probably see an equity issuance kind of in the back half of the year. But we will revisit that in greater detail as circumstances unfold.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Very helpful. And then on coal, Mauricio, you talked about how you were able to address some of the rail disruptions to ensure adequate supply in 2014. Can you talk about how you did that? And then PRB prices seem to be ticking up here as you look at the forward curve, particularly 2015. So how does that impact the way you think about contracting?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, well, you know PRB in shorter term has been oscillating close the marginal cost of production. Historically there's been a [contango] (ph), though that has been tempered over the past 12-months. So as gas prices go up and certainly the announcement of CSAPR, you know lower sulfur coal becomes more desirable for generators. We are evaluating our hedge profile. As I said, we wanted to take care of 2014 given the increase in gas prices. We are now in the process of assessing 15 and beyond. We like the position that we are in. We have constructive gas fundamentals I already explained. So at the end of the day we are more concerned about the dark spread and less concerned about the absolute price of each of the commodities.","With respect to the railroad I think it is fair to say that we have, given the size and the scale of our portfolio, we were able to identify these potential risks in terms of deliveries. Regarding front of it, we have very constructive dialog with the railroads and we were able to bring our units at inventory levels that we feel are adequate as we go into the summer. I mean I cannot give you any more specifics. We have in the past disclosed inventory levels on a unit by unit basis and we are not going to do that given the competitive nature of it. But I think it's fair to say that we feel comfortable as we approaching the summer months.","David Crane","Shannon, we have a shareholders meeting in about 5 minutes, so I think we will take two more calls.","Operator","Our next question is from Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may begin.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Congrats on the good quarter. My question is directed towards Mauricio. You kind of talked about how maybe NYHUB heat rates moving up have a fundamental reason to them and there could be something changing with the load around that area. Could you maybe talk about what's changing that could maybe make you more bullish on the Midwest market?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Look, I think it's more on the generation side than the load. The load hasn\u2019t been particularly impressive in the Midwest and to the extent in the Northeast. We think that given some of the economic challenges and the higher penetration of wind and negative pricing, we believe that there is probably -- we are entering a transition period where additional retirements from base load resources that can cycle will happen particularly on units that are marginal, small with high fixed costs with little flexibility. So I think the market is starting to recognize that and you can clearly see it on the heat rate expansion. And I put the chart on the historical pricing and the forward pricing on COMED and I think it clearly has a awkward momentum to it. Now keep in mind the other one is, as I already said a couple of times, natural gas is right behind the price of power sold. So that perhaps is also something to look at.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","When you talk about these units are you speaking more about nuclear, coal or what type of generation?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, all of the above. I think coal and nuclear.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Is there an update on any kind of the repowering opportunities in California?","David Crane","Well, we remain optimistic but there is not really any specific update. But certainly I would hope to have one by the next quarterly call.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Trahan. You may begin.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Just, first curious if there's any update on the Maryland environmental rules going into the auction.","David Crane","Do you want to answer that?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. Good morning, Steve. What I can tell you is that we have a had a very constructive dialog with MDE. We are taking that into consideration with the plans that we have around our Maryland units and I think that\u2019s pretty much about as much as we can say around the state of the Maryland units. But I can assure you that it's been a very positive dialog between the two of us as of late.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Okay. So, you have more clarity you think on the future for those two units at least?","David Crane","Well, I think in relative terms we have more clarity, we don\u2019t have absolute clarity. So I think that\u2019s really all we can say right now, Steve. But since we didn\u2019t really answer your question, why don\u2019t you take (indiscernible)?","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","Yes. The other question is just -- you mentioned that we have the revival of CSAPR in some form and we're going to get these EPA THG proposed rules soon. When you think about the context of NRG overall in light of some of these new environmental rules, could you just maybe, again, give us your messaging on how you think about your company in context of kind of refocus on environmental rules?","David Crane","Well, I am not sure if this answers the question but I mean we are, in terms of the conventional system and the generation assets, I think we have to keep in mind that the average age of an NRG coal plant is 41 years old. So when we think of the long-term strategy of the company, it's not built around 41 year old assets but those 41 year old assets are very critical to the short to medium term and to keeping the lights on this year and next year. So I mean our environmental strategy is geared towards the amount of time that we expect the assets to continue to perform their functions. So with expect to the specific rules, we think we have a good -- you know we are not spending and insubstantial amount of money. And so we are complying with the various environmental laws that seemingly come and go. But we are also not investing in stuff thinking that these plants are going to be there 40 years from now. So guess I am not sure if there is something more specific about that that you would like me to focus on.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Trahan","You know I was thinking more in terms of the breadth of portfolio of assets that you have and your non-power. Net-net, do you think, obviously we don't know the details of how CSAPR will be implemented or how THG rules might be implemented. But do you think overall your portfolio benefits net from these rules or gets hurt by it?","David Crane","Well, I mean since we are in pretty good compliance position with the new rules, to be Machiavellian about it, the new rules drive other peoples plans out of the market than that will be beneficial to us. What I would say is one of the big lessons for us and hopefully for the public policy makers and I try to make this point in the context of Illinois is that, we have always made a virtue of being multi-fuel. The conventional system is clearly trending to an all gas all the time system. And the gas, now it's simply not prepared for that to happen. And so to us there is tremendous value in not only having gas plants but having coal plants continue and nuclear and even our oil plants. I mean we ran our oil plants more this last winter than I think in the last several years cumulative. And so the first and foremost, no matter how much we focus on sustainability and being green and all, the focus of a power company is always on keeping the lights on. And to me having a multi-fuel fleet of generation is the way to do that. So we certainly are going to try and do that but you can't keep plants open if they are just losing money, hand over fist. And you don\u2019t want to invest hundreds and millions of dollars in an asset that has left couple of years of life. And so that\u2019s the reality that we juggle everyday at this company. And I think every other power company does as well.","Anyway, I am sorry but I think we got to go. We are a few minutes late for our shareholders meeting. So thank you all very much and if there are any questions that we could not answer, my friend Chad here is sitting next to me, he would be happy to answer to questions at length. So thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"16365":["NRG Energy, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kevin L. Cole - NRG Energy, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Sonia. Good morning and welcome to NRG Energy's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast. This can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts.","As this is the earnings call for NRG Energy, any statement made on this call that may pertain to NRG Yield will be provided from NRG's perspective. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially.","We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation, as well the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligations to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation.","Now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG's President and CEO.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Chris Moser, Head of Operations; and Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail business.","I'd like to start the call by highlighting the three key messages for today's presentation on the slide 4. First, we delivered on our 2017 goals and we are reaffirming 2018 guidance. After a year of relentless focus on multiple transformative priorities, we have a much clearer path to value, and I am very optimistic about the potential for upside in our business, particularly given the strength we're seeing in our core markets.","Second, we have made significant progress in executing on our Transformation Plan. Our sale announcements over the past few weeks have brought us to over 90% of our target asset sale proceeds. We have also significantly exceeded our 2017 cost savings target and remain on track to achieve our target credit metrics. And third, with the vast majority of our asset sales now announced, and as a reflection of our confidence in the outlook for our business, we are announcing a $1 billion share buyback authorization with the first $500 million program to begin immediately.","Now, turning to our Transformation Plan update on slide 5, as you can see by our scorecard on the left-hand side of the page, we're making good progress. We have realized $150 million of recurring EBITDA accretive savings during 2017, which is over 200% of our original target of $65 million.","The excellent work throughout the organization and the focus on our continuous improvement initiative led to a jumpstart of our cost program early last year. This meant that we were able to pull forward some of our 2018 initiatives and exceed our target for 2017.","Looking forward, we remain on track to achieve our $590 million in total run rate cost savings by 2020. Our margin enhancement target is also on track, with details of this initiative to be covered at our Analyst Day.","Now, moving to our portfolio optimization, today, we're announcing the sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing business, or BETM, for $70 million in proceeds. This transaction is intended to further simplify, streamline and focus our business, and brings our total announced proceeds to over $3 billion. We remain on track to close all of our recently announced transactions by the end of the year and we will update you on our remaining asset sales as they progress.","Last, we continue to strengthen our capital structure. We are on track to achieve our target net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3 times by the end of the year. With the recent asset sale announcement, we now have line of sight to significant capital that can be deployed to our other capital allocation priorities. I continue to believe that our current stock price does not reflect the value of our business and presents the best return opportunity for our capital at this time.","I am pleased to announce that we have authorization for $1 billion share repurchase program, with a $500 million program to be launched immediately. And as we progress towards the closing of the asset sales and upon completion of our initial repurchase program, we will look to execute the remaining $500 million of our $1 billion program.","Moving to slide 6 with our business and financial highlights, it was a busy year that challenged us to make our business stronger in order to position ourselves for long-term success. Despite of all of these moving pieces throughout the year as well as the devastation of Hurricane Harvey in our core Gulf region, we not only achieved top decile safety performance, but it was our second-best safety year in company history. This is a testament to the culture and focus of our employees. And I want to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues for their hard work and for keeping safety our top priority.","Now, with respect to our financial results, we ended the year with just under $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and almost $900 million of free cash flow at the NRG level. Our Generation business performed well in light of a mild summer and our Retail business delivered its fourth consecutive year of EBITDA growth with $825 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. Hats off to the Retail team, which continues to deliver outstanding results every year.","Now, in addition to our Transformation Plan targets, during 2017, we also executed on our objective to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, resulting in a reorganization plan that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court in December of 2017. The plan is intended to transition GenOn to a standalone entity and provides NRG with certainty and visibility into the timing and services that need to be provided to GenOn in this transition period.","On slide 7, I want to briefly describe the impact of our actions over the past two years on our portfolio. We will have an opportunity to discuss this impact in greater detail at our Analyst Day, but in the meantime, I'd like to highlight just a few of the ways we're simplifying and improving our vertically integrated power business.","First, we are reducing our capacity by over one-half to roughly 20,000 megawatts and focusing our business on our core Texas and East markets to better match our Retail business. As we are scaling back our generation, our Retail business continues to be strong, with a steady stream increase in customer accounts and continued solid earnings.","And as you can see on the third row of the slide, the EBITDA contribution from the Retail business is becoming increasingly important, going from 25% in 2016 to 60% in 2018 of our total earnings. These changes will increase the visibility and stability of our earnings profile, given the better balance between Generation and Retail. It also increases our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. NRG has always been a cash flow machine. And with these changes, we will make our conversion even more efficient. We will improve our free cash flow conversion from 21% in 2016 to over 60% in 2018, a ratio unmatched in our industry.","And our business is changing. It is improving. We are rightsizing the portfolio and becoming leaner, stronger and better positioned to create shareholder value, both today and into the future.","Now, the markets continued to show signs of steady improvement, as highlighted on slide 8. Over the past several years, we have highlighted to ERCOT regulators and stakeholders the extensive risk of retirements and the slowdowns in new-builds, given chronic low prices.","Now, and as expected, these dynamics are causing significant market tightening and we're entering the summer of 2018 with the lowest reserve margin on record at 9.3%. This is well below the target reserve margin of 13.75%.","And the power prices in the forward markets where ERCOT are responding to these tight market conditions and have more dramatically the past few months to over $130 per megawatt hour for the summer, as you can see on the left-hand chart. This is a stark comparison to the average summer price of the past six years of only $35 per megawatt hour. At NRG, we're all working to ensure our plants are ready to meet demand and provide customers solutions to proactively manage their energy bills.","Now in competitive markets more broadly, there have been persistent calls to action for reform across states and across power markets. We continue to work with regulators and customers to make sure that competitive markets are not disrupted from a generation or retail perspective. We must get the pricing signals right in generation markets and improve the way that customers are able to access and consume power in the retail power markets. At the federal and state level, we see many indications of positive market momentum towards these objectives, and we will continue to be a vocal advocate for competitive markets.","Now, turning to slide 9, I want to provide a capital allocation update. During my first call as CEO two years ago, I told you that given the deep cyclical nature of our sector, we have to first ensure the robustness of our balance sheet when deploying capital. We wanted to leave no doubt about our ability to deliver on the value that we knew existed in our portfolio during any market cycle. We therefore focus on strengthening our balance sheet and paying down debt.","Since 2016, we have paid roughly $1.6 billion in debt and extended almost $7 billion of maturities, with most of them due well beyond 2022. Our identified asset sales will also help us to reduce close to $8 billion of debt. And with $640 million allocated towards deleveraging and another $1.2 billion of temporary cash reserve to achieve our credit metrics, we are well on our way to achieve our target net debt-to-EBITDA of 3 times by the end of the year.","As we continue to meet our top capital allocation priorities, we are now pivoting to evaluate growth opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Our immediate $500 million share buyback is reflective of our commitment to seeking the value-maximizing outcome for our capital. And as we progress towards closing our asset sales, we expect to execute on our additional $500 million authorization.","So, with that, I will now turn it over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on slide 11, in 2017, NRG generated $2.373 billion in adjusted EBITDA, $1.3 billion in consolidated free cash flow before growth, with nearly $900 million of that cash flow available at the NRG level. For the year, Retail delivered a robust $825 million in adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of low commodity prices, execution on cost reduction and continued customer growth.","Generation and Renewables delivered a combined $615 million in 2017 EBITDA, including a one-time impact of a non-cash expense of approximately $60 million due to excess oil inventory write-down and the write-off of obsolete spare parts inventory across the fleet. NRG Yield contributed $933 million in line with expectations.","Including today's announced sale of our Boston Energy Trading and Marketing business, the total Transformation Plan asset sales announced or closed to-date totals $3 billion, or only $200 million away from our revised target, which we expect to reach by 2019","In the fourth quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2023 unsecured notes at a record low rate for NRG of 5.75%, reducing annual interest expense and extending the previous maturity by five years. In 2017, we also completed the reduction of just over $600 million in corporate debt through redemption of the remaining balances of our 2018 and 2021 notes.","These redemptions eliminated our nearest corporate maturities and combined with interest savings on the 2023 notes refinancing led to annual cash interest savings of $55 million. I'd like to take a moment to address one element of our 2017 income statement, which is not included in our EBITDA results. That is a non-cash impairment charge on fixed assets and goodwill of $1.8 billion. This charge primarily consists of a $1.2 billion impairment loss on our interest in the South Texas Project, or STP, our nuclear facility south of Houston.","A regular fourth quarter process of revising our forecast of power and fuel prices and the impact on plant cash flows resulted in the need to write-down certain fixed assets, including STP. The portion of the total write-down from goodwill impairment was approximately $100 million and was largely related to the announced sale of BETM.","Turning to 2018 guidance, we are reaffirming our ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. Our 2018 pro forma numbers, which are based on the midpoint of guidance and reflect the implied 2018 contribution from retained businesses and Transformation Plan cost savings and margin improvements, are also unchanged from our call last month.","Importantly, as shown in the bottom row of the table, our pro forma financials also demonstrate the significant cash flow efficiency benefits from our retained businesses, as we convert over $0.60 of every $1 of EBITDA into free cash flow, a 66% improvement in cash flow efficiency versus 2017 results.","Finally, as noted in the bottom right of the table, while our 2018 pro forma EBITDA includes a substantial portion of the cost savings and margin benefits of the plan, we expect an additional $275 million of incremental EBITDA beyond 2018 as we reach our run rate of recurring savings by 2020.","Turning now to slide 12, we provided financial summary of our 2017 NRG level capital allocation, with changes since our third quarter update highlighted in blue. We finished the year with $440 million of excess capital remaining available for allocation, a $370 million increase versus our third quarter update. The substantial portion of the $370 million increase is largely due to an increase in total available capital and a decrease in allocations due to a shift in timing of expenditures and commitments from 2017 to 2018.","First, total capital available prior to allocations increased by $193 million, as shown on the far left of the chart. $92 million of this increase reflects the difference between actual 2017 NRG level cash flow and the midpoint of guidance, which form the basis for our previous update. The remaining $101 million was a result of the sale of our Minnesota Wind portfolio to a third party as well as various distributed solar dropdowns to NRG Yield.","On the uses side, actual capital allocated to the GenOn restructuring was lower due to the shift in expected emergence from 2017 to 2018 following the court approved plan in December. Actual 2017 capital allocated to GenOn consists of the $125 million draw by GenOn under the intercompany revolver in 2017, which will be repaid by GenOn upon emergence and NRG's pension contribution of $13 million. The balance of capital required for GenOn will be funded as a part of 2018 capital allocation, which I'll review shortly.","Next, NRG's actual cost-to-achieve associated with the Transformation Plan were lower than original expectations, exclusively due to a delay in timing from 2017 to 2018. And finally, the remaining small changes in allocated capital reflect minor updates in actual costs related to the debt financing and the 2017 growth investments.","The ending balance of $440 million in excess capital at year-end shown on the right-side of the slide forms the basis for our 2018 capital allocation, which I'll now review on slide 13. Our expected capital from existing sources on the left of the chart on page 13 includes the $440 million ending 2017 balance, plus the $1 billion of pro forma free cash flow from 2018. We expect this to be significantly augmented by the closing of our announced asset sales, which now include the sale of BETM. The total net proceeds of $2.792 billion reflect the aggregate proceeds of our 2018 announced asset sales net of transaction costs leading to total expected 2018 excess capital available of just over $4.2 billion.","Turning to uses of capital, we have allocated just over $2 billion to the balance sheet. And this is comprised of approximately $760 million of permanent debt reduction and the balance of $1.2 billion expected to be a temporary reserve to ensure we achieve our target ratio of 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA. I'll review the basis for this $1.2 billion reserve in greater detail on the credit slide at the end of my section. But we expect this $760 million in 2018 permanent debt reduction to be necessary to achieve the 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 2018 and beyond.","However, due in part to the fact that as I mentioned earlier, in 2018, we will not yet realize $275 million in recurring EBITDA from the full run rate of the transformation, our 2018 ratio does not yet reflect the full impact of the plan. As such, we are temporarily increasing our minimum cash balance in 2018 by $1.2 billion in order to achieve the target ratio. As our ratio improves over time, we would expect that this reserve would be released and available for future allocation.","Next, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, we're allocating $1 billion of 2018 capital towards share repurchases, the first $500 million of which we expect to begin immediately. Dividends, which represent the balance of allocated return of capital to shareholder, are unchanged versus the 2017 rate.","Turning to GenOn, we expect $178 million of capital towards the remaining commitments under the plan as GenOn expected to merge in 2018. This consists of the $261 million settlement amount and the 2018 pension contribution, partially offset by the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver. We expect $246 million in capital allocation toward the completion of our investment in cost-to-achieve under the Transformation Plan, including the amounts delayed from 2017 to 2018, I mentioned earlier.","Finally, expected 2018 growth investments of $195 million consist primarily of the Carlsbad project, which is more than offset by the dropdown proceeds reflected in the asset sale bar to the left, and Canal 3, which remains under option for purchase by GenOn under the plan of reorganization. Based on this current allocation, this implies $613 million of excess capital remaining to be allocated in 2018.","Please turn to slide 14, and I'll use this ending balance as a starting point to update the roll forward to pro forma 2020 excess capital we first provided last July as a part of the Transformation Plan announcement. Beginning on the left side of the chart on that slide, we start with the excess capital from 2018 of $613 million. I'll briefly walk from left to right to summarize the sources and uses in 2019 and 2020 to update or revise expected cumulative excess capital.","First, using our pro forma 2018 free cash flow as a basis for 2019 and 2020, adds $2 billion of additional cash. Next, as shown in the table above the third green bar, we had $404 million of cumulative incremental cash flow from the Transformation Plan, which is not reflected in our 2018 pro forma free cash flow. This incremental cash flow is primarily due to the increase in margin enhancements toward the 2020 run rate of $215 million, $90 million in additional cost savings versus the 2018 rate, and the $20 million increase in run rate maintenance CapEx.","Next, while our 2018 capital for allocation reflects the bulk of asset sales toward the target, we reflect the remaining balance of $205 million in additional proceeds expected by 2019. $90 million of additional cumulative cash flow reflects two years of cash interest savings on the $640 million of permanent corporate debt reduction we assume to take place at year end 2018.","Turning to uses, $88 million of debt amortization reflects the final portion of the repayment of Midwest Gen capacity monetization shown as debt for accounting purposes as well as ongoing but relatively de minimis amortization on our term loan. $30 million represents two years of our ongoing commitment to fund GenOn pension contributions as part of the plan. And finally, $75 million to fund two years of annual dividend at the current rate, which, of course, will be slightly lower based on the share buyback.","We add the release of $1.2 billion cash reserve, I spoke about earlier, to arrive an implied balance of just over $4.3 billion in excess capital through 2020, which for comparative purposes is $5.3 billion before taking into account the 2018 share buyback allocation, and represents in the aggregate over 60% of our current market capitalization.","And finally, turning to a brief update on pro forma 2018 capital structure on slide 15. First, we've modified this slide on the left side to more clearly reflect our consolidated debt balance and pro forma debt balance in the context of targeted divestitures. Just over $8.1 billion of our ending consolidated debt balance will be eliminated upon the closure of the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables business as well as the associated dropdowns to NRG Yield.","What remains is a pro forma consolidated debt balance of $8.5 billion, $1.3 billion of which is non-recourse debt. Approximately 90% of this remaining balance of non-recourse debt is the project debt balance at the Ivanpah project level which amortizes, funded by project level cash flows over the remaining life of the PPA. The balance of non-recourse debt at what remains of the Midwest Gen capacity monetization transaction, which is treated as debt for accounting purposes, and is fully repaid by 2019.","Turning to the right side of the slide, our 2017 recourse debt balance of $7.186 billion will be further reduced in 2018 by the term loan amortization and the permanent corporate debt reduction as a part of the Transformation Plan and included in 2018 capital allocation.","For presentation purposes, we've included only the $500 million minimum cash balance and the $1.2 billion cash reserve I spoke about earlier to derive implied net debt. We assume that $613 million in remaining excess capital in 2018, shown in the red box at the bottom of the slide, has been allocated to other opportunities.","The denominator of ratio starts with our 2018 pro forma EBITDA, which does not yet reflect the full run rate impact of the Transformation Plan with $275 million of additional savings expected beyond this year. We deduct the EBITDA from non-recourse entities, Ivanpah and Midwest Gen, and add back the cash distributions from those subsidiaries, as well as, consistent with our previous slides on credit ratios, certain non-cash expenses included in EBITDA.","Our net debt balance of $4.8 billion temporarily reduced by the $1.2 billion cash reserve reflects a ratio of 3 times our pro forma recourse EBITDA, in line with our revised target.","With that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kirk. Just a few final remarks on our priorities for the year on slide 17. And as always, our first priority is to deliver on our financial and operational goals. We're focused on executing our Transformation Plan objectives and bringing our announced asset sales to a timely close in the second half of the year.","In 2017, it was a priority to find a comprehensive resolution for GenOn, and during the year, we were able to achieve this objective. Now, with a plan confirmation by the courts, we're focused on working with GenOn on transition services so that GenOn may be a standalone company by September of 2018.","I want to acknowledge that 2017 was an important year for our company and we underwent a series of changes stemming from multiple strategic initiatives. I am very proud of our success in greatly simplifying our business and positioning ourselves to thrive under any market cycles.","I look forward to continuing our conversation about the long-term strategy and prospects of the company at our Analyst Day on March 27. I want to thank you for your time today and your interest in NRG.","And with that, Sonia, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Congratulations on continued progress on your Transformation Plan.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wanted to first touch on Texas. We share your optimism about the tightening supply-demand balance. Can you speak to how you're likely to be positioned for the summer, just at a high level? I know it's challenging to tell us exact megawatts of open position, but to the extent that we do see relatively high summertime prices, how can we think about the strategy for remaining open and positioned to take advantage of such price moves?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Right. So, Stephen, let me answer the question with, I guess, two timeframes. The first is 2018, because we have seen a pretty significant increase in prices for this summer, and then perhaps longer-term, which is more of a structural change. So, for summer of 2018, our Generation business is very well positioned. We actually disclosed in the Appendix our hedge percentages now on a pro forma basis. And as you're going to see, we are about 30% open on our heat rate exposure. So, we are \u2013 from a Generation standpoint, we're well positioned to benefit from the market tightening \u2013 or the tightening conditions that exist in the market.","Our Retail business is well positioned as well. As you recall, we back-to-back all our Retail, I guess, load and about half of our portfolio is fixed price. So you should expect that that half of the portfolio is completely locked in and the margins are locked in. The other half is in variable pricing. We take steps to manage that load and as the load progresses and it fixes their price, we can, what I describe is, detail or perfect the hedges that we have on that variable pricing load.","Now, longer-term, 2019 and beyond, our Generation business is pretty open, as you can tell on the hedging disclosures that we have provided. So, we will benefit from any structural changes. And we believe that these repricing of the Texas market is going to continue at least for 2019 and perhaps 2020, since \u2013 which is not going to have a chance to have new-builds in the span of a year and a half or two years.","Our Retail business, on the other hand, as you appreciate, if there is a structural change in the Texas market, all retailers will see this new level of pricing in the market. So, first of all, it doesn't put us in any disadvantage. Number two, having our Generation business, it offsets a little bit that margin compression that you should expect from \u2013 or that you could expect from higher prices in our Retail business, and more than offsets that.","And then, the final thing that I will say is volatility creates opportunities and it creates opportunities for retail companies and generation companies that are well positioned. We saw it during the polar vortex and we actually are ready to capitalize on this opportunity as perhaps customers look \u2013 want to move to retail companies that are better capitalized, that has generation behind them and superior service that we provide. So, we see that also as an opportunity.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No, that's very helpful. Shifting over to growth opportunities, obviously, you're generating a great deal of excess cash that could be deployed on organic growth opportunities. How do you think about the fields of opportunities? Is this a target-rich set of opportunities you're looking at? Or given where you stand today, is it relatively likely we should see fairly sizeable additional share repurchases just given the implied return in your own stock?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I mean, first is the latter part of your question, which is we're deploying $1 billion because we believe the returns on our stock are pretty attractive. And number two, we are always evaluating the market in terms of attractive opportunities. What I will say is just given where the market conditions are, those attractive opportunities are perhaps more likely in the Retail business than in the Generation business. And that's where we're going to be focusing.","I mean, keep in mind that in the East, we're still long Generation. We need to continue growing our Retail business both organically. And perhaps, if there is an attractive opportunity in the retail sector, we will evaluate that. But without a doubt, right now, the most compelling return for our capital is our own stock and that's where we're focusing on.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Thank you very much.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Antoine for Julien, actually. How are you?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi. To come back a little bit on the capital allocation beyond the $1 billion buyback, how would you guys think about a recurring dividend program in terms of payout and yield?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. I mean, it's one of the options that we have to returning capital to our shareholders. We laid out our priorities a couple of our earnings calls ago. And when I think of our capital deployment and capital allocation, it's just using those principles that we have already articulated to you. We need to make sure that our business is performing at the operating and financial level that we want.","Now that we have line of sight after the asset sales on our credit metrics, then it gives us the opportunity to start thinking about growth or returning capital to shareholders. And in the returning capital to shareholders bucket, I mean, we have the share buybacks or a dividend. And right now, just given where the stock is, we have opted to execute on share repurchases, but dividends are a very viable way to returning capital to shareholders.","We're going to continue evaluating that throughout the year. And once we finish with our initiatives and complete the repositioning of our portfolio, then we will have a robust conversation internally and with our board of directors to see what is the best way to return capital to shareholders. But, hopefully, the announcements that we're making today demonstrate and are clear examples of our commitment to be very disciplined when it comes to capital allocation","Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. And then, can you give us a bit more detail on the $215 million Retail EBITDA enhancement in terms of how you plan to achieve that and whether the timing you laid out previously has changed at all?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So, you're talking about the margin enhancement for Retail, right?","Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Right.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. We provided some information about that when we announced the Transformation Plan and in subsequent calls. I would tell you that we're investing heavily in our Retail business both on our asset sale channels and our IT platform, and just the further integration of Generation and Retail, which helps us manage \u2013 or better manage and optimize our margins.","In the Analyst Day, one of our objective is to provide you a lot more visibility and clarity in terms of how do we plan to achieve that $250 million. The only point that I also have made in the past is, if you look at what we have achieved the last three years, we actually grew our Retail business by $200 million.","So, what we're saying is, in the next three years, we're going to grow it by another $200 million. We have done it before. It's achievable, but I am very mindful that we need to provide a lot more specificity about how we're going to do that. And I intend to do that with my colleagues, particularly Elizabeth and Rob, as responsibles of the Retail businesses, to provide more specificity about how we're going to do it.","Antoine Aurimond - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Antoine.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Just a little bit of clean up on the Q4 and fiscal year results. The EBITDA came in a bit below the guidance range, but despite that the free cash flow was quite robust. Can I attribute that to that write-down that you guys called out in Q4 that was non-cash to $60 million as being sort of the key thing that took you down below the range?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Greg, it's Kirk. That's correct. I mean that's one of the reasons why I highlighted that non-cash, obviously, non-recurring impairment charge, which \u2013 the larger impairments on the fixed assets, that's just the acceleration of depreciation, which isn't part of EBITDA. But because that's inventory which would normally go through COGS, we chose to leave that obviously as part of our deduct to get to EBITDA, but obviously highlighting the fact that that's one-time and non-cash.","A couple of other elements as we roll through the statement of other (40:08) which are non-cash, we made an accrual for potential liquidated damages due to the delay of the Carlsbad project. I think that was like ZIP Code of $20 million of accrual towards the year end. And the remainder of sort of the unexpected variances, if you want to call it that for lack of a better term, we had is largely related to really the Renewables side, which is really still consolidated. We had some delays in projects reaching COD, which obviously delays their contribution of EBITDA. But overall, the main one to highlight is the $60 million you started with.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. Two more questions. On the $600-and-change million, that's currently unallocated. I presume you're going to give us some more guidance on how you're going to allocate that capital at the Analyst Day. And so it's sort of been held back and so you can give us a sense of how you're focusing the business strategy and therefore where you're going to allocate those dollars?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, Greg. I mean, we'll provide you some more clarity during the Analyst Day, but what I can tell you today is we're going to be applying the same capital allocation principle that we have applied to date. So, while we will do that on the Analyst Day, I don't think you should expect any big surprises in terms of the disciplined approach that we're taking on capital allocation.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And my last question, I think Stephen Byrd alluded to this earlier, just to be a little bit more direct. It's always been in hindsight over the years, a mistake to get too excited too early in the year in terms of guidance ranges and changing them. But forward curves and power market dynamics have improved quite significantly since you gave the guidance range. So, can you give us any sense of, given how you've hedged the portfolio, whether forward curves were to hold up at these levels for the remainder of the year? Where would you sort of be within the guidance range or is it just too early in the year and you don't want to get too excited about it?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, I mean, first of all, we're very comfortable with the guidance that we have provided today. That's why we're reaffirming it. Number two, we're not going to tell you specifically how we are positioning ourselves for the summer. I mean, we provided you the cash disclosures on the appendix. And as you can tell, we are roughly about 30% open on our total portfolio for heat rate exposure.","So, the commercial team, and Chris Moser is managing very closely the position in the summer. Now, with the further integrations that we have between Generation and Retail, we have a pretty good line of sight in terms of the needs that our Retail business needs \u2013 has to mitigate any potential impact on it. But where I stand today, I just feel very, very comfortable with the position of our business and the guidance that we have provided to you.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, guys. Have a great morning.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thanks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Mauricio. So the \u2013 just, I know I've asked this in the past, but just you do give the continued benefits of the cost cutting and the margin enhancement out to 2020. Just the base business, excluding that, and I know there's a lot of moving parts, but is it fair \u2013 in the past, we've talked about it being kind of assume flattish off of the base in 2017, 2018. Is that still kind of a fair thing to do, or any guidance there on other drivers?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Steve. It's Kirk. I mean, obviously, you already referenced sort of the on-to-come aspect of the Transformation Plan, that $275 million. But setting the Transformation Plan trajectory to the side, yes, we feel comfortable with the underpinnings of the base business, which is what informed our confidence to sort of reaffirm using that as an anchor in that roll-forward walk that I provided for you. Our outlook is consistent with that perspective over the long-term beyond 2018, yes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And then one more question on ERCOT and specific really to the summer peak. Could you talk about your generation-to-load match at summer peak days, periods, et cetera, in terms of protecting in the event there is high-volume spiky pricing?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey, Steve. Chris Moser here. I would think of it this way. With the integrated portfolio, the final position in any given hour is going to depend on where the Retail actuals come in and how the units perform in that given random hour out of the 700 on-peak hours we're going to see. If it's a high-load, high-price situation, we're set up to be \u2013 we're just fine in that situation. If it is extreme load and extreme price, that's going to limit the upside as the unit's length ends up covering and protecting Retail margin, so. But in an extreme load, extreme price situation in 2018, that should have some carry-forward and bleed through into 2019 and beyond, which should give us some pretty good hedging opportunities in the forwards. And keep in mind, that's an area where Retail retains a lot of pricing flexibility, given that they haven't sold everything out up there yet. So, I feel like we're in a pretty good shape right now.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. One last question, and you may want to leave this to the Analyst Day, but just your main peer company talked a little bit about, thinking about whether they might want to look to investment-grade credit metrics or rating in the future. Is that a priority for you at all, or is that really not something that you're focused on?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, it's Kirk. Not primarily focused on it. I mean, certainly, improvements in credit ratings are something we certainly do aspire to from a cost of capital and reliability of access in the market as you sort of leg up the scale, if you will. But I think we feel comfortable with sort of the ZIP code of that BB ratio, striking the right balance between delivering the right equity return to our shareholders on the one hand and managing the risk of the balance sheet on the other, and most importantly, maintaining our confidence in the access to reasonably priced capital even through the cycle.","That's not to say we continue to look towards that. I mean, as I think I maybe even said in a prior call, maybe the last call we had, we don't look at our credit ratio objectives as a set it and forget it. We continue to review those in the context of what we see, including, but not limited to, the fact that obviously the tax shield is not quite as robust today as it was a few months ago by virtue of the Tax Reform Act.","So that's in constant review, but I think suffice to say, that's not a primary focus. We're comfortable with our BB target.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","And, Steve, let me just add that we have been very clear about our priorities. We have communicated that to all of you. Those priorities are right now on execution. That's our focus right now is to execute on those priorities. And as Kirk mentioned, I mean, once we have demonstrated that we've delivered on those commitments that we've made, then we will reevaluate. But for now, our priorities are very clear and we're executing towards them.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","So most of my questions were answered, but just on sort of the dividend and just a quick follow-up. Is there longevity in the token dividend? So like as you sort of think about returning capital and assuming you decide it's more economic to buy back shares, why sort of retain this token dividend? Should we sort of think about it as either you potentially looking to enact a higher payout ratio and maybe growing that dividend, given what your cash flow profile is, or removing the policy altogether? So why keep this dividend if you're going to maintain it at such a low level?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","No, that is a good observation, Shar. And we actually have been having conversations internally about that. And as you can appreciate, we're going to have \u2013 we're going to be talking to you in a more comprehensive basis around our capital allocation program, but importantly, in the context of our long-term strategy and long-term prospects that the company has. So, this is something that we're going to be getting into more detail at the Analyst Day.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Kirk, let me just follow-up real quick on sort of your leverage targets, like \u2013 and outside of ratings, you do have a peer that's noticeably shooting below that. You've got the integrated utility GenCos that are certainly leaner. You have other cyclical industries that have tighter metrics. Is 3 turns really optimal outside of ratings, especially given that you're kind of left without an industry, a sector, and eventually, going to have to benchmark yourself with other cyclical industries as you project sort of this message to investors? So, what is optimal? Is 3 turns still optimal, or is your thought process should it evolve?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, to avoid repeating some of the things I said in response to Steve's question, we are comfortable and reaffirming that 3 times target. And what informs our thinking beyond what I've talked about in the past about striking the right balance and everything else is cash flow context matters to us at the end of the day. And both Mauricio and I again reiterated how pleased we are with what the knock-on effect of what we're doing in the Transformation Plan means in our ability to more efficiently translate EBITDA to free cash flow.","And legging towards two-thirds or $0.67 of every $1 translating, that makes a big difference. So, if I'm comparing apples-to-apples to somebody else's at a 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, but they're converting $0.35 on every $1 where I'm converting $0.70, that calibration factor on cash flow, I think, is important not to ignore because it certainly informs our thinking. And while EBITDA is a nice statistic, cash rules the day in terms of financial flexibility. And that I think is a distinction that's worth repeating.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Okay. That's helpful. Congrats, guys, on executing on the plan so far.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Shar.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to go back to the sensitivity of earnings to changes in heat rates. So, when I look at slide 24, where you show the sensitivity of your margins, especially for the Texas business, it seems largely unchanged versus what you showed us, I think, during the financial update \u2013 actually, during the third quarter earnings call. And you had a pretty meaningful move in heat rates in Texas. So, the sensitivity versus the levels at the end of the year, is this versus the current guidance? What is the basis for that sensitivity?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","This is Chris, Angie. I believe that that is as of this week \u2013 are you looking at the heat rate sensitivity, $54 million Texas 2018?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes.","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","That's what you're looking at? Yeah, think of it as $54 million from what is arguably a higher spot.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","And, Angie, let me just \u2013 because you were talking about comparing against previous disclosures, so I think it's important to mention that in this new hedge disclosure, I think we pulled out some of the portfolios or assets that we're selling, particularly the LaGen business. So, I just want to make sure that the team is working with you, too, as you're looking at previous disclosures with new disclosures that you're comparing apples-to-apples. And this new hedge disclosure I believe does not include the businesses that are held for sale now. But that's an important \u2013 I guess that's an important piece of information, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. But there's nothing being sold in Texas, right? I mean, Texas Generation assets are intact. So you're saying that the...","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Angie, we can...","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","We can \u2013 let me just make sure \u2013 I am looking at the third quarter 2017 earnings presentation where the heat rate sensitivity for Texas and South Central is $62 million and the one that you have in front of you with the $54 million is Texas only. But we can run this down off the call, if you like.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Okay.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Abe.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just following up on your hedge profile, you remain more open for next year than I remember you being in recent years. Is this a reflection of your view that there's potentially more improvement in the forward curves or is this liquidity or something else?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","No. It's two things and it goes to a little bit of what I was just talking to Angie about the \u2013 if you're looking at the previous quarters, they would have had South Central included in that. And given that South Central has a pretty big short position in it against the co-op contracts, when you pull that out and you're just looking at Texas by itself or Texas and the rest of the pro forma situation, it'll look slightly less hedged. But given that South Central is, give or take, a 20% kind of a number, if you look back at 4Q 2016 for 2018, we were about 44% hedged gas.","And if now we're at 4Q 2017, looking at 2019, it's kind of 26%. So, that give or take, rough and tough, looks pretty similar to where we were on an apples-to-apples basis. Unfortunately, Q4 2017, Q4 2016 aren't apples-to-apples because of the South Central being pulled out of the numbers on the 2017 number.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. But I think it's fair to say that we were expecting a market tightening in Texas. We knew that the chronic prices that we experienced over six years were going to accelerate retirements or slow down new-builds. We positioned ourselves correctly. I think we will see the benefits in our portfolio. And we will execute on our strategy \u2013 on our hedging strategy just the way we have executed in the past.","We're opportunistic based on our commodity price yield. We manage our credit ratios and our balance sheet. And now, we also have to be mindful that the synergies that exist between matching Generation and Retail. So, these are the three legs of our strategic hedging program. We are not deviating from that. And I think you should expect as the year progresses and the market reprices itself or re-rates itself that we will execute accordingly.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And that's all. I will see you at the end of the month.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, Abe.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mauricio Gutierrez for any closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Sonia, and thank you again for your interest in NRG. We're very excited about the changes that we have made in our portfolio and our business. And I look forward to talking to all of you at the end of the month. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program.

Crane","Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm joined here by Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer; and Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. They will both be giving part to the presentation as usual. I'm also joined by Chris Moser, who runs Commercial Operations for the company; and Elizabeth Killinger, who's responsible for our Retail business for all of our brands, and both of them will be available to answer any questions that you might have.","I'd like to start on Slide 3 by giving a quick -- my quick take on our second quarter performance. I'm going to be quick about it because both Kirk and Mauricio will be discussing these results in more detail, but also because I want to spend a little more of my allotted time than usual on the strategic positioning of NRG going forward. I'm choosing this opportunity to talk about strategy because some of our most recent developments in our business provide a good context for how we think about the plentiful value-creating growth opportunities that we see in front of us and what is sometimes loosely called the alternative energy sector at a time when we see weakening long-term fundamentals in our traditional, conventional generation grid-based business. But first, let me start by focusing on our performance year-to-date. Never before in my 11 years at NRG do I recall a first half of the year where we were so whipsawed by the weather. A severely cold winter followed by a summer, which, to date, through the second quarter and so far into the third quarter, has been completely devoid of extreme weather in any of our core markets. Fortunately, to some degree, our diversification away from being exclusively a wholesale generator, first, into retail and then into clean energy, has increased the resilience of our earnings in the face of mild weather and tepid wholesale electricity demand. Under these circumstances, I am very pleased with the $671 million of adjusted EBITDA that we are reporting for the second quarter and the $1.487 billion of EBITDA year-to-date. As this summer has so far failed to materialize in the forward commodity prices affecting our wholesale generation business have weakened, NRG share price in recent weeks has dropped 20%, reflecting the continued strong correlation between NRG share price and natural gas prices. At the same time that NRG's stock prices dropped under the pressure of weakening commodity prices, NRG Yield has stood strong with the share price well more than 100% above the price that it IPO-ed at just 12 months ago. As NRG stock has dropped, NRG Yield, in just the past 2 weeks, has gone to market with 2 vastly oversubscribed capital market issues, a 10-year green bond that priced at 5 3\/8% and upsize due to market demand and a secondary equity issue that priced at $54 a share, even though the stock had closed at under $52 a share at the beginning of the day of announcement. NRG Yield, of course, consists of contracted and regulated assets not subject to commodity price risk. But for this purpose, what interests me is that many of the assets of NRG Yield had existed within NRG for many years. Before Yield, the value of our contracted assets has never been recognized by the Street as they were buried under the weight of close to 50,000 megawatts of wholesale generation assets that were subject to merchant price exposure.","Now as we look at the exciting opportunities that present themselves to us outside of the merchant generation space, we are intent on taking the first step to duplicating the success of NRG Yield with the other high-growth segments of our business.","If you would turn to Slide 4, you will see how we are thinking about NRG and our businesses going forward with, from the shareholder's perspective, as many as 6 distinct value propositions, each with exciting growth opportunities of its own, each with a focused management team dedicated to win in its own competitive environment and each, ultimately and down the road a bit, a candidate for value recognition on Wall Street in the same manner as NRG Yield. We call this new structure the NRG Group of Companies, and in shorthand, the 3 plus 2 plus 1 structure, to reflect the fact that we are organizing into 3 main businesses called NRG Business, NRG Home and NRG Renew, which are differentiated from each other principally by the nature of the energy consumer that they each serve. The way energy is procured at the office is obviously quite different from the way it is procured at the home. The 2 and the 3 plus 2 plus 1 represents the 2 special purpose companies, Petra Nova and eVgo, that have very distinct businesses, capital structures and technological bases, but also have symbiotic connections to our 3 core businesses. In the case of Petra Nova, through turning our coal plants' greatest liability, their carbon emissions, into a highly profitable revenue-generating asset, and in the case of eVgo, by creating a legion of forward-leaning, clean transportation enthusiasts into end-use energy consumers aware of, and hopefully, loyal to NRG.","The 1 and the 3 plus 2 plus 1, obviously, is NRG Yield, which already has its distinct identity and value proposition on Wall Street. NRG Yield going forward is a critical member of the group in enabling and enhancing the value of all the 5 companies by providing a highly competitive source of capital for their contracted assets. Today, that means NRG Yield acquires from NRG contracted, combined cycle assets, opportunities in our new structure, which will arise through NRG Business, and also utility scale renewable projects, opportunities in the new structure that would arise through NRG Renew. But as we go forward, we expect to offer NRG Yield an even broader range of assets benefiting from long-term contracts and arising, not only out of NRG Business and NRG Renew, but also possibly out of NRG Home or even NRG Petra Nova. This, of course, would be in addition to NRG Yield having continued success in its own third-party acquisitions, which has the advantage of providing enhanced cash distributions back to NRG.","There is more about this new structure that can be illustrated on this Slide 4 or installed in the time I have available, so I'm going to concentrate my remaining time today with a brief explanation of NRG Home and NRG Petra Nova. As to the other 4 companies and the full rationale behind the totality of this reorganization, we will lay that out for you in considerable detail over the coming months.","Let's start with NRG Home on Slide 5. At NRG, our Retail businesses have been working for some time to differentiate themselves, first, through offering renewable energy at Green Mountain, through offering affinity programs at NRG Plus. And most recently, our focus has been on becoming a key player inside the smart interconnected home of the future. And with the formation of NRG Home, we aim to focus on this objective all that much harder. NRG Home, in short, is going to combine under one roof the almost 3 million retail customers currently served through all of NRG's retail brand, with our much smaller but fast-growing residential solar company, NRG Home Solar, in order to realize the obvious synergistic benefits that each can bring to the other and to capture the sustained double-digit growth that we believe will be realized by the top tier companies in the residential solar space, as the American public increasingly embraces the idea that they can make a difference in the race to the clean energy economy with their individual energy decision-making.","Even though as depicted by the name, the initial focus of NRG Home will be on bringing seamless energy solutions, both systemwide solutions and distributed solutions, into the stationary environment of the home. NRG Home will also be focused, as Reliant already has begun to do, on bringing mobile and clean energy solutions to the end-use energy consumer with the ultimate goal for us being wherever you are, whatever you are doing, for however how long you are doing it. And without regard to whether you are able to tether yourself to an electric outlet through an electric cord, we want to be your energy supplier. You should expect to hear a lot more about this aspect of NRG Home in the weeks and months to come.","Now turning to Slide 6 and shifting gears, let me turn your attention from the end-use energy consumer end of our growth opportunity spectrum back to the other end of the spectrum, wholesale generation, and specifically, the future of big, solid fuel-fired power station that represent the backbone of both NRG and of the status quo grid-centric hub-and-spoke power system that Americans have relied on since the 1930s. When it comes to conventional utility scale generation, a lot of the trends are not good. Since electricity remains the only commodity that cannot be stored, wholesale generation is, at its core, a primitively basic business completely ruled by supply and demand fundamentals. Rebecca Smith recently reported a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal about the rupturing of the historic correlation in the United States between GDP growth and electricity demand growth, quoting the CEO of AEP as referring to this as the lost decade of electricity demand growth. Her article focuses on the fact that the utility business model is under strain because it is entirely dependent on more or less continuous demand growth in order to cover the ever-rising cost of operating and maintaining the grid. What her article did not mention, but is obviously also true, is that while the long-term supply-demand wholesale fundamentals and trends paint a bleak picture for vertically integrated utilities, the same future is bleaker still for the purer wholesale IPPs, which face the same weak fundamentals but lack the iron dome of rate-based regulation protection that covers the investor-owned utilities. On top of the challenge of weak long-term supply-demand trends, there is the particular challenge to coal plants raised by potential environmental regulation. While it is early days yet in the promulgation of greenhouse gas regulations by the EPA from stationary sources, the long-term trend towards a carbon-constrained world is clear. And to state the obvious, that trend is commonly perceived as not being good for coal plants, and to be equally obvious, at NRG, we own a lot of coal plants. However, if we can turn carbon emissions from a long-term liability into a high-margin, free cash flow generative, commodity risk-mitigating, long-term assets, then we will have accomplished quite a bit in terms of enhancing the longevity and the value of our coal-fired fleet. This is exactly why we are investing $300 million of NRG cash and in-kind equity in the WA Parish carbon capture to enhance oil recovery project. The Parish project, first and foremost, is a carbon monetization play. In this case, we monetize through oil. Our economic return will be a function of the increased productivity of the carbon-flooded field times the realizable price of the oil produced. NRG, which currently has minimal commodity price exposure to crude oil, gets paid through the oil sales with the current forward price curve, providing sufficient cushion against an oil price downdraft, as depicted in the bottom right of this Slide 6. The secondary benefit of the Parish project, obviously, is that it is a highly effective carbon hedge and the way we think about that is shown on the upper right portion of Slide 6. If and when a carbon price is imposed, the impact on Parish will be to reduce the oil price necessary for NRG to earn its minimally acceptable equity return on the project.","But in light of the problems and costs -- turn to Slide 7. In light of the problems and cost overruns at other carbon capture projects, we are being asked, what about the risk? The key features of the Petra Nova project, as depicted on Slide 7, that distinguish it from the 2 other high-profile CCS projects built in recent years in Indiana and Mississippi is that the Parish project involves more established post-combustion carbon capture technology rather than precombustion IGCC technology. And the Parish project makes no attempt to alter the steam balance of the existing coal plant to provide energy for the carbon separation process. Instead, at Parish, steam for the process will be provided by a dedicated gas-fired steam generator. And that is why Parish is actually a gas-to-oil price arbitrage play rather than a coal-to-oil project. Finally, what distinguishes Parish from the projects in Indiana and Mississippi, which were both built by rate-based utilities, is that Parish is structured on classic project finance terms, with the various risks of the project warned by the partner best able to mitigate them. The technology and EPC risk of the project, in particular, is borne by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries under a fixed price, fixed schedule guaranteed performance contract. We have a very high degree of confidence in MHI and their technology, which underpins our investment in this project. In short, our Wholesale and our EPC group are very focused on making the Parish project a success, not only because it represents a sizable investment for NRG, but also because harnessing the potential of this technology is likely to be the key to the long-term longevity of our coal plants in a world where electric demand is tepid and carbon constraints, in the form of carbon pricing, are an ever-growing risk.","So let me conclude my part of the presentation on Slide 8 with a few bullet points. First, our core businesses have executed superbly in the first half of the year, with solid first half financial results to show for effort. But in this, the commodity end of our business, we remain subject to the vicissitudes of the weather. Second, as we have said repeatedly over the past few years, ever since the Great Recession in fact, we see the potential for value creation in our space swinging from the wholesale side to serving the end-use energy customer, and today, NRG is taking the next big step in organizing ourselves in a manner that gives us the best chance to capture that opportunity to the maximum of our potential. Third, our sector, which is already modestly carbon constrained on the regional level, is certain -- eventually to become more carbon-constrained, and we are taking affirmative steps now not only to prepare for it, but to profit from it. And fourth, and while I did not have the time to discuss this in my comments today, the leading corporations of our time, like Unilever, all have made major commitments to sustainable behavior, including mass adoption of clean energy, and NRG is very well positioned to assist these companies in achieving their global sustainability goals. And fifth and finally, we applaud the success of NRG Yield, which continues to serve as a critical cost of capital competitive advantage for the NRG Group, and we will continue to act to ensure that NRG Yield remains the premium company in the emerging class of publicly traded yield vehicles. The future indeed is bright for NRG.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we were focused in executing our spring outage plan, a significant endeavor now that we have over 50,000 megawatts in operation, and particularly important given the hard rounds we had this past winter. We were busy integrating the Edison Mission plants into our operations. And finally, we were focused on evaluating operational improvements in our Midwest generational fleet. All of this was done while maintaining an excellent safety record well within the top decile of our industry, an accomplishment that makes us all very proud at NRG. As David pointed out, mild weather so far this summer has affected spot and forward curves, but I am pleased to say that we fared well during the second quarter. We continue to monitor and assess the prospects for the balance of the summer, but I take some comfort in the fact that our commercial team took advantage of the opportunity provided by the market after the polar vortex to increase significantly our hedges in 2015 and 2016 at prices above the current market. Finally, we continue to execute on our fleet-wide revitalization program, and most importantly, as we promised you during our last earnings call, our plants around the Edison Mission portfolio. Today, we are announcing a comprehensive operational improvement and environmental compliance plan for the Midwest Generational plants. We're doing this after only 4 months of ownership and are confident that we're putting the pieces in place for a long successful ownership.","Turning to Slide 11. As you may recall, in June of last year, as part of the outcome of our operational improvement plan around GenOn acquisition, we embarked on an effort to economically optimize certain of our older facilities by converting them to different fields, with a purpose to reduce costs, comply with the new environmental regulations and respond to pricing as provided by the market. As such, I want to provide you an update on this important strategic initiative. Previously, we announced the field conversions at Avon Lake and New Castle and the reliability contract for Dunkirk. We're now moving forward with 2 additional field conversions at Portland and Shawville, one to oil and the other to gas. These units will provide needed capacity and fuel diversity to the PJM system, as well as demonstrating during the winter months. In addition, we have executed a 10-year agreement with National Grid to repower the Dunkirk station with natural gas.","Moving to Slide 12. We are announcing today our optimization and enhancement plan for the Midwest Generation portfolio. This plan takes into consideration the prevailing market conditions, environmental regulations and the impact on our communities and our employees. As a result of the actions we're taking today and the $545 million that we're investing, this plan will significantly reduce our environmental footprint by lowering emissions for carbon dioxide by 60% and for SO2 and NOX by 90% and 65%, respectively. All these while expanding fuel diversity in the region. You can see the details of the plan on the left side of the slide. Powerton and Waukegan will remain on call, with upgrades to the back-end controls, specifically dry sorbent injection or DSI to control SO2 and enhancements on the electrostatic precipitator to improve particulate collection to enable us to comply with the more stringent air regulations under MATS and CPS. Joliet will be converted to natural gas, with an expected online date of 2016. Finally, and after careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to retire Will County Unit 3 by April 2015, and we plan to keep the second unit in operation as long as we can comply with all applicable environmental requirements. The closure of Will County is a difficult decision for us, but the economics simply do not work in the current price environment, given the back-end capital investment that would be required. We will do everything we can, as we have done in the past, to make open positions around the company available to the dedicated employees at Will County, and Midwest Gen will be affected by this decisions. This plant is consistent with our core strategy of streamlining costs, repowering or closing marginal facilities given the current market environment, maintaining or expanding fuel and geographic diversity in our portfolio, reducing the environmental footprint and extending the life of existing assets that otherwise would have shut down due to more stringent environmental regulations. Importantly, and as you can see on the right side of the page, this plant and the investments required to implement will be completed with an attractive economic profile, driven by optimizing the cost structure of the remaining coal plants, driving out fixed costs through fuel conversions and by taking advantage of improved market fundamentals. We believe our investment will be completed at a very low multiple, driving significant accretion to you, our shareholders.","Turning to operational performance on Slide 13. We had another quarter of strong safety results with 113 out of 126 facilities without a recordable injury, ending the quarter well within top decile performance, a significant accomplishment given the fact that we executed 171 planned outages and 614 maintenance outages so far this year. Generation for the quarter was down slightly from last year, driven primarily by a combination of planned and unplanned outages, including an extension on the refueling outage of South Texas Project Unit 1, but we had to do additional work in the stator at the main generator. The unit returned back to service in time for summer operation and has been running well. Unit 2 has also been running well, with 99.5% availability factor for the year. With the size of our fleet, it is easy to overlook great performances by individual plants. On this note, I want to take a moment to recognize the entire team at Limestone for the recent run at Unit 1, which lasted 340 consecutive days. Congratulations on a great accomplishment.","As we have mentioned before, given current market conditions, we have increased our number of maintenance outages during low price periods to ensure we are available when it matters the most. This, of course, has an impact on our availability metrics, but we have been able to improve on our reliability performance during those periods, as you can see on the bottom left chart. Our gas fleet continues to perform exceedingly well with over 97% starting reliability for the year and 950 more starts compared to last year.","Moving on to Slide 14. Our Retail business delivered a solid second quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $173 million, $33 million higher than last year. We delivered another quarter with robust customer growth, demonstrating the continued momentum we have in attracting and retaining customers. In addition, we were able to maintain retail margins with operations and maintenance cost per customer for the quarter down over 13% year-over-year, demonstrating results from operational improvement efforts and the scalability of our Retail platform. On a regional basis, we grew customer count in Texas by 16,000 customers for the quarter as a result of effective execution and expansion of innovative products and services, where we have observed retention rates improving by up to 25% for the customers enrolled in these products. Total volumes compared to last year were relatively flat, with the mass volumes up 26% quarter-over-quarter due to the Dominion acquisition and the C&I down by 15% due to continued discipline and commitment to profitability. In the Northeast, we grew customers by 19,000 organically for the quarter, in addition to the Dominion customer growth. Overall, the integration of Dominion's retail energy business is going well and we're seeing better-than-expected earnings and customer retention.","Now turning to Slide 15, and starting with ERCOT. The second quarter was 8% cooler than the 10-year average, and so far this summer, we have not seen a single day above 100 degrees in Houston. In our power markets, it is not unusual to see an overreaction in the forwards to what is happening in the spot markets, and we believe that is the case in ERCOT, where mild weather has impacted both spot and forward prices. As you can see in the upper left chart, forward pricings are well below new build economics and do not reflect the near-term fundamentals in the market. We show spark spreads, both historical and forwards, plotted against the number of days above 98 degrees in Houston as a proxy for hot weather. Only 1 year in this chart supported new build economics. Difficult to rationalize in a market where historical net operating reserve margins have been in the single digits and forward reserve margins are at or below targets.","This summer, we have the implementation of the operating reserve demand curve, designed to improve price formation during scarcity events. So far, a major disappointment to the market where the ORDC price adder has averaged less than $0.10 per megawatt hour across all hours through July. As we said on previous occasions, we support any structural changes that improve price formation in the market, but it is clear to us that ORDC is a scarcity price formation mechanism and not a resource adequacy solution. The weather forecast for next week looks better as temperatures will move into a normal range, pushing 100 degrees in several Texas cities. We believe there is plenty of time still for ORDC to be of some value this summer.","As I said, the near-term fundamentals in ERCOT remains strong, as you can see in the lower chart, with reserve margins hovering around the current target reserve margin. This, in part, due to the new generation brought online this summer, which we believe was, in large part, from the hope for a potential capacity market and the expiration of the production tax spreads for wind. The natural question is, what could potentially change this perceived stable outlook? First, is the decreasing likelihood of new projects moving forward given the current and historical prices, as well as the lack of any headway on resource adequacy; second, is the increasing possibility of additional retirements, given the lack of scarcity pricing; and finally, increased probability that low growth saw prices to the upside, especially compared to what, from our perspective, looks like a low official forecast.","Now moving to PJM. The results of the capacity auction was somewhat dated now, where a key component of the asset optimization plan that I discussed previously. We saw strong prices driven in large part by a decrease in imports and demand response, disciplined portfolio bidding and unit retirements offset somewhat by new gas generation. Given these capacity results, the spark spreads required to incentivize new builds are getting close to current market, and in some cases, were achieved briefly after the polar vortex. We believe the market is providing the right price signals, given the amount of generation that it needed to replace marginal coal units, and we applaud PJM for letting the market work. We remain constructive that PJM market and forward prices support our plans for the Midwest Generation fleet.","Turning to our commercial update on Slide 16. We took advantage of the rally in power and gas prices resulting from the cold weather -- winter and increased our power hedges during the quarter by 33% and 15% for 2015 and 2016, bringing our total hedge levels to 84% and 40%, respectively. With respect to coal, we felt it was prudent to rebalance our coal hedges to match our power position and lock in large spreads for our plants. Coal inventory levels remain adequate for the summer, with rate performance showing some improvement.","Some brief comments on the PJM '17, '18 capacity auction. There were some speculation about the number of megawatts that we clear in the auction. While in the past we have not provided specific numbers, I wanted to provide you some assurance that the results were a net positive for NRG and that we clear virtually all megawatts that we offer into the auction. As we move through the summer, all of us at NRG stand ready to take advantage of any summer weather and its corresponding market opportunity. We're moving to execute on the plan that we laid out for you around the Midwest Generation fleet and will continue to manage our commodity exposure, given current market conditions for 2015.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 18, NRG is reporting second quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA of $671 million, including $389 million from Wholesale, $173 million from Retail and $109 million from NRG Yield. Through the first half of the year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.487 billion, approximately $1 billion from Wholesale, $281 million from Retail and $201 million from NRG Yield.","Turning to highlights. At the second quarter end, we successfully completed the first drop-down transaction with NRG Yield for the first 3 ROFO assets previously announced in the first quarter. This transaction resulted in $357 million in cash consideration, increasing capital available at the NRG level. NRG now intends to offer this quarter a second set of additional assets to NRG Yield, representing approximately $120 million in adjusted EBITDA and $35 million in annual cash available for distribution, or CAFD, allowing us to target closing the transaction and the resulting NRG capital replenishment by the end of this year. Over the past 2 weeks, NRG Yield successfully priced and closed its first-ever equity follow-on offering in an inaugural green bond offering resulting in approximately $1.1 billion in total net proceeds, not only fully funding the cash needs for the upcoming close of the Alta Wind transaction, but providing a significant capital surplus at NRG Yield, which can be used to fund future drop-downs. Finally, as Mauricio reviewed earlier, we have now completed our review of capital expenditures for the 4 Midwest Generation assets and plan to spend approximately $545 million in total to ensure not only environmental compliance, but efficient operations and long-term financial performance at these facilities. Approximately $130 million of the total capital spend from Midwest Gen will take place in 2014 and is already reflected in environmental CapEx in our free cash flow before growth investments guidance.","Turning to guidance on Slide 19. We are maintaining our guidance ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for 2014. However, absent above-average weather over the balance of the summer or colder weather later in the year, we expect our actual financial results for 2014 would be towards the lower end of these ranges. While our guidance range for Retail remains unchanged, we've made equal and offsetting changes to both Wholesale and NRG Yield guidance to reflect the impact of the successful completion of our first ROFO drop-down on June 30. Specifically, we're reducing the Wholesale component of guidance by $100 million with a corresponding increase to NRG Yield guidance. This shift in EBITDA is based on GAAP accounting requirements and reflects the full year contribution of the 3 ROFO assets to NRG Yield's financial results. We will follow this approach, which merely reflects the accounting impact to both historical results as well as guidance for each drop-down, regardless of when these transactions might close within a given year. Our EBITDA and free cash flow guidance also reflect the expected impact of our growing residential solar business. In total, the residential solar component of 2014 EBITDA contained within the Wholesale guidance is approximately $40 million in negative EBITDA. As I mentioned on our first quarter call, the residential solar business does not lend itself to traditional financial metrics such as EBITDA, which, largely, in that business, consist of customer acquisition and overhead expenses incurred in driving robust lease revenue growth in future periods, while current revenue is a function of leases previously placed in service. As the business grows and matures, we expect the positive cash flow from leases augmented by cross-selling benefits from the NRG Home platform will outpace expenses to deliver positive cash flow to NRG. We will be providing additional detail in the coming months on how we see this business adding to shareholder value, including our expectations for lease volume growth, plans for monetizing future cash flows to realize cash benefits on a more immediate basis, cross-selling opportunities, capital cost and net value to NRG.","Turning next to the liquidity update on Slide 20. NRG's total liquidity on a consolidated basis stands at approximately $3 billion as of June 30, 2014, prior to the impact of the excess proceeds from the NRG Yield equity and debt offerings following the quarter end, which we expect to contribute an additional $188 million to overall liquidity. During the second quarter, we continued our efforts to extend NRG unsecured debt maturities, while taking advantage of market opportunities to reduce overall interest cost on an opportunistic basis. NRG's issuance of $1 billion of 10-year senior notes permitted us to redeem approximately $780 million of our 2019 senior notes via tender offer during the past quarter, and we have subsequently issued a call notice to redeem the remaining $225 million of the 2019 notes. In addition to more than doubling the maturity versus the notes redeemed, this refinancing transaction will result in additional interest savings of $16 million annually, which, when combined with our successful refinancing of $400 million in the first quarter, represents approximately $25 million in total annual interest savings from refinancing transactions this year.","Subsequent to the quarter end, NRG Yield successfully completed its first follow-on equity offering, raising $630 million in net proceeds at a share price of $54, and just last week, Yield successfully completed its first-ever bond offering, a green bond, raising approximately $500 million in 10-year notes at a 5 3\/8% coupon. These 2 capital raises by NRG Yield generated approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds, which significantly exceeds the estimated $934 million cash funding needs for the Alta Wind transaction, which we expect will close this quarter. The resulting $188 million of additional surplus liquidity at NRG Yield can be used to support future growth, including NRG's planned offer to NRG Yield of a second group of assets this quarter.","Turning to an update on progress and intended timing of future drop-downs to NRG Yield on Slide 21. NRG intends to offer a second set of assets from the portfolio of NRG Yield eligible assets we acquired on April 1 for acquisition by NRG Yield later this quarter, building on the success of our first-ever drop-down and anticipated to further increase capital available at the NRG level. Specifically, during the quarter, we intend to offer NRG Yield Walnut Creek, a 500 megawatt natural gas-fired asset, under a 10-year capacity contract with Southern California Edison; Tapestry, a 200 megawatt portfolio of wind assets under 20-year contracts with various off-takers; and Laredo Ridge, an 81 megawatt wind asset also under a 20-year PPA. These assets, comprising approximately 800 megawatts in total, are expected to generate around $120 million in annual EBITDA and approximately $35 million in annual cash bill for distribution, bringing the total CAFD made available to NRG Yield by NRG from drop-downs to $65 million in 2014.","Following the second drop-down, which we are targeting to negotiate and close prior to year end, NRG still has NRG Yield eligible assets totaling approximately 1.3 gigawatts and representing an additional $100 million of CAFD and $215 million of adjusted EBITDA, which we intend to offer to NRG Yield over the course of the next 5 years, hoping to drive dividend growth at Yield, while continuing to replenish capital at NRG. Given the strong liquidity at Yield now augmented by the excess cash from recent offerings and our current equity ownership of approximately 55% following the recent equity issuance at Yield, we would expect a consideration to NRG for the second drop-down later this year to consist entirely of cash.","Finally, updating our capital allocation progress and plans on Slide 22. The excess cash proceeds from the NRG Yield debt and equity offerings serve to increase overall 2014 capital available for allocation by $188 million versus the prior quarter update. To date, we have allocated approximately $1.8 billion of 2014 available capital, $1.1 billion of which has been towards value-enhancing acquisitions such as Edison Mission, with the remainder balanced across debt repayment activities, which now includes the cost related to our successful unsecured refinancing at NRG earlier this year; return of shareholder capital via dividends; and reinvestment in optimizing our generation assets. The remaining $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion of available capital, which is important to remember is the projected number at the end of 2014 rather than the excess cash available right now, resides at 3 different levels of the consolidated capital structure for which we have different priorities based on the needs and opportunities at each level.","I've broken out these 3 levels at the bottom of the slide based on the midpoint of our total remaining excess cash across 2014. First, at GenOn, we expect to deploy approximately $440 million of the $650 million 2014 excess to fund completing the previously announced fuel conversions at Avon Lake and New Castle and our latest fuel conversion projects at Portland and Shawville, hoping to improve the future cash flow profile at GenOn. Turning to NRG Yield, we expect approximately $280 million in excess cash by year end, which can be used to help fund the purchase of the second set of drop-down assets I spoke about earlier, the total purchase price for which we increase capital dollar-for-dollar at the NRG level. Finally, at the NRG corporate level, where we expect the balance of $305 million and remaining excess cash, which would be augmented by drop-down proceeds, we continue to see potential opportunities on the M&A front, but expect this would be more likely taking the form of smaller bolt-on type transactions across all of our businesses rather than acquisitions from big conventional power plant portfolios. The remaining surplus capital provides potential base for our 2015 commitments, which include the majority of the capital spend for Midwest Gen optimization.","With that, I'll turn it back to David to move to Q&A.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Kirk. And Ben, I think that we used a lot of time, but I think we've got 15 or 20 minutes left for questions. So why don't we open the phones for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is actually Paul Zimbardo. Question on Slide 12, with the $545 million compliance plan, can you kind of share some background on your thoughts for where that splits up between those plants and just kind of what your thought process was on undertaking each plant's project.","David W. Crane","Mauricio, go ahead.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, so we took a couple of things in consideration. One of the gating items, clearly, was the capacity auction results from the '17, '18 auction, but more importantly, the previous 3 years that gave us some visibility and some comfort on the outlook that we have for the PJM market. For us, the value proposition for Powerton and Waukegan is to remain on call and make the investment on the back-end controls to comply with MATS and CPS. Joliet, clearly was a -- we cannot justify putting the back-end controls. We looked at which of these assets have better access to natural gas supply, and Joliet was the one that had the best location for that. And with respect to Will County, first, is the, I guess, justifying the environmental CapEx for Will County was just not possible under the current market conditions. We're moving forward to retire that Unit 3 on '15 and then we'll continue to operate Unit 4 so long it just -- it complies with MATS. But we did a comprehensive analysis of all the plants. We look at which ones could be converted to a different fuel. We took into consideration capacity and current market prices. We look at the spend optimization that we could do given the -- we did a pro forma benchmark analysis on all of these facilities to evaluate what fixed cost we could take out, and basically, this was a result of that entire analysis.","Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And do you have a timeline for the testing on Will County Unit 4?","David W. Crane","You mean, how long it can continue operating with -- do we have a specific timeline on it?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, we're looking at -- we're doing the testing, as we speak, right now. We believe that we will be in compliance for MATS and that's why we're laying it out for operation through 2018.","David W. Crane","Paul, I mean, I do want to just generally add to what Mauricio said. I mean NRG on the wholesale generation side, I've always thought that the best way to be in that market was with a fuel-diversified portfolio, and certainly, the lessons from the polar vortex this winter was having a fuel-diversified portfolio was definitely the way to go. So we've taken into account all that Mauricio mentioned, but we also -- we very much want to continue to be multi-fuel in all of our core markets because we think that's the best way to play constraints on the fuel side, whether -- particularly within natural gas, whether it be with the commodity itself or with the transportation in times of scarcity. So we think, both with the GenOn assets and now with the Midwest Gen assets that, that's sort of the overriding theme that we're trying to accomplish.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","You didn't mention anything about California. We saw in late July that San Diego Gas & Electric requested the approval for a PPA for your Carlsbad Energy Center. And also, we haven't really heard from SoCal Ed [ph] about their portion of gas-driven replacement for SONGS. Could you comment on your potential contracts there?","David W. Crane","Well, Angie, it's always best to -- we always like to promise things that we know we can deliver on it. We're very pleased with San Diego Gas & Electric's submission of the power purchase agreement. But if we were to comment on, we would have been commenting on when do we think it'll be approved by the California Public Utility Commission and predicting when government acts is something that we just don't get in the business of. But we're very excited about that project. We think it's a very good project for the state of California. We think it's a very good project, ultimately, for NRG Yield, and we look forward to the day that the California Public Utility Commission acts upon that PPA, so that we can continue to add to the stability of electricity supply in Southern California. As to the Southern California Edison procurement, I think that, adversely, everything that happens in the Southern California Edison procurement is subject to confidentiality agreements. So I think I would limit myself at this point to say we don't know when they will make decisions. I think it would be fair for you to assume that NRG was responsive to virtually every aspect of what Southern California Edison was looking for in their request for a proposal. And we'd actually be very excited to participate in both conventional generation and what I think they referred to as preferred resources. So you may have to ask them as to what their timing is, but certainly we're excited about it.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","So -- but SoCal Ed [ph] has made announcements about renewables. How much of gas-fired capacity are they trying to procure?","David W. Crane","I'm not sure I can answer that question, Angie. Let us -- we'll get a response back to you on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Dave, you wrote on your blog a bit about carbon and some of your thoughts there. I'm wondering if you could just apply that to Texas and give us at a high level your thoughts on the implications, if the EPA rule passes as is enacted as proposed, how you think about the implications for the Texas business. Obviously, Petra Nova is a great strategic step to consider that, but can you just talk more broadly about your Texas business in carbon?","David W. Crane","Well, I mean the first thing, which is -- I think it's fair to say we submitted comments to the EPA rule, and we don't think that the EPA rule is currently promulgated as fair, and we particularly think it's unfair to the Gulf States and to Texas. So I would start by saying my hope that the rule doesn't get promulgated exactly as it is today. If it does get promulgated, it sort of depends on where the price of carbon lays out to. It's clearly not good for the coal-fired plants in Texas. I'm not sure that there's a way for Texas to comply with the rule as provided without significant retirement on the coal side. What knock-on implications that has for a state that -- contrary to my sort of doom and gloom in my opening comments about how they're weakening fundamentals, sort of Texas is the exception with 300,000 people moving into Texas every year and all that. So I would definitely call a strain on the system from our perspective. I mean that's -- as you alluded to, that's why Petra Nova is such an important project because coal plants in the United States are getting to a point where it's very Darwin-istic, it's survival of the fittest. And if putting carbon capture on the back of Parish, which is our biggest coal plant in our entire fleet, I think it's the biggest coal plant or the second biggest coal plant in the entire country, if that can help Parish and certainly we've contemplated the same at Limestone, survive in a market where other plants are having to come offline, it should just add to the value of those plants. And so that's our strategy, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And shifting over to solar, it sounds like in the coming months, you'll speak more specifically to it. I wondered if you could just talk at a high level in terms of how competitive you see the playing field there. It looks like it's a very large addressable market and very small penetration rates. But just curious, as you look at both commercial and residential opportunities, does it -- do you often run into competitors? Is it relatively competitive? Or does it feel like the -- because the penetration level is so low, that the opportunity set's pretty rich?","David W. Crane","Yes, there's a lot there, Stephen. And you're right. For the most part, we're sort of trying to avoid too much discussion about our strategy and our implementation plan and the sort of distributed solar space until we're fully ready to go because it is a highly competitive market and it's a very fluid market right now. With the success that SolarCity has had in the -- basically on Wall Street, there's a lot of shaking out just within the residential solar space. So what I would say there -- and the market does actually divide quite neatly on that front, is that residential solar, it seems a lot like distributed solar in terms of business-to-business, but apart from the solar panel, it's really a completely different business. It's sold differently, it's financed differently and all that. And in our company, you'll be handled by 2 different parts of the company. So you're right, even though there's very little penetration, I think I don't -- I think SolarCity, who's obviously the biggest player in the field, is saying they're going to do 80,000 installations this year. That's in a market, an addressable market that's been estimated across 20 states as 16 million homes. And so while you do focus on the next guy more for sort of internal morale purposes, more than one company has room to succeed in the residential solar space, and certainly, we expect to be one of those companies. And like I said, we'll talk more about that in the future. For us, on the business-to-business side, Stephen, the key is how do you downsize and do a lot of projects quickly, and our focus in that area is because, the age-old maxim, a 1 megawatt project requires as much structuring as a 100 megawatt project. That applies in renewables, as well as in conventional. But what we're looking to do -- and we've announced sort of starter deals with Starwood and Unilever is sort of getting into a world of one customer, multiple projects. So our first deal with Starwood was 3 hotels within their chain, but it's not lost upon us or them that they have 1,200 hotels worldwide. So that's really our -- what we're focused on in the business-to-business side, and it's early days there, but we certainly hope to be very successful and have a lot to talk to you about in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra of TPH.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","On the Midwest Generation side, does the asset optimization include kind of all the synergies that you guys have looked at in the business? Or is there possibly more kind of cost reductions to make that imply the EV-to-EBITDA multiple look better?","Mauricio Gutierrez","No, I mean, we took a holistic view of the entire Midwest Generation portfolio, and it does include all the operational synergies from reducing fixed costs to the spend optimization initiative to field conversions and the current market conditions, given the outcome on the capacity auction and the recent dark spread. So I mean, it is a comprehensive look at the value proposition for Midwest Gen.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then with the Dominion retail customers, you mentioned that you're getting better-than-expected earnings and customer retention rate. Can you just outline the drivers behind that? What has kind of been the upside surprise?","David W. Crane","Neel, Elizabeth Killinger is going to answer that question for you.","Elizabeth Killinger","Yes, so we are seeing better-than-expected retention, in particular in our Northeast markets, driven probably by the experience they're having with the transition and that is that we're delivering on their commitments and giving them a warm welcome. On the earnings side, we attribute that to our effective margin management and understanding what the customer segments need to -- in order to stay with us. So we're real excited about that and look forward to that being a very successful integration over the coming months.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Cohen of ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Question, one of your competitors on their earnings call just announced a big new combined cycle project in PJM, and on current forward curves, it looks like it's a pretty decent return on equity near term. But given your view on how the power market is going to evolve with low demand and more distributed generation, is that something that you would ever consider, like putting that much money to work in baseload assets, 20-year life assets?","David W. Crane","Mauricio?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Look, I mean the way we understand the project, it's a brownfield development and it has a cost competitive advantage vis-\u00e0-vis a greenfield development project. So I think I said that the market in PJM is getting close to cost of new entry. We had very strong capacity results. Spark spreads have been trending closer to greenfield development. The one thing -- and you pointed it out, I mean these are investments that have gone over 25-, 30-year length -- in length. Clearly, one data point is not going to justify making that investment. What we're seeing is, we're just very constructive on the PJM market. We think margins and -- capacity prices and margins are more sustainable than what we may have heard from other folks, and that's why we also went ahead and did the investment on the Midwest Generation fleet.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And do you -- I mean, have you looked for similar sort of brownfield-type opportunities where you have some cost advantages for new build or...","David W. Crane","Jon, yes, I mean, look, I think in terms of building new power plants, our advantage -- I mean, we have more projects than anyone. I mean basically -- in fact, brownfield versus greenfield, I can't actually remember the last time that we actually looked at a greenfield. I guess it was the one in [indiscernible]. So we are looking at brownfield all the time, and we ask and expect through our regional organizations that every power plant that we have had sort of the best option for either repowering, renewal, and so we're all about brownfield. But every brownfield we've done, we take advantage of the cost advantage in brownfield just like our competitors because it's real. But I mean every one we've done in recent years has a long-term contract. I do think there would be opportunities to make money in terms of conventional wholesale generation in the future, but particularly in the Northeast, they're going to come up because there's going to be imbalances created when sort of too many plants like -- retire. And I think if you look at the history of the curve, cost of new entrant pricing is not reached as often as -- the peaks are much more limited than the valleys. And so when the peaks come, you pretty much have to be there with megawatts at that time. You can't sort of say, well, this is a good time for me to start permitting a plant and then take 3 years to build it. And so one of the things I like about the -- we're not -- certainly, as you know from today in terms of the investment in the Midwest Gen fleet, we are by no means starving the Wholesale side of our business from capital to sort of succeed over the next 20, 30 years. But in terms of even where the business is repositioning, one of the things I like about the Retail side of the business is the best earned is large in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars in a merchant plant, hoping that you'll be right over the next 30 years. So I very much like the balance of our capital allocation in terms of how we're investing sort of across from Wholesale to Retail.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a high-level question. It seems like over the last few years, NRG has kind of evolved and has become a very big and complex company, multifaceted and fingers in a lot of different pies. Do you worry that at some point, the company becomes too difficult to analyze or the story becomes too difficult to tell and that you start to turn off certain investors?","David W. Crane","Yes, I mean I think we were -- I mean I think that the -- I mean I think that's a different way of saying what I tried to say today is that, I mean the revelation for us for Yield, which we -- we struggled with the Yield idea for 2 years and worried about how the market would ever value our contracted solar assets, and we knew the market didn't pay any attention to our contracted assets, which I think, before Yield, consist of about 15% of our -- the market can only look at so many things. So even just within generation, they look at the 85% merchant exposure rather than the 15% contracted. So we actually think that while sort of the way we're organizing that was announced today may seem more complex, to us it simplifies the story, both from the investor's perspective but also from a management perspective. The way we're organized going forward allows senior executives of the team to sort of focus in their area and win in their area because each area is pretty distinct. I mean they're mutually reinforcing, but each has different competitors. And each -- as Kirk was going through, you can't value residential solar success on an EV-to-EBITDA basis. So we actually are very mindful of we want to get the benefits of having the multiplicity of assets and opportunities we have, but we want to simplify it for purposes of investment and value recognition, as well as value creation. So we're trying, Jon. And any advice you have on that, feel free to send us an email. Ben, we've gone past 10:00 and knowing it's August, I don't want to burn people too much, but we'll take 2 more calls if we can, and I'll try and be briefer in my answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a little bit of the puts and takes when we start thinking about capital spending for next year and maybe even for '16? What's different now than anything you've kind of previously disclosed? Just trying to kind of balance things up in terms of what's happening on the CapEx side for the next couple of years and what that means for free cash flow.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Well, first of all, we'll certainly provide you specific guidance around free cash flow in '15 as we normally do in the third quarter of the year. But looking ahead of that, which is why, as David talks about priorities and I, in answer, disclosure around exactly where that remaining capital resides, and as I said, those priorities are a little different. I think how it's evolved is we're much more focused on the future of the business, not ignoring opportunities to continue to enhance generation. But as we've said, the capital allocation focus is going to be on kind of smaller bolt-on -- bias towards a smaller bolt-on acquisition side as far as M&A is concerned. And the capital spend, certainly, we're mindful of, in the relatively near term, rounding out and completing the capital spend for Midwest Gen optimization and also the expanded asset optimization from the GenOn portfolio I spoke to you before. So I think we're much more focused on the future of NRG, especially around NRG Home on the Retail side, that's a small bolt-on acquisition, and just completing the optimization plans as we move forward.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I think about what's happening on just CapEx and not total capital allocation, but just -- and I know this is just kind of one narrow window of it, but it seems that there's what could be a pretty decent and material uptake in CapEx in 2015 and maybe 2016 on the existing fleet before things start kind of coming back down in the 2017 and beyond time frame. I mean, I'm just trying to -- I think about maintenance capital then the CapEx on Edison Mission, really the Midwest Gen units, as well as some of the work Big Cajun related and then things could -- should kind of tail off. Am I kind of just directionally thinking about that right?","Kirkland B. Andrews","I think you're thinking about it exactly right. I mean in 2015 and 2016, it would represent the bulk of that remaining largely environmental CapEx, and in addition, that environmental CapEx is actually, as you know, above the line in terms of what we define as free cash flow and then obviously allocating it towards the operational improvements we spoke about before. So I think the capital intensity on that front is really most acutely focused in those 2 years, '15 and '16.","David W. Crane","Well -- and Kirk, asking Michael's next question for him, I mean, but -- and even between '15 and '16, with the real focus, the blip that Michael's referring to actually being driven by this Midwest Gen and the -- and even finishing off the GenOn asset management, I mean that's much more '15 and '16, isn't that right?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, the bulk of that, especially on Midwest Gen, is certainly in '15 and then it begins to tail off a little bit more in '16, yes.","David W. Crane","Yes.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Gregg Orrill of Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So on the Joliet repowering and synergies on the Midwest Gen portfolio, the $120 million of asset optimization, et cetera, how much of that is the Joliet conversion in there? And then I had one other question.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, I mean I would say that we're not going to break out the overall $545 million across individual assets. But obviously, that $545 million, within that number is the smaller subset that we previously committed to as part of the PoJo leases. So that obviously conforms to what we committed to the lease holders, therefore, Powerton and Joliet as well.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So a decent share of the $100 million to $120 million?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes. I mean I would say it's relatively ratable across those, but I'm not going to break out the asset optimization impact that comes off of that on an individual asset basis.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe the elephant in the room a little bit, just in terms of the capital allocation, just following up there. You didn't mention anything about a buyback of any size. How are you thinking about that?","David W. Crane","Well, I think the way we're thinking about that right now, and it sort of goes back to Michael's -- the answer to Michael's question is, as we look forward in the immediate future, we see a need for available capital that we think have greater long run value than share buyback. We have a record of doing a lot of share buybacks over the last 10 years and so -- I think 7, in fact, in the 10 years that I've been here. So we'll come back to that issue in 2015, but I think for now we -- or the capital allocation is going to be pretty much like laid out by Kirk at the end of his -- of the presentation.","Anyway, Ben, thank you very much, and I appreciate everyone taking the time, and sorry, we went 10 minutes over, but enjoy the rest of your summer, and we'll look forward to talking to you in the fall.

However, with the unabated selloff in our stock and across the entire sector during the quarter, I want to begin by acknowledging how difficult a time it has been for you, our shareholders.","In truth, in this market environment, I don't know that I can predict what exactly will cause the stock to turn around and recover to some level that approximates fair value, but I can tell you that NRG's operational and financial performance has been strong and solidly within expectations, that our current liquidity is as strong it has ever been at over $4 billion, and that our Reset program has passed through the planning stage into implementation with every aspect of it well on track, albeit still in the early going.","It is certainly our hope and expectation that's a gradual accomplishment of various aspects of the reset, the cost-cutting, the freeing up of committed capital through various measures, the allocation of capital particularly to the reduction of debt, all will provide a continuous impetus to the recovery of our share price. And after that preliminary comment, let's move on to discuss how our business has performed through the third quarter of 2015.","Turning to slide three in the business update, I'm pleased to report today that we are narrowing our 2015 full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, solidly in the middle of the original guidance range. Our financial performance in the ever-important third quarter was just tremendous, and demonstrated once again the resilience of having a matched retail-wholesale platform. In a period of subdued wholesale power prices, our retail business, alongside our outstanding commercial operations team, excel. Indeed, our retail business delivered its best quarterly result since 2010, with $225 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.","Regarding our conventional wholesale business, which by the way turned in another strong operational quarter, probably the most noteworthy event during the quarter has been the extensive commentary in the financial community questioning the medium- to long-term prospects for power plant fleets like ours. My reaction to this point, based on the many commodity price cycles I have live through in this industry, is that you can't ignore the underlying reliability value of locationally advantaged assets in competitive markets. Our 48,000 megawatt fleet has a key competitive advantage in each of our three regional markets.","First, in Texas, our generation portfolio's footprint closely matches and complements our thriving Texas retail business. Second, in the East, our portfolio has been shaped to focus on providing and being compensated for reliable capacity, as demonstrated by the enhanced value in earnings to NRG as a result of the recent capacity performance auction, and the importance of which has been underlined by the recent announcement of Entergy with respect to the closure of the FitzPatrick plant. And third in the West, our portfolio features a heavily contracted Fast-Start gas capability tailored to a market moving towards 50% renewables. In all three of our regional markets, the steady and stable operations of our generation remains critical, not only to the enterprise, but to the grid in general.","Moving on to other signs of successful execution of our business plan, I'm pleased to announce today that just yesterday, we closed our most recent drop-downed NRG yield, which delivered $210 million in cash back to NRG, which as you know we will be utilizing as part of our efforts to strengthen the balance sheet as we discussed on our last call.","I'm also pleased to report that, as we announced on September 22, we successfully executed on the $251 million share repurchase program, which in combination with all shares repurchased year-to-date brings the total shares acquired this year to 7% of our outstanding shares. And as we will discuss in more detail in a bit, we are now shifting our immediate capital allocation focus to debt reduction, as we indicated would be the case on our NRG Reset call, as a way not only to further strengthen our balance sheet but also to unlock shareholder value.","Lastly, our Home Solar business remains well on track, as we outlined six weeks ago, driven by tremendous top line growth with over 6,300 net bookings in the quarter, and we believe one of the highest, if not the highest growth rate of the major players in the sector. This volume places us in a fight for third with Sunrun and not that far off from Vivint in the number two position.","With respect to our installations for the quarter, which numbered 1,900, or now a total of approximately 80 megawatts, we are making progress in our concerted effort to reduce the backlog going into and through the early months of 2016. For those tracking Home Solar's negative EBITDA contribution projected for full-year 2015 continues to track within the negative $175 million disclosed on the second quarter call.","So, let's move on to discuss progress on the NRG Reset and drivers behind our 2016 financial guidance, turning to slide 4. Let me start with components of the Reset which are fully within our control. We are well into the implementation phase of our companywide cost reduction program of $150 million across G&A, marketing and development expense. In addition, and Mauricio will provide more details on this, I'm also pleased to announce today that we have identified and are implementing an additional $100 million in O&M spending reductions across all of our businesses, all of which can be done in a manner that does not sacrifice the reliability of our portfolio. So when combined with the initial NRG Reset cost reduction plan, our cost reduction efforts now bring, on an annual basis, a total cost savings target of $250 million to be achieved in 2016 and recurring thereafter.","On the asset rebalancing component of the program, we remain focused on and highly confident in our ability to unlock, in combination with the cost reduction program, over $1 billion in capital for allocation to reduce the balance sheet. The modifications of our plans at Portland and Avon Lake Unit 9 are complete, reducing or eliminating additional capital spend at those plants, and we are actively marketing select assets for disposition. Given the high level of interest in these assets expressed during our preliminary marketing phase over the past few weeks, we are moving forward at a pace and in a manner that we believe will lead to an optimization of value for NRG shareholders. You should expect in all likelihood a series of such transaction announcements over the weeks and months to come.","Regarding the GreenCo business, the $125 million GreenCo runway around NRG Home Solar, the C&I business at NRG Renew, and eVgo is established, and ready to commence on January 1, 2016. As it relates to the process around the securing of a strategic or financial partner in GreenCo, through the initial phase of our efforts we are quite pleased with the interest we are seeing. We continue to be in the market discovery process and remain focused on selling a majority interest in GreenCo with the goal of financial deconsolidation and simplification at the parent company level.","However, and not unlike our approach to asset dispositions on the conventional side, our approach with respect to GreenCo is value first and speed of execution second. The choice of partner in at GreenCo is an important one and we are focused on both optimizing current value and positioning the business, which NRG will continue to own a significant stake in for future success. We will provide you with more material updates as the process allows.","So as we look at all the actions we are taking, and importantly marry this with the ongoing benefit of our integrated platform, we are introducing 2016 financial guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth on a consolidated basis. As an additional item and something Kirk will provide more detail around, in response to many of the questions we are receiving from investors pertaining to the complexity of our capital structure, for the first time we are now providing our expectation for free cash flow before growth at the NRG level. What this represents is the free cash flow generation excluding non-recourse subsidiaries such as GenOn, NRG Yield, and the primary NRG ROFO assets. Our hope is that providing this to you, we will eliminate at least part of the concern about the geography of our cash flows.","Now turning to slide five, I would like to touch upon capital allocation. We have repeatedly stated over the past few months that our focus over the coming year is on shrinking the balance sheet, so for the avoidance of doubt, let me put our thinking in this regard into some historical context. For many years now, indeed for almost my entire time as CEO of NRG, our focus has been to establish a diversified business platform that reduces our company's exposure to near-term fluctuations in natural gas and power prices, amongst other potentially concentrated risks.","Specifically, our goal always has been to minimize commodity price impact on free cash flow, while maintaining the upside that occurs when the commodity markets move in a positive direction. Our key tool in this regard, in addition to hedging, has been asset and business diversification. Our diversification commenced in earnest when we entered the retail business six years ago through the acquisition of Reliant, followed with our strong move into contracted generation targeted around renewables, our redevelopment efforts that are locationally advantaged Brownfield sites, and most recently our asset management program aimed at maximizing our economic advantage in capacity markets like PJM.","This quarter's performance, especially with our outstanding retail performance, and next year's guidance, coming as they do at a time of historically low natural gas prices, speaks to the effectiveness of our business diversification as a financial buffer. But of course, this diversification becomes a moot point if market concerns around the balance sheet persist. It is our strongly held belief that NRG's equity investors will benefit from an absolute reduction in our debt, most notably at the NRG level, but also across our entire capital structure. As Kirk will outline, that is the focus of our capital allocation program now.","At this slide five describes, as a result of our recent efforts, we aim to free up roughly $1.6 billion in total over the next 14 months to apply to balance sheet shrinking, and particularly to debt reduction. Further, as we look out beyond the next 14 months, our efforts around reducing maintenance CapEx and the material completion of our capital expenditure program will provide further capital allocation flexibility. Our overriding goal that animates this entire effort is to put to rest the question of whether NRG is carrying an excessive level of debt, so that all of us can be on the same plane where we can focus on the cash generative power of the NRG businesses and how that cash can be put to its best use for the benefits of NRG shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Our integrated platform continued to perform extremely well during the third quarter. Our wholesale business mitigated the impact of lower power prices through active hedging and good commercial execution, while our retail business benefited from lower supply costs, highlighting once again the strength of our wholesale-retail platform.","During the quarter, we continued to take steps on repositioning our portfolio to optimize and improve economics and returns. First, our asset optimization effort in the Northeast, which focuses on capacity revenues, was validated by the recent PJM capacity performance auction resource (15:07). Second, we continue to reduce spend across the fleet, which I will discuss in more detail in a later slide. And finally, we have taken the necessary steps to hedge our portfolio in the short term to protect from further downside. All of these efforts are in addition to the business diversification strategy that David already mentioned in his remarks.","So let's start with a review of our operational performance on slide seven. We have another quarter of top-quartile safety performance, with 147 out of 168 facilities that finished the quarter without a single recordable injury. We're mindful that our portfolio is going through some changes and we need to stay vigilant and redouble our efforts to ensure that safety is and remains always first. Our total generation was up 5% for the quarter, driven primarily by higher generation in the Gulf and the West.","The East was relatively unchanged, with slightly lower coal generation offset by higher gas runs. Our coal and nuclear plants improved their availability and reliability metrics. I want to congratulate STP, Parish, and Dunkirk for almost perfect runs this summer. Our gas units continue to be called on more frequently in the market, as you can see in the bottom right chart. We continue to maintain a remarkable 99% starting reliability on our gas (16:27).","Turning to slide eight, our retail business continued its trend of exceptional performance, delivering $225 million of adjusted EBITDA, the highest third quarter since 2010 and $58 million more than last year. During the quarter, we captured value from lower cost to serve, effective margin management, and expansion of our product offering. We have also sustained our strong momentum in customer acquisition and retention that led to 5,000 customer account growth, despite the continued expiration of acquired Dominion customers' contracts in the East, where we continued to see better than expected retention levels. Excluding the Dominion acquisition, our customer growth was 26,000.","As we have stated in the past six years, the ongoing success of our retail business continues to demonstrate the value of our integrated wholesale-retail platform, and most importantly provides NRG diversification in earnings through all phases of the commodity cycle.","Turning to slide nine. Let me share a few comments on the gas market. We have experienced pretty mild weather this past year, a warm winter followed by a mild summer. This weather combination most likely will lead to a new record storage number in the coming weeks, at or near 4 TcF. Combined with the expectation of an El Ni\u00f1o weather forecast, and you've got a market with only bearish news and falling prices. It's worth noting that El Ni\u00f1o is typically associated with a warmer upper Midwest winter and a colder Gulf Coast one. As a diversified energy company with assets in both areas, we could do well in such a scenario.","I want to remind everyone that we're very well hedged through 2016 and about 50% in 2017, giving us some nice runway to what we see as a more bullish future. Make no mistake, where we see plenty of upside if gas prices were to rise, but have protected significantly the downside through hedging and business diversification. Regardless of current sentiment, in our view, long term natural gas price fundamentals look strong.","The first half of this decade was dominated by supply growth outstripping demand. We expect the second half to reverse that trend with demand growth outstripping supply. Natural gas production has been stagnant since late last year, in part because of lower rig counts and low prices. In the meantime we see growing LNG exports, increasing exports to Mexico, higher industrial production, and greater demand from the power sector. As an example, our fuel conversions of new gas flow from Joliet and Shawville alone will increase our summer peak day gas consumption by 0.5 BCF\/day. The gas demand from new builds and conversions is real and is coming. Simply put, we are well positioned to weather the short-term low prices and remain open to benefit from bullish long-term fundamentals.","Turning to slide 10, on our power market update, and starting with ERCOT. As we have discussed for several years now, market changes are needed to better reflect scarcity conditions like the ones we experienced this summer. During August, we saw our first real test of the operating reserve demand curve mechanism, and sadly, we watched it fail. Scarcity conditions were right for a few days, during which a new record peak was set. But aside from one $350 day head clear (19:56), the week was mostly disappointing. A combination of scarcity conditions and low prices caught both market participants' and the PUCT's attention. ORDC is expected to be a major topic of conversation at the open meeting tomorrow.","Discussions are now underway to examine potential changes that can be made to the ORDC parameters to make it more effective in reflecting true scarcity on the system. We're supportive of that effort and will actively participate in the discussion. Otherwise fundamentals remain strong, with load growing by 2.7% on a weather-normalized basis so far this year, despite low oil prices. Combined with the risk of additional retirements, current forward prices look too low and present an upside to our low-cost and environmentally controlled coal portfolio.","As for the Northeast, we have been repositioning our portfolio from providing base-load energy to providing reliability as a capacity resource. The recent results in PJM and New England, which we just covered in our recent call, validate our commercial strategy. In the past couple of weeks, we've heard news of additional nuclear retirements. It would seem that smaller nuclear plants are struggling to cover cost and may lead the way to further tightening in the market.","Turning to our hedging disclosure on a slide 11, and as I mentioned earlier today, we're pretty well hedged for the next two years. As the chart in the upper left of the slide shows, we're very well hedged against our expected production for 2016 and almost 50% hedged for 2017. We are evaluating further entry points to increase our coal hedges, and are comfortable with current inventory levels as we head into the winter months. We like the remaining open position for the back half of 2017 and beyond, given our more constructive view of gas and power.","Finally, on slide 12 I want to provide more details on our expanded cost reduction program across the company, and more specifically the $100 million reduction in O&M savings that David mentioned. As you likely have assumed, most of these will be executed on the wholesale business, where we continue our work on evaluating and prioritizing every actionable spend decision on an asset-by-asset basis.","Key drivers of the overall reduction relate to the asset optimization efforts that we announced around Portland and Huntley respectively, changes in the way we're managing operational risks and further cost reductions on units that have lower capacity factors. Of course, we will not make any O&M reductions that jeopardize the safe and efficient operations of our fleet.","In addition to the $100 million reduction just announced, we're introducing the fourth iteration of NRG's continuous business improvement program, called FORNRG. This program is driven by employee ideas and innovation to enhance each department's bottom line. The FOR stands for focus on return, and is rooted in ensuring all employees are empowered to find better, more cost-effective ways on doing our jobs. Our goal is to achieve $150 million of cumulative EBITDA over the next three years. Just as we have done in the past, we remain committed to our continuous improvement program that has yielded so many benefits for NRG and its shareholders.","With that, I will turn it over to Kirk.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Thank you, Mauricio. And beginning with the financial summary on slide 14, NRG delivered a total of $1.145 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter, and over $2.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30. Our third quarter results were highlighted by $225 million in adjusted EBITDA from Home Retail, a 35% year-over-year increase, again highlighting the success of NRG's integrated business model as results improved largely due to favorable supply cost.","Business and Renew combined for $722 million in EBITDA for the quarter, while NRG Yield contributed $198 million. Despite the subdued summer power prices, our strong Home Retail performance combined with effective wholesale hedging allows us to narrow our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion, still in line with the midpoint of our original 2015 guidance.","Looking to the business segment components of adjusted EBITDA guidance, the increase in guidance for NRG Yield reflects the full-year impact of the closing of the wind portfolio drop down as required under GAAP, with an equal reduction in Business and Renew guidance, which previously included the EBITDA associated with the equity stake now held by Yield. Based on the strong retail performance for the quarter, we are also increasing the retail component of 2015 EBITDA guidance, which offsets the modest reduction in expected 2015 wholesale results. Finally, we're also narrowing guidance for 2015 free cash flow to $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion.","Turning to other highlights, and focusing first on our progress on NRG Yield drop downs, we're pleased to announce we've now closed the previously announced sale of a 75% interest in a portfolio of 12 wind projects to NRG Yield for $210 million in cash. The remaining 25% interest continues to be part of the drop down pipeline remaining under the expanded right of first offer agreement.","NRG intends to complete the balance of the $100 million in commercial distributed solar projects and $150 million in residential solar leases under our existing partnerships with NRG Yield over the balance of 2015 and into early 2016. As we've indicated in previous quarters, NRG also intends to offer its remaining stake in CBSR to NRG Yield in late 2015, which makes up the balance of the $600 million in expected drop down offers to Yield during 2015, as originally announced on our first quarter earnings call.","Turning to share repurchases, NRG completed the purchase of $251 million of its common stock during September and October of 2015, which when combined with our previously completed share repurchases and annualized dividend leads to a total of approximately $630 million in capital returned to NRG common stockholders in 2015, and a 7% reduction in common shares outstanding.","Turning to 2016 guidance on slide 15, we're initiating 2016 guidance ranges with adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion and $3.2 billion, consisting of business and utility-scale renewable adjusted EBITDA of $1.545 billion to $1.67 billion, retail adjusted EBITDA of $650 million to $725 million, which is a $50 million increase over our initial 2015 retail guidance. And finally, NRG Yield adjusted EBITDA of $805 million, which includes the recently closed wind drop downs. Our free cash flow before growth guidance, which is net of maintenance and environmental capital, is expected to be a robust $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Our 2016 guidance excludes the impact of the GreenCo businesses as identified during our Reset call on September 18, for which NRG's total cash committed is limited to $125 million, which will be managed through an intercompany revolving credit facility as part of NRG 2016 capital allocation, which I will review in greater detail shortly.","As David mentioned earlier, to further clarify the cash flow and capital available at the NRG level, we are also initiating guidance for the portion of our total free cash flow before growth guidance, which is available at the NRG level, which for 2016 we expect to be $750 million to $950 million. This range is based on deducting the portion of our total free cash flow guidance expected to be generated at NRG's non-guarantor subsidiaries, which consist primarily of GenOn, NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets. And then finally, adding back the expected cash distributions and dividends from these subsidiaries makes up the adjustment to arrive at NRG level free cash flow before growth.","Turning to slide 16, and continuing the theme of clarifying and enhancing our disclosures, in light of increasing questions and focus from our investors on leverage levels at NRG, I have provided here a deconstructed view of the consolidated balance sheet, as well as the derivation of the NRG corporate debt to corporate EBITDA ratio, which is the cornerstone of our targeted prudent balance sheet metrics.","As you recall, we target this ratio at 4.25 times, which is consistent with our targeted BB credit metrics, recently reaffirmed by S&P. Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance and previously committed debt reduction from 2015, we are in line with that target.","As shown on the left of the slide, although NRG's consolidated debt balance as of the quarter end is approximately $20 billion, over $11 billion of that debt resides at our excluded project subsidiaries, which consist primarily of NRG Yield and the remaining ROFO assets, most of the debt at which is fully amortized and consistent with the contract durations, with the remaining non-recourse debt residing at GenOn.","This debt is non-recourse to NRG and is not counted in our corporate credit metrics, including the debt-to-EBITDA ratio prescribed by our credit facilities, which contain thresholds governing our ability to purchase shares and pay dividends. Only the remaining $8.8 billion of debt consisting of our senior unsecured notes and term loan facility is recourse to NRG and counts toward this ratio.","On the right of the slide, after adjusting for the $500 million in 2015 capital already allocated to NRG-level debt reduction, which we expect to augment using 2016 capital, we anticipate corporate debt, or the numerator of the ratio, to be less than $8.3 billion in 2016. Turning to corporate EBITDA, or the denominator of the targeted ratio, we began with the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance. As only cash distributions from our excluded project subsidiaries count as EBITDA for ratio purposes, we next deduct the midpoint 2016 EBITDA from these subsidiaries, and then add back these cash distributions, which include our share of dividends from NRG Yield and distributions and payments from the remaining nonrecourse subsidiaries, primarily the remaining ROFO assets.","The final adjustment is an add-back of non-cash components of corporate level expenses, which we're deducting in arriving at our EBITDA guidance. What results is $1.95 billion of corporate-level EBITDA, which basically represents EBITDA from assets and businesses from our recourse subsidiaries, plus the cash distributions and payments from nonrecourse subs. Based on the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, our expected corporate debt-to-EBITDA is no greater than 4.26 times, in line with our long-term target for this ratio and significantly below both our restricted payment and default ratios.","As I mentioned earlier, we expect to augment our 2015 allocation of capital to debt reduction, with additional debt reduction using 2016 capital driving this ratio even lower and providing additional balance sheet strengthening as we move into 2017. We remain committed to shrinking the NRG balance sheet as part of the NRG Reset, and leaving no doubt as to the strength and integrity of NRG credit ratios as we move into 2016 and beyond.","Turning to slide 17, having initiated 2016 guidance, I'd like to next review NRG-level capital available for allocation for 2016. We are focused here on capital allocation at the NRG level, which excludes NRG Yield excess cash as well as GenOn excess cash reserve for liquidity and the completion of our asset optimization project at GenOn.","Moving from left to right, we have now allocated all remaining 2015 capital towards debt reduction, which we expect to execute over the balance of 2015 into 2016, totaling $500 million in discretionary debt reduction at NRG. This balance consists of $200 million, which is one-third of the targeted 2015 NRG Yield drop down proceeds, plus $300 million of remaining capital also announced as part of the NRG Reset in September, which we are now committing to debt reduction as well.","Turning to 2016, incremental NRG level capital for allocation begins with the midpoint of our NRG-level free cash flow guidance of $850 million. Total 2016 committed capital at NRG is approximately $600 million, as shown in the red bar, and is comprised of the $125 million GreenCo runway revolver; growth investments of $250 million, primarily our PH Robinson peaker project, Carbon 360, and the eVgo California settlement; with the balance allocated to NRG-level corporate debt amortization and our common stock dividend.","The remaining free cash flow balance of $250 million, combined with $500 million of 2015 capital remaining to be deployed towards debt reduction, leads to $750 million in capital available at the NRG level through 2016, which we expect to further supplement through the execution of the remainder of the NRG Reset initiatives.","These initiatives include non-recourse project financing, through which we expect to fund approximately $250 million of environmental CapEx at Midwest generation, thereby increasing capital available to NRG. Having now completed the rating process and documentation for this financing, we are prepared to launch when market conditions are more favorable. Targeted asset sale proceeds from the NRG Reset totaling at least $500 million are expected to further augment excess capital for consolidated balance sheet reduction.","Finally, and potentially supplemental to the $1.1 billion in Reset capital, any proceeds from the GreenCo sell down and future NRG yield drop downs, located currently by equity market recovery, which serve to further expand NRG level capital for allocation. By way of reference, in the upper right corner of the page I have provided a walk, beginning with the remaining 2016 excess NRG-level free cash flow through the other components of the NRG Reset, which combined now total $1.1 billion in consolidated 2016 capital to be deployed toward shrinking the balance sheet.","Finally, turning to slide to 18, I'd like to briefly review and update our expectations for significant reductions in maintenance, environmental, and growth capital from 2016 to 2017. Our revised 2016 capital expenditures reflect reductions in growth CapEx, stemming primarily from the $100 million in reduced spend on fuel conversions at GenOn as well as GreenCo-related growth CapEx, which is now capped at $125 million based on the runway amount.","Turning to 2017, due to incremental reductions in expected 2017 growth capital expenditures, including the elimination of distributed-generation solar and residential solar, we now expect a year-over-year reduction of over $550 million in consolidated CapEx in 2017 versus 2016, with approximately $350 million of this reduction occurring at the NRG level.","These substantial year-over-year reductions in expected capital expenditures provide a significant cushion against continued softness in commodity prices and a potential uplift in available capital in 2017, which may be allocated to further balance sheet reductions, including debt reduction and return of shareholder capital.","With that, I'll turn it back to David.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kirk. And if we turn to our closing slide, which is slide 20, we end by quantifying a point previously made, which is that NRG's financial results in 2016 are not nearly as exposed to fluctuating gas prices as the market seems to be suggesting. We have successfully mitigated the downward exposure of falling natural gas prices through our hedging program and through our asset diversification.","In the ultra-low commodity price environment that currently grips our market, this strategy is what has enabled us today to guide to a healthy adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow level for 2016, and which, together with the substantially increased capital flexibility arising out of the steps listed on the right side of this page, should enable us to implement a substantial capital allocation program over the months ahead.","Our goal in all this is to make NRG a simpler, less leveraged company over the duration of the Reset program. NRG is not just an IPP. As we have demonstrated on this call, NRG's unique advantage is that our balanced wholesale-retail business mitigates the financial impact of low energy commodity prices, which enables us to profitably serve our retail customers with a growing mix of products and services. This is essential during the current low commodity price cycle, when the value pendulum in the sector clearly has swung to serving the end-use energy customer. As I said, this wholesale-retail balance is NRG's unique advantage, and all of us at NRG are excited about the opportunities we have in front of us to maximize the value of this advantage for the benefit of NRG shareholders.","And with that, Liz, we are happy to take people's questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the enhanced disclosure, it's extremely helpful, very well done. Just on, hit on the couple topics on, first on just coal supply, Just given the very low commodity environment we're in, very low gas and power prices, could you talk a little bit further to just what you're seeing in terms of potential ability, whether it'd be on transport or the commodity itself \u2013 what are the dynamics, in terms of being able to continue to improve your position in terms of your coal costs?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Stephen, you want to tell us the two questions, so \u2013 and then we'll answer them. So we're tipped off and we can prepare an answer to the second?","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure thing. My other question is just on competitive dynamics in retail. And I was curious whether you're seeing overall any competitive dynamic changes in that business, and then more specifically whether you see a potential for some of your retail competitors to try to get into solar, as you've been doing?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Into solar, not into -- not IPPs getting into retail, but you're interested in ...","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","In retailer to solar.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's right.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let me start by answering the last part of that question, and then Chris Moser's going to answer your coal question, and Elizabeth, as soon as Chris finishes, you answer the question about competitive dynamics in retail. But I would say, Stephen, given the market's reception to us getting into distributor \u2013 so I don't think that's going to encourage other IPPs to get into that area. But, so \u2013 but in terms of the other IPPs getting into retail, which is something that I've sort of been expecting for a long time, maybe Elizabeth can talk about that in terms of the context of competitive dynamics. But \u2013 but Chris, why don't you start with talking about the coal dynamics, and Elizabeth, you take over from Chris.","Christopher S. Moser - Senior Vice President-Commercial Operations","Sure. I would characterize it like this, Stephen. I think we're working with our whole coal supply chain and the partners in it to make sure we've got reliable and competitively priced fuel. There's really two pieces to that. There's the rail piece and then the commodity piece. I mean on the commodity side, if you've been watching over the past couple of weeks, we've seen a pretty decent jog down in the prices, specifically PRB, but NAZ (40:36) as well, and so that will obviously help us next year. And then on the transportation side, without getting into too much specifics, I would say that our transportation partners have been good partners with us and want to make sure that the coal continues to flow. So, I think that's how I would answer that.","Elizabeth Killinger - SVP & President, NRG Retail, NRG Energy, Inc.","And Stephen, regarding the competitive dynamics in the retail business, I think we continue to see intense competitive markets with \u2013 we're 50 players in Texas, and it varies by market in the East, but anywhere from kind of 15 to 30-something competitors. So, lots of competitive activity. We are seeing competitors extend their product offerings to include more products than simply retail electricity, and that takes the form of energy management solutions, natural gas, some home-control type features; as you noticed, home solar, and otherwise. So, we expect that to continue, which is why we continue to lead the market in evaluating what consumers want, and making sure we're delivering the best of it to them.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much \u2013 sorry, David.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Steve, I just, I guess my reaction on your people going into solar, response a little flippant about IPPs; what I think \u2013 and look, no one can predict the future, but I think the period ahead in home solar is going to be focused on consolidation around what I think is going to emerge as the four main players, the Solar Cities, the Vivints, the Sunruns, and ourselves. I don't expect another IPP to come into that space anytime soon, but I would actually be surprised, since \u2013 and, I'm \u2013 I subscribe to the view that home solar is a mortal threat to the utility business model. I would be surprised if, within the next 18 to 24 months, some big utility doesn't try and buy their way into this space, but that's just my speculation.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys. Just on that update to the balance sheet, what target metrics do you guys want to get to at the corporate NRG balance sheet perspective, and of the $1.6 billion that you are expecting between now and the end of the next year for debt reduction? Is that all NRG-specific debt, or is that going to include some GenOn and some other pieces in that number?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Sure, Dan. It's Kirk. I'll take that in reverse order. The $1.6 billion is really a consolidated look at uplift in capital for allocation. As you know, in particular, $500 million of that is what is part of the NRG Reset in asset sales, and depending on the mix of those asset sales \u2013 some of which we expect to be at the GenOn level, because we're focused on the Northeast \u2013 that, more than anything else, would govern the proportion of the allocation of capital toward debt reduction at GenOn versus NRG.","As to the targeted metric, we continue to target, as I'd said, 4.25 times corporate debt to corporate EBITDA. We also focused on FFO to debt, keeping that number below the \u2013 at or below the high-teens level. And I'd say that the tertiary component of that is, we look to stay around 50% debt-to-capital, though that is a book ratio. Certainly something that we focused on, the rating agencies focused on, but I think it's probably certainly tertiary to those first two.","And so \u2013 and part of the reason why we focused on that 4.25 is, as I said, it comports with what, based on our ongoing conversations with the rating agencies, support those BB credit metrics. It also gives us a significant cushion against the thresholds in our credit facility, above which we're no longer permitted to pay dividends or buy back stock. So we've got a significant cushion there, and obviously even further cushioned below the default ratio. So those are the reasons that go into those target metrics.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess just on capital allocation, can you remind us, with all the resets, what growth CapEx commitments you guys have beyond 2015? And then maybe along those capital allocation lines, how you think about, is there going to be room for buy-backs next year, or is this all going to be debt related?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Well, to answer the first part of that question, in terms of committed growth capital, as I think we've laid out, as we move into 2016, what we're seeing in terms of the growth capital on a consolidated basis is primarily the completion of the GenOn repowerings, as well as the \u2013 and beyond 2017, the beginning of the capital allocated to our Carlsbad and Mandalay projects, and the balance of that capital in 2016 and a little bit further into 2017 is just, A, the remainder of the Carbon 360 project, which has about $150 million of capital left to go in about equal parts between 2016 and 2017, and the eVgo California settlement, which in both 2016 and 2017 is at or about $20 million in each year. That is really the bulk; that is all of the remaining growth capital that we have or expect to allocate at this point.","As to the allocation of capital toward the balance sheet and your comment about share repurchases, what I would say is, as I'd mentioned, we're continuing to focus on finding opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Certainly our dividend is something we're committed to, and certainly we look to supplement that with share repurchases, but at the present time we are going to focus in swinging the pendulum towards the debt side of the balance sheet. In particular to leave no doubt, and to ensure not only that ratio is improved in 2016, but we are confident in our ability to maintain that ratio through 2017.","I think that more than anything else will determine our focus in the near term on debt reduction, and ultimately arriving at that ratio through that debt reduction will govern the proportion of our capital allocation which would later go to share repurchases.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yeah. So if I'm looking at slide 17, just to be clear, thinking about the capital allocation beyond the $500 million, since the CapEx savings is coming at GenOn and a portion of the asset sales will probably be at GenOn, we should think about sort of $250 million, maybe plus or minus \u2013 plus whatever portion of the asset sales are non-GenOn, as being pointed at debt reduction at the parent, incremental to the $500 million in 2016, is that correct?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","I think the way you've categorized that, Greg, is right, although certainly we \u2013 as I've said, we're focused near-term in allocating that capital towards debt reduction. So I'd be hesitant to say prescriptively all of it, but for right now that's certainly where we are definitely focused. And the way you describe that in terms of the geography, yes, $100 million of that CapEx savings all resides at GenOn. The $250 million in the non-recourse financing we expect to be at the NRG level, offsetting what would otherwise be NRG capital allocation or CapEx towards the completion of that environmental spend at Midwest Gen. And then the asset sales, depending on the outcome, will be a blend in terms of proceeds between NRG and GenOn. So the way you summarized that is accurate, yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. And then the first \u2013 your primary focus is debt reduction. And when we get into 2017, you're looking at, presumably, if we could keep the EBITDA from bleeding too much, an incremental $350 million improvement in cash available for capital allocation at the parent?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Yes. That's correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Which is \u2013 and as I said, that does not include, at least in that calculation, any anticipated proceeds from the GreenCo process or further NRG Yield drop downs, which would obviously supplement that $350 million.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got you. And then my follow-up question, when I look at the buildup on page 16, the GenOn EBITDA of $335 million, that's net of the shared services payments. So if I was looking at a simple EBITDA just on asset performance, you're projecting it to be about $530 million in 2016?","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","That's right. You'd add back that roughly $200 million to get to that sort of asset-level performance as you said, correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks guys.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys, good morning. First quick easy question for you. I wanted to focus on the $100 million cost savings, just what that comprises of, and also more importantly, I see a FORNRG statement here of a cumulative 180. Just wanted to understand \u2013 or 150 through 2018. Can you comment how the two jive? What should we expect in 2017 and 2018 in terms of run-rate increments?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mauricio?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP","Hey, good morning, Julien. So, I mean, the first one is the operating expenses. And I would \u2013 I mean, I listed some of the main drivers of that, but I will say the first gives you the impact of the decisions, the asset optimization decisions that we made at Portland, the suspension of Portland and the retirement of Huntley.","The second one is, we've gone through a line-by-line review of every single asset, particularly those that are in more challenging market conditions, and we have right-sized the cost structure to comport with those market dynamics. And then the third one is, as we have a portfolio of close to 50,000 megawatts, allow us to optimize the management of forced outage risk, and what I call the contingency money that we know we're going to have to spend, we just don't know where.","So if you have a single asset you have to budget for the forced outage, the probability of forced outage. But when you have 50,000 megawatts, then you can optimize across the entire portfolio. So that is the step one. Step two is the FORNRG portfolio, and this is a target. You're familiar with the FORNRG, because we show the fourth iteration of this. We are looking at, company-wide, how can we do the things are we're doing today, better in a more cost effective way.","So think of this as contract renegotiations, rail renegotiations, property tax renegotiations. So, I mean it is the host of things that we can do, that is very difficult to pinpoint today, but we've been very effective and we've been very successful in achieving, in the past, these cost savings, which they will flow directly to the bottom line.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And that's all, in every part of the company.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP","That is, everywhere in the company, including retail, just across the company.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. So perhaps just a quick follow up there. Some of your assets seem to generate negative cash flow in Texas. I'd be curious how that might fit into that puzzle? And then perhaps to boot with that, a more strategic question, coming back to perhaps the, what you alluded to earlier Dave, about yourselves being in those top four residential players, how is the strategic review proceeding?","And perhaps, if you can answer one question, what is it that you need to \"fix\" your retail solar \u2013 your solar efforts more broadly? Is it an installation platform, or what are you kind of ending up in the strategic process thus far?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Do I...","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP","I mean, I'll \u2013 Julien, I'll go first about your...","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll probably go on the second part of the question. I forgot what the first was.","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP","I will take the first one, David. So, I think you are alluding to \u2013 I don't know what particular asset you are saying, but what I can tell you, Julien is I think we've demonstrated financial discipline when we have an asset that, number one, is in negative free cash flow; number two, the prospects of a recovery in that market are such that we cannot justify the continuing operation of that plant; and then number three, which I think is significantly important in Texas, is the prospect in terms of additional environmental CapEx to comply with upcoming rules.","We will evaluate, and if needed retire, just like we did in Huntley. What I can tell you is that we're not in such conditions right now in Texas. I have said in the past that our coal portfolio is a low cost, environmentally controlled portfolio, and I would expect that coal plants that actually have a much dire forecast in terms of environmental CapEx, we'll have to make that decision before \u2013 so I'll just leave it at that, but make no mistake, I mean, we will continue with the financial discipline that we have shown over the years.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Good. And Julien, I shall break your part of the question that I'm going to answer into, itself into two parts. So it was, sort of how is the strategic process going with GreenCo, I think particularly as it applies with a focus on Home Solar. And then you say, what you need to do to fix the sort of issues within Home Solar? So \u2013 and Kelsey is on the phone, and Kelsey if you have anything to add after I finish, go ahead, particularly obviously on the second part of that question.","So, on the strategic process, what I would tell you, Julien, is we've been through the sort of preliminary discussion stage, out there talking to multiple people who are interested, and I think specifically road-testing the idea that what we're looking to do is sell a majority stake to someone who is sort of strategically aligned with our thinking about the prospects for the business, but maintaining a substantial minority stake so that we can maintain the business connection with the rest of the company, and also have a second bite at the apple in terms of value realization.","And it's early days yet, what I would tell you, I mean it's relatively easy for people to express interest before they have to write down a number on a piece of paper, but I would say in the early going, there is quite a lot of interest in it, and no problems with the structure we're proposing. So that's what I would tell you about where we are now on the strategic process.","With respect to the issues in the Home Solar, what I would tell you is there are operational issues, basic blocking and tackling, that sort of come with running a business that has complex logistics and is growing at an annualized triple-digit rate. And so you get the sales engine revved up and then the installation and the deployment have to follow, and getting that exact balance right, as I think other players in the industry have demonstrated, is a constant work in progress.","But I would say there's an enormous amount of attention on it, particularly the productivity of our installation crews right now I think is double what it was just a couple of months ago. And then there's the paper work from going from installation to deployment, which is \u2013 which is obviously, in terms of getting the right software and just making the process much more efficient. Kelcy, is there anything that you would want to add to that?","Kelcy Pegler - President-NRG Home Solar","No, I think that's pretty good, David. I would just say we're working on the cohesiveness. We're satisfied with both our sales and installation increase in Q3. Most notably what was important to us was we were able to sell and install more systems without adding significant head count. In fact, we ended Q3, almost exactly flat from a head count perspective. So without adding cost.","And Julien, I think what we've done is, we've really focused and we're determined to achieve that 90 day from signature to energization of the solar system. And we've identified with this theme of an excess backlog, which is any job that exceeds that 90-day timeline. And then the optimal backlog, which is all the jobs being executed within that timeline, and we believe we're poised to be executing all of our backlog and all of our bookings to energization in the first half of 2016 within 90 days. And so that's what I would tell you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Kirkland B. Andrews - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Good morning.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just picking up on the question about the GreenCo process. I was curious, David, you made the statement in your prepared remarks \u2013 I think it was the prepared remarks \u2013 that you wouldn't be surprised to see utilities wanting to buy into this business. Are you suggesting that among the parties you're talking to, there may be some utilities? Can you just give us any color, or is that sort of more further out in time?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, no \u2013 well, I didn't say it in my prepared remarks, just for accuracy's sake. I would not say that that's the main body of \u2013 I mean, if you \u2013 I guess Jonathan, what I would say in simpler terms, if you divided the people that are interested \u2013 or if you categorized the people interested in GreenCo into financial partners and strategic partners, there are significantly more financial partners than there are potential strategic partners.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I mean, that's helpful. And then I guess, I mean like, when you announced the Reset, you were talking much more broadly about potential structures, majority, minority, and the like, and it now seems to be \u2013 you have enough visibility that you are pretty confident that you can do a majority deal. Is that what we should take away from the shift in the language?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think what you should take away is that, through the preliminary phase, we got a significant amount of encouragement on that, but I think what you should really take away is the point that was made in the prepared remarks, that first and foremost it's value that we're looking for so. So, again, it's \u2013 I'm just commenting, I mean, people have not put numbers down on a piece of paper. So there's a significant amount of flexibility that remains around the GreenCo process, and we won't \u2013 I don't want to give any sort of final answer until we see numbers on paper, and then we might modify accordingly, but definitely in the non-quantified stage, there is a lot of encouragement around that structure.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And you, can you just give us any sense of when, what do you think the likely timing for this to play out? I heard you say you prioritized value over speed.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, I don't remember if we said it in our prepared remarks on September 17, but I think we did, which was that, we thought the whole process would be concluded within six months to nine months, and I continue to be highly confident in that timeframe. I mean, I know that some questions have happened, would be able to give people sort of more of an update by the end of the year. And I just can't make a call on that, because usually right when you're in the middle \u2013 I mean, we will clearly know more by the end of the year, but whether we share with you \u2013 usually you don't talk about things when you're in the middle of an active discussion.","So I can't really help you, other than say, Jonathan, we're confident that it'll all be done within the original six month to nine month timeframe.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much, David.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Liz, I'm sorry, and I'm sorry for the people who want to continue to get in the queue, but we \u2013 since we have an NRG Yield call in a relatively few minutes, we're going to take one more question, and then for the others in the queue, again, I'm sorry, and please call in and we'll answer any questions that you have.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Could you just kind of give us the timeframe for the cost cuts? So it's the $100 million, is that for the full 2016 or is it a partial year? And then the remaining $150 million, when does is that fully kick in?","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Neel, it's a good question. I'm glad you asked it, because I mean, I would say within the prioritization of time, within the, all the various initiatives that make up the Reset, our immediate focus, and something that's taken an enormous amount of time of management team and across the organization, has been cost-cutting.","And that's precisely so that we could give you the answer I'm about to give you, which is we're \u2013 we're working so hard so quickly, because we want full year 2016 effect, both with respect to the G&A cost program, which internally goes under the name DOP, for doing our part, and then on the O&M cost saving portion. And Mauricio, do you have anything to add to that or...","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP","No.","David Whipple Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think so. Yes. Anyway, Neel, did you have any follow-up question, and then we'll call it a day, Liz.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yeah, just had one quick question. So, with gas prices where they are, how are Parish and Limestone in Texas running now? Are you seeing some displacement from gas assets, or what do those capacity factors look like?","Mauricio Gutierrez - Chief Operating Officer, Director & Executive VP","Yeah, Neel. So, I mean I think the statistics that we're providing on the third quarter were pretty representative of the \u2013 how competitive those two assets are. I mean, we increased our generation in Texas for our baseload fleet, that includes nuclear and coal. As we go into the shorter months, we always see a reduction in capacity factors, but that's just normal seasonality.

And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Cole, Head of Investor Relations, please go ahead.","Kevin L.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. Joining me this morning is Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. And also, on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","I'd like to start with the key messages for the second quarter on slide 3. Our business performed exceptionally well during the quarter with earnings up 23% from the same period last year. We are making excellent progress on our Transformation Plan initiatives and we are on track to hit all targets. Finally, our portfolio is demonstrating once again the value of integration between retail and generation during the volatile summer months, particularly in Texas. I am very pleased with our results so far, and I am confident we are well positioned for the rest of the summer and beyond.","So, now moving on to the highlights of the quarter on slide 4. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, we delivered $843 million of EBITDA during the second quarter, driven primarily by higher realized prices in Texas, higher retail loads, and the impact of accretive cost-savings. Kirk will provide additional color on our results and the impact on our credit metrics.","For the first half of the year, our business has performed exceptionally well, but with the warmest and historically most volatile months still ahead of us, we are maintaining our 2018 EBITDA guidance range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. And as has been our practice, we will update our 2018 guidance and initiate 2019 guidance on the third quarter call.","During the quarter, we also completed our first $500 million share buyback in which we repurchased almost 16 million shares at an average price of $31.80 per share. Our commitment to returning shareholder capital continues, and we are on track to execute on our second $500 million share buyback","following the close of either NRG Yield and Renewables or our South Central portfolio.","I also want to highlight the progress we have made on GenOn, which continues to move forward towards final resolution. In July, we executed a settlement in which we received associated releases from GenOn. And on August 15, we will terminate shared services. GenOn is planning to exit bankruptcy on October 1 of this year.","We are also making significant progress on our Transformation Plan, which you can see by our scorecard on slide 5. During the quarter, we removed an additional $145 million of costs, bringing our savings through the end of June to $225 million and placing us well on the path to achieving our 2018 target. We also continue to make progress on our margin enhancement program. You will begin to see the results of this program on our scorecard during the second half of 2018 with the results really ramping up in 2019 and 2020. Both of our cost savings and our margin enhancement efforts remain on track for their current year and full plan targets.","As you know, asset sales remain a key focus for the organization. We closed on the sale of Boston Energy Trading and Marketing or BETM and our Spanish Town asset, while reaching an agreement to sell our interest in two additional assets, Keystone and Conemaugh. We actually had anticipated selling these assets in 2019 but we were able to accelerate this timeline and execute on the opportunity to monetize these assets ahead of schedule.","Our NRG Yield sales process is moving along very well. We have received all necessary regulatory approvals and are finalizing the consents. We are making every attempt to bring this to conclusion as swiftly as possible and are working hard to make this a third-quarter close.","The sale of our South Central portfolio is also making good progress, and we continue to expect that this transaction will close in the second half of this year.","Although we are in the middle of the summer in Texas, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the positioning of our integrated model on slide 6. And as you all know, ERCOT supply\/demand balance is the tightest it has been in many, many years. Following the retirement of nearly 5 gigawatts in the past 12 months and steady load growth. This market tightening led to an increased probability of scarcity conditions this summer, which was reflected in higher forward prices. So far, demand has not disappointed, setting a new record peak of over 73 gigawatts in July. However, this record load was met with equally impressive reliability across the grid, which temper real-time pricing as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. In other words, it took nearly perfect system-wide reliability to meet the summer peak demand.","Now, our generation fleet perform exceedingly well during this period, driven by the extensive planning and preparation we put going into the summer. I would like to commend our operational teams for achieving excellent results and having no recordable injuries during this recent heat wave. We also took measures to ensure the stability of our retail business. This included leveraging our integrated approach with generation to help manage supply cost and proactively helping our customers manage their bills.","These tight market conditions in Texas also created longer term opportunities to ensure (00:08:26) the predictability of our earnings. We took advantage of higher prices and executed power hedges at attractive levels for the summers of 2019 and 2020. This is exactly the period that saw the majority of price increases. We also took the opportunity to hedge our shoulder months and off-peak periods with natural gas as a proxy for power in those same years.","I mean, this summer so far has showcased the strength of our integrated model with complementary businesses that increase the predictability of our earnings. As I said before, we're only halfway through the summer and historically, the more volatile months are still ahead of us. So, we all at NRG remain focused across the organization on ensuring a successful summer.","Now, moving to our market outlook and starting with ERCOT on slide 7. Much like this summer, the longer term outlook for ERCOT fundamentals remain very strong. As you can see on the left-hand chart, on a weather-normalized basis, total loads remain very robust and growing and continues to grow at 2% per year. This is a dynamic we don't expect to change anytime soon. We also continue to see project delays of new generation anywhere between three to five years. And given that forward prices remain below new build economics, we also don't anticipate this dynamic to change in the near term.","So, bottom line, and for the foreseeable future, we expect tight reserve margins in ERCOT with higher probability of scarcity pricing and greater volatility as the system works to stay in balance. These conditions create an opportunity for both sides of our business and highlight the longer-term value of our integrated approach, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide.","Our retail business is in a stronger position relative to other players in the market due to the integration with generation and a scalable customer acquisition and retention engine. Increasing loads means an increased opportunity for new customers while potential volatility creates opportunities to take market share from other competitors. And our generation business benefits from higher prices with greater opportunities to hedge the portfolio at attractive levels. Also, higher hedged prices allows us to invest in our fleet to achieve higher reliability, increase the predictability of our earnings, and mitigate the impact of volatility on our retail business.","Now, onto the East on slide 8. PJM held its capacity auction for the planning year 2021-2022 this past May. The results reflected less new builds and significant amounts of unclear capacity, signaling more disciplined development and bidding behavior. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, on a same-store basis, NRG cleared more megawatts at higher prices than the previous auction.","As we continue to optimize the fleet, we will focus on maintaining our assets in premium locations. We now have 85% of our PJM fleet in the premium ComEd zone, which, once again, separated to clear at a price of $196 per megawatt day. Throughout the East, we are encouraged by the multiple regulatory avenues for market reform that could benefit both our generation and retail businesses. For example, FERC recently committed to protecting PJM's capacity market against the impact of state-driven subsidized generation. It's clear to us that FERC wants to see the true cost of all resources reflected into the market by putting a price floor on subsidized generation. This is a strong and clear pro-competitive position coming out of FERC.","As part of this process, FERC also requested additional comments on the possibility of carving out low and subsidized generation from the market. This is referred to as the Fixed Resource Requirement or FRR. We believe these requests for comments and the idea of taking single units out of the market is counter to the spirit of FERC's ruling. We remain confident that FERC will act consistent with the pro-market principles communicated in its recent orders and either fix the FRR, to ensure that it does not negatively impact price formation, or perhaps rejected in its entirety. That said, details matter and we're looking forward to actively engaging on this issue both with PJM and FERC.","So, with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for our financial summary.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning first to the financial summary you'll find on slide 10. For the second quarter, NRG delivered $843 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is a 23% increase over the prior year. Our strong second quarter results were driven primarily by higher power prices and retail load in Texas and further enhanced by the impact of cost reductions across the organization as we continue our progress on the Transformation Plan.","And for the first half of the year, NRG has delivered nearly $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and our cost improvement program is only now beginning to hit its stride. Although we're very pleased with these year-to-date results and the summer prices in ERCOT continued to show strength, we are nonetheless maintaining our 2018 guidance ranges of $2.8 billion to $3 billion in EBITDA and $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion in free cash flow.","I will note however that our first half results, combined with our outlook for the balance of the year, currently plays to our expectations for 2018, well above the midpoint of our guidance range. And we will update and narrow these ranges on our third quarter call. At that time, we'll also provide guidance for 2019, which will include the impact of more robust targets for cost savings and margin enhancements, with nearly $200 million in additional EBITDA expected from these initiatives in 2019 versus our 2018 targets.","As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we've also completed phase one of our $1 billion share buyback program with 15.7 million shares repurchased at a price \u2013 average price of $31.80. We remain highly focused on closing our two large asset sale transactions, and we'll launch in the second half of that $1 billion share repurchase program following the first of these two transactions to close, which is likely to be the sale of NRG Yield and Renewables later this quarter.","During the second quarter, we also completed the issuance of $575 million in new convertible notes with a coupon of 2.75%. By repurchasing an equivalent amount of NRG senior unsecured notes, NRG's aggregate debt balance will be unchanged, and we expect approximately $20 million in annual interest savings, further augmenting free cash flow as we retire shorter-dated and higher-coupon maturities.","To this end, we've already repurchased $89 million of senior unsecured notes of varying maturities to-date and have recently provided notice to repurchase $486 million of the 2022 notes, our nearest maturities, which will mark the completion of the senior note refinancing associated with the convertible issuance. As a reminder, we've also targeted $640 million of debt reduction, which we expect to complete later this year in order to achieve our 3 times net-debt-to-EBITDA target ratio.","And finally, this quarter, we successfully closed on the settlement with GenOn, which accelerated a significant portion of the items set forth in the original Restructuring Support Agreement, including the $261 million settlement payment by NRG and the repayment by GenOn of the intercompany revolver, which were previously expected to take place at emergence. With the financial commitments associated with the GenOn bankruptcy now largely behind us and GenOn well advanced in its (00:17:40) efforts, GenOn is targeting an emergence from bankruptcy early in the fourth quarter.","Next, I'd like to take a few moments to update our pro forma financial summary, which you'll find on slide 11. As a reminder, this summary is based on the midpoint of our consolidated 2018 guidance and provides a view of 2018 EBITDA and free cash flow from retained businesses, net of any contribution for businesses and assets we are selling as a part of the Transformation Plan.","On the left side of the slide under the heading, prior pro forma, we start with the pro forma 2018 summary we provided on our last earnings call. Next, two second-quarter events gave rise to the need to adjust our pro forma view. First, the restructuring of the Ivanpah non-recourse project debt; and the amendment of some of the project's governing documents during the second quarter resulted in a change in the accounting treatment for Ivanpah. As a result, as of the second quarter, Ivanpah is no longer consolidated in NRG's financial statements but will appear as an equity investment.","On a fully consolidated basis, Ivanpah's contribution to the midpoint of our EBITDA range was approximately $100 million. The impact of deconsolidation is the elimination of our partner's 45% share of Ivanpah EBITDA, leaving approximately $55 million of EBITDA from Ivanpah, reflecting only NRG's 55% stake in our revised pro forma. Importantly, aside from the impact of the income statement and adjusted EBITDA, Ivanpah's total non-recourse debt of approximately $1.1 billion will no longer appear on NRG's consolidated balance sheet.","Turning to the second adjustment to our pro forma view, with the closing of the XOOM acquisition, we are adding the annualized expected EBITDA of $45 million from XOOM to the retail portion of our pro forma EBITDA. Of note, this is an annualized number for XOOM on a pro forma basis while the actual contribution for XOOM to our 2018 results will be a partial year, reflecting EBITDA only for the second half of the year.","The EBITDA adjustment for deconsolidation of Ivanpah is offset by the addition of the annualized EBITDA for XOOM and, as a result, our total pro forma adjusted EBITDA remains $1.6 billion. The impact of Ivanpah's deconsolidation is limited to EBITDA and, as a result, the $45 million increase from EBITDA from XOOM is reflected in our revised pro forma consolidated free cash flow before growth, which is now approximately $1.05 billion.","And finally, as I've noted previously, our pro forma EBITDA and free cash flow are based on the midpoint of 2018 guidance, which includes the impact of the 2018 Transformation Plan targets. Beyond 2018, we expect an additional $275 million of annual adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow by 2020 as the Transformation Plan reaches its final targets.","Turning to slide 12 for a very brief update on 2018 capital allocation. Our 2018 capital available as well as our committed capital items are largely unchanged from the previous update. The only exception on the allocation front is having now settled most of the financial aspects of the GenOn bankruptcy, our capital outlay for GenOn has been reduced by $18 million to $160 million.","As shown in the dotted box below the chart, the only capital allocation item associated with the GenOn settlement, which remains to be paid, is our annual pension contribution of approximately $14 million, which will take place in the second half of this year.","As a result of both the reduction in committed capital towards GenOn, as well as the receipt of $12 million in proceeds from smaller asset sales previously not expected to occur until 2019, our remaining 2018 unallocated capital, shown on the far right, has increased by approximately $30 million, resulting in approximately $700 million in 2018 capital remaining to be allocated.","Finally, on slide13, we've again provided the 2018 pro forma net debt to EBITDA calculation as well as the walk to our 2020 ratio, all based on our 2018 pro forma EBITDA. This calculation is based on revised pro forma EBITDA, which I reviewed earlier, and is largely unchanged from our previous disclosure. The adjustment for Ivanpah is now smaller due to the impact of deconsolidation.","As a reminder, in 2018, we are temporarily reserving just over $1 billion in cash in order to achieve our 3 times net debt to EBITDA, and we expect this cash will be made available for capital allocation beyond 2018 as the additional EBITDA from the Transformation Plan initiatives, again beyond 2018, allows us to free up this cash by 2020 while still maintaining that important 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.","Having previously focused exclusively on 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio established with the Transformation Plan in these updates, this quarter, we're also providing two additional key credit metrics: adjusted cash from operations to net debt, as well as the cash interest coverage ratio to provide you a more complete picture of the strength of our balance sheet and credit profile.","Although we remain a BB-rated company, this rating does not fully reflect the strength of these credit metrics. With consistent execution continuing to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our integrated platform, supported by our improved and simplified balance sheet, I believe we have the opportunity to earn and improve credit rating.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio for his closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Kirk. Turning to slide 16, I want to provide you with a few closing thoughts on our 2018 priorities and expectations. We continue to deliver solid financial and operational results while remaining on track with all of our cost and margin targets under our Transformation Plan.","Our integrated platform is working as designed through the volatile summer months and remains well-positioned for tight market conditions in the future. As I said, winning the summer and closing on our announced asset sales is our most immediate focus. I look forward to updating you on our progress and providing you more clarity on our capital location as we move into the second half of the year.","So, with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. James, we're now ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Our first question will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. How are you?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So, I wanted to follow up here on the asset sale progress. Just wanted to get a little bit of clarity. First, with respect to the next round of buybacks and capital allocation, would you expect to potentially provide that prior to the next third quarter call, seeing a timeline potentially on an expedited basis to close some of these larger transactions?","And then, separately, with respect to the asset sales, how do you think about the execution of the balance, the smaller set that have yet to be announced? Obviously, you announced the Keystone\/Conemaugh stuff today. But what's the commitment level? Have you kind of reviewed the balance of the portfolio? And are you opting to hold on to some of the smaller stuff?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, Julien. So let me start with the first one. I mean, we're going to launch the next round of \u2013 the next $500 million of share buyback once we close on either Yield, Renewables or our South Central portfolio. So, if that happens before our third quarter call, you will know and all the investors will know.","With respect to your second question about the balance of the remaining asset sales, we're going to be providing you another update as we go through this evaluation towards the end of the year. But just keep in mind, I mean, right now, our focus is to close on these two transactions. And as we move into the year, the team is now shifting gears and evaluating the other asset that will be done for closing. Now, as you can tell, if we see an opportunity like we did with some of the asset sales that we accelerated from 2019 to 2018, we're going to do it. But I just want to make sure, I mean, all the resources that we have right now are completely focused in closing Yield and Renewables and South Central.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Understood. And then secondly, on retail, can you talk a little bit more about what you did in the quarter? You obviously alluded to it in the prepared remarks, but where does attrition stand today through kind of this period in August, and how do you think about the resiliency kind of going forward? Are you actually adding customers at this point? I mean, I'm just sort of curious.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. So, let me start by saying that retail had a phenomenal quarter in the second quarter. We had warmer-than-normal temperatures. That basically pushed our loads and load usage. Keep in mind that we also added XOOM for one month. And Business Solutions also performed well. So, it was a good quarter all around for retail. But Elizabeth, I mean, with respect to some of the attrition questions.","Elizabeth R. Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Julien. We actually saw, as you can tell by our results, customer counts up over 10%, largely driven by XOOM. We have what I would call pretty steady attrition and retention performance. There's a little bit of pressure but nothing that, I would say, is out of the ordinary or unexpected. We're really pleased with the performance of both the acquisition and the retention engine through second quarter and are looking forward to a strong third and fourth quarter as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bottom line, on track with the targets that you delineated previously on the retail side.","Elizabeth R. Killinger - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, sir.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you, all.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Greg. Thank you.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So, there's a bit of a debate in the market, Mauricio, that I'd like to hear your perspective on. On the one hand, the lack of really, really high levels of volatility this summer despite the strong load has been disconcerting to some investors who thought that those high levels of volatility would validate the thesis on the Texas market and your long-term view on power market there.","But on the other hand, the lack of massive volatility has allowed you to continue to print stable profit margins and, actually, do some really solid hedging that may or may not have been actually maybe upside relative to what you promulgated in your outlook.","So, from a business perspective, what would you rather see, the conditions you have now or massive levels of volatility that put more stress on the business and potentially bring a faster new entry cycle?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Well, first is the \u2013 I think you need to look at the fundamentals in Texas. And what I was very pleased to see this summer is that demand is real. I mean, setting a new record peak of 73.3 gigawatts in July, which is not normally even the month that you'll see the most extreme weather, was very encouraging.","So, when you think about the fundamental picture of ERCOT, the supply\/demand and the timings (00:29:57) that exist, it hasn't changed. And actually, this summer has validated that it's here for the foreseeable future. I think what you saw this summer is just a combination of a few things. One was a very strong demand, but that strong demand was met with, like I said, perfect performance by a degree. I mean, when I say perfect performance, you have to just look at the forced outages that we had in that peak there (00:30:22), and I mean, they were quite remarkable.","And also wind performed, as expected, very close to normal. So, obviously, when you have this type of a situation, yeah, I mean, real-time prices were below what people were expecting. They are not necessarily low, but they were below what people were expecting. And from my perspective, we want a market that has very strong fundamentals and that has a really good market structure on both generation and retail like the one we have in Texas, so that is the perfect combination. We don't want to see a market that is clearing too low that necessarily doesn't reflect the fundamentals of the market and that's why we have been so, I guess, frustrated over the past couple of years in ERCOT.","But also, we don't want to see a situation where you have a scarcity pricing that leads to perhaps shading low, and none of those two extremes are good for our franchise. Our integrated franchise of generation and retail is somewhere in the middle. So, the most important thing is that prices reflect the fundamentals of the market. And from where I see it, the fundamentals in Texas are incredibly strong. And they're going to be very strong for the foreseeable future. I mean, even if you look at the forward prices, I mean, they've been rising, but they are not at the point that are incentivized new-build economics.","So, supply continues to be delay on new generation. Demand, we just saw that it was very strong. So, I mean, I want to see a market that is well-functioning, not that is bouncing on either side of the extremes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you. And are you in a position now to tell us where inside the guidance range you're trending year-to-date? Or is the rest of the summer just too much of a wild card, and you rather wait till Q3 to tighten the outlook?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Greg, it's Kirk. I actually gave you a little bit of that in my remarks. I anticipated that question. And what I'd said, just to repeat, is the performance year-to-date, combined with our current outlook for the balance of the year places us well above the midpoint of our current guidance range. So, (00:32:44).","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Sorry if I missed that. Apologies.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","That's okay. It's okay.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","And then, I also saw there were a couple small retail transactions in the quarter that I just \u2013 can you give us some more details on customer counts or multiples to EBITDA on those, or were they just too small to call out?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, Greg. I mean, this is just the normal course of business. We actually buy books. I mean, we have an engine in Elizabeth and she's very effective in terms of identifying these opportunities. So, I wouldn't even think that they are representative of a transaction like XOOM. This is just a normal course of business. We're always looking for books that we can add to our retail business, and that's what they were.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, guys. Take care.","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thanks, Greg.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning and congratulations on solid progress across the board.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Abe. Good morning.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Based on the forward curves and your hedging today, could there be more cash available, I mean, over the next couple years above the $4.3 billion? And then, have your thoughts on capital allocation changed at all, and do you remain confident that share buybacks are the best way to get the stock high or closer to fair value?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Well, let me just start by saying that we're not going to front-run (00:34:20) our third quarter earnings call, which we're going to be providing guidance for 2019.","My thoughts on share buybacks continue to be the same. And for that matter, all capital deployment, we're going to adhere strictly to our capital allocation principles. And as I see today, given where the price of our stock is, I don't think that there is any other more compelling and attractive investment than our own stock. So, until that changes, I think it's fair to assume that that's where we're going to be focusing on.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then, shifting gears a little bit to Texas, can you discuss how you balance your hedging strategy with your fundamental view of the reserve margin and prices, particularly in 2020?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Sure. Chris Moser?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Abe. This is Chris. Yeah. So, as we're looking at 2019 and 2020, obviously, we've got a view on where things should be compared to the clears that we're seeing. But make no mistake, as we did in 2019 and 2020 when prices get to be a good level and a good level above where it was 6, 8, 12 months ago, there's a certain amount of sense that comes from kind of sweeping some of that profit off the table and that's kind of the balance and the approach that we take.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. And just to make sure, I mean, most of the hedging happen in the summer of 2019 and the summer of 2020, right, Chris?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. The hedges that were put on in Q2, the power hedges were mainly summer on peak hedges. True.","Abe C. Azar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. Got it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning. So, on the on the N Yield (sic) [NRG Yield] (00:36:13) sale, you mentioned you're just finishing up getting consents. Could you be a little more specific on what consents you still need?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Steve. Yes, I mean in the Yield and Renewables, like I said, I mean all regulatory approvals are done, consents, we're well on our way to have all of them. At this point, we're not providing any specific details in which ones are remaining but what I can tell you is that I have confidence that we're going to be in a position to close on the third quarter. That's what I will share on that, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","But we're making just great progress on the consents.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","That's great. And then just \u2013 this is just, to make it clear, the market. So, should we expect that this buyback will be announced \u2013 assuming that closes in Q3 and that's the first one, the buyback $500 million will be announced at that time?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah, not only will be announced, will be launched as soon as we close on that transaction.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Okay. And then, just in terms of the additional hedges how meaningful were they to your kind of 2019-2020 portfolio? How much more hedged are you?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah, Steve. If you look back in the Appendix, I don't \u2013 what is the page \u2013 page 21, you'll see the move there. We layered on a big chunk of natural gas equivalent hedges. Think of that as covering kind of the shoulder months and off-peak timeframe and the assets up in Chicago. And then you'll see that we did power hedging of 10% or 11% on an annual basis. But the hedge we're putting on were really more focused specifically in this summer.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes. So, Steve, I mean, from a percentage standpoint, while it appears on that disclosure on an annualized basis, think of it as they were all put in the summer. So, the summer percentage was much higher than what is showing in the...","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean it was the mini part of the curve, right? It was the thick part of the curve that we were trying to sell and use the liquidity that was out there. I'm very happy with the hedge we put on for 2019 and 2020.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just in that light, I mean, your three-year guidance goes all the way back to last fall. Obviously, Texas prices are meaningfully higher since then; natural might be a little lower. In the totality, though, are these hedges being put on at premiums to what your plan has been?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, Steve, just to be perfectly clear, I mean, what we provided was a pro forma based on \u2013 back then, 2017, with the impact of the Transformation Plan. And yes, I mean, if you look at the curve, all else equal, I mean, it's been a positive move. Kirk?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, it's Kirk. First, overall the answer is yes. And the reason I say that is you can look no further to the fact that when we first established guidance for 2018, for example, that would be in the third quarter of the previous year, third quarter of 2017, generally speaking, our guidance is centered around the midpoint of our expectations, and those expectations are informed by what the summer prices are, in this case, in 2018 at that time.","And, I think, since our pro forma view is all anchored on that 2018, the degree to which 2019 and 2020 summer prices today, for example, are higher than where 2018 summer was at the time we established our guidance, and I can tell you the answer to that question is yes and you can quantify it by looking back, that would give rise to the fact that all things being equal, that would give rise to an increase in that pro forma view since 2018 would be higher than it would 've been expected at that time. And as I said \u2013 I confirm that our expectations are well above the midpoint of our range currently for 2018.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","That's great. And one last, just quick thing on the Texas market, you mentioned a very strong plant performance and also, wind, I think being decent. Just how about demand response and how much is that impacting this in your thinking?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Sure. Chris?","Chris Moser - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. When I go back and if we look on the slide that Mauricio was talking about, I mean, load was about 500 megawatts \u2013 or just talking about the peak hour on the 19th there, load was around 500 megawatts higher or worse compared to the CERA expectation. You had generation around 1,000 megawatts better, which was just really flawless execution across the grid. And I'm happy to say we've put in some extra spring outages to be ready and that really paid off for us. We had fantastic performance from the operations group.","So, anyway, so those two net out to be, give or take, 500 megawatts better than the CERA. And the CERA had around 1,000 megawatts of space in it. So, we really didn't get into the position where we needed a ton of other things to come to bear to save the market. I will say that the market \u2013 it was an interesting setup because Thursday wasn't supposed to be the high day. So, this is the 19th. It was supposed to be that following Monday, the 23rd, which was actually forecast at over 76,000 megawatts for the better part of that week. And so, I think a lot of the DR and whatnot was being prepared to be brought to bear on that Monday, and they may have missed the party a little bit because it turned out to be that Thursday was the high day.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So, Kirk, just to clarify, on the EBITDA guidance well above the midpoint, is that for the retained assets or is there a split between what is retained and what is being sold in terms of what's kind of driving that uptick?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, I'm not going to get specific about breaking beyond what our official guidance is, which is consolidated guidance. But if you take a step back, the big portion of the adjustment, if you will, to get to a pro forma view is a portfolio that consists of two things primarily. One being LaGen, which is kind of an integrated type of business, not to say it doesn't have upside and downside. And the bulk of what remains is Yield, which is largely contracted, relatively low volatility, right? And you can look at it because Yield provides point estimates on their own guidance, which is largely unchanged. So, I think you can infer from that, to a large degree, that outlook is anchored off of our expectations for the balance of the portfolio. But I wouldn't go so far as to give you specifics other than I think it's reasonable to infer on the basis of what I just described.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And that's super helpful color. All right. And secondly just following up on the ERCOT and PJM question. So, firstly on ERCOT, Mauricio, do you vary that if there is no spike in ERCOT and dry signal (00:43:31) in 2018 that you reach that point whereby 2019 or 2020, you have these unsustainable reserve margins which are so low that it's actually not suitable for your business? Is there a concern of that and how do you think that gets mitigated?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yes, I mean, my concern is always that the prices do not reflect the fundamental view of the market. I mean, that to me is what keeps me up at night because if the prices don't reflect that, then developers, generators, we can't \u2013 perhaps we're making decisions with not the best information.","Now, obviously real-time prices are just one aspect of it. I mean, you have to look at the day ahead. You have to look at the forwards, and most of the decisions are made on forward pricing. The day-ahead market is also an indication on how people get set up. And then real-time prices is what happens. I mean, so far we have been talking about real-time prices which basically was the result of perfect performance of the grid and a very strong demand.","But as I think about 2019 and 2020, obviously I want to make sure that the prices are reflecting the fundamental situation in Texas. And to the extent that that lost, rational developments, rational market participants are going to react in the right way. So, that to me is the most important thing, strong fundamentals and a very strong market structure. That's what we're striving to do.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thank you. And then, finally, on PJM, as you said, I think it's clear that FERC wants to do the right thing here and create the competitive market or the right competitive marketing signals. But there's a pretty big gap between that and what the proposals are right now. Do you think there is enough time between now and January to get this done or do you think this gets pushed out to next year maybe?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","I mean, it's really hard to handicap the timing when it comes to FERC and when they're going to act. And so, I'm not going to venture into that. What I will tell you is just we have been very encouraged now for now a couple of orders on the position that FERC has taken in terms of protecting the integrity of competitive markets. If you go back to Mystic, the PJM and (00:46:10) capacity, I mean there has been a lot of consistency coming out of FERC. So, that's the data point that we have. Everything else we don't have the details, then it's a speculation. So, I don't think we will be venturing into something that we don't have enough information to even quantify. So, that's what I will say.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Really appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So, okay, I'm going to go back to the share buybacks question. So, Kirk, you're saying that now you expect excess cash of almost $700 million. It seems like you do have a line of sight for the NRG Yield transaction closing and yet you are not launching the next batch of buybacks. What am I missing here?","Kirkland B. Andrews - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, everything you just described is correct. The one thing to keep in mind is outside of the asset sale proceeds, which we've given some indication about timing, our organic free cash flow generation is relatively backend loaded, right? We need to get through the summer in order to start to build that cash.","So, as we come into the fall, our cash balances begin to appreciate. In the interim during the summer months, while still waiting on that cash, that also tends to be the more significant draw in liquidity, which we have ample supply of, but we have to be prepared that if we do see scarcity pricing events or the anticipation thereof in the forward market, that then entails a need for posting additional collateral. So, we have to balance the liquidity, the reality that the organic cash flow is backend-loaded, supplemented by the receipt of the asset sale proceeds which is obviously determined on closing. So, all of those factor into that timing in terms of the expectation in terms of launching Phase 2.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. But just one more follow-up here, I mean you seem to be indicating that you will be waiting for the transaction to actually close, NRG Yield I'm talking. I thought in the past we were just talking about a line of sight of that transaction and I know that it might be probably just a small difference as far as time is concerned, but I mean are you basically depending on that cash really entering your bank accounts so desperately before the buyback can kick off?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Angie, this is Mauricio. I mean, well, first, we launched the first 500 megawatts because we felt comfortable that the transactions had been announced and we were making good progress. And I was very pleased with how we performed on this first 500 megawatts. The second 500 megawatts is going to be launched when we \u2013 at close. We feel comfortable with that. And, as Kirk is saying, I mean, we have to balance when those (00:49:23) are coming in and the back-end loaded of our cash flows come in in Q3 and Q4. Particularly with the type of volatility that we're seeing in the market, it is important that we take extra precaution.","And then once we do that, then on the third quarter call, what I said is any remaining capital that is available for allocation, we'll be providing that clarity. So, I think that's the sequence that you should be expecting, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And my last quick question. So, you showed us the performance on your retail and generation portfolio in the second quarter. Can you say what happened in July in Texas, if that strength, especially in retail earnings, continued?","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, what I will tell you is that we actually, with the benefit of the pricing that we receive in the forward markets, we got ready, both on our generation and our retail business, to perform the way we have described we performed in July. I mean, aside from that information, I don't want to front run the earnings, the third quarter earnings where we're going to be talking specifically about the summer months. But I felt it was important that many of you are investors and wanted to know just what happened in this first month.","And I think what I can tell you is that we're very pleased with the performance of the fleet. I'm very pleased with how our integrated platform performed as a whole, generation and retail in the first summer months. And that's \u2013 I mean, I think that's what I'm comfortable right now sharing with. I mean, like I said, we're just in the middle of the summer. I mean, the most volatile months are still ahead of us. Historically, August and September, that's where you see a lot of high \u2013 consecutive high temperature day.","So, I want to make sure that the entire organization remains focused, and there's still a lot that can happen in the next two months. And I will be providing you an update on the third quarter call on what happened this summer. But so far, I feel very good.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey guys, congrats on a good quarter and good first half of the year. I want to come back to the hedging slide a little bit, slide 22, but I'm just kind of comparing it to the same slide in the prior-quarter deck. And I'm just looking at the total forward hedged revenue number, and I'm only looking at 2019 and 2020. So, 2019, it's $1.2 billion and 2020, it's $828 million. If I look at that same slide for the first quarter, cumulatively, if I just take the differences between what you had hedged then and what you have hedged now, it's $1 billion, $600 million in one year, $400 million in 2020. Does that all just drop to the bottom line meaning that $600 million \u2013 I mean, that's $1 billion of incremental cash flow that will likely flow into NRG relative to what you may have thought or had hedged or had locked in three or four months ago.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, Michael, thank you and \u2013 I mean, keep in mind that this is just the top line. This is revenue. This is not gross margin. So, you have \u2013 first, you have another leg. I mean, you have to take into consideration what happened on the fuel side, right? I mean \u2013 and we haven't provided that here. And then secondly, I mean, I think as we have said, I mean, this reflects the hedging that we did, the incremental hedging that we did on both natural gas equivalents and power.","So, I don't think you should have \u2013 this is an indication, this is a direction, but it's not a one-to-one drops to the bottom line. I mean, there are other things that are not captured completely in that line.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Right. But if I just think about the fuel side, I mean, we haven't seen PRB coal move a lot or lignite move a lot and I think you had probably already procured your uranium. So, it's really just \u2013 and gas prices haven't exactly spiked a ton in the last couple of months. So, unless it's just something dealing with the retail offset and maybe having retail contracts that don't just pass through the fuel clause, I would assume that at least a large portion of this incremental billion dollars would flow to you, if not all of it.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I mean, with respect to retail, keep in mind that in 2019 and 2020, I mean, any price changes affect every single retailer. So, I think the dynamic that we have seen when prices increase and benefits wholesale generation and perhaps it put some pressure on retail, that doesn't happen in 2019 and 2020 because all retailers are exposed to the same price of electricity. So, I think that addresses your concern around retail.","And then with respect to \u2013 that's why we provide the sensitivities. I mean, I think the sensitivities give you a sense on how our portfolio behaves depending on the different market conditions. And I would actually \u2013 I think that's perhaps a more comprehensive way to look at the \u2013 how our portfolio will or how the changes in the prices will impact our portfolio. So, I would direct you more to the sensitivities as opposed to this one line that is very specific on revenue.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated, guys.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. With that, I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Gutierrez for closing remarks.","Mauricio Gutierrez - NRG Energy, Inc.","Well, thank you.

Crane","Thank you, Chad, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I know many of you have taken time out of your schedule from the EEI conference in Orlando, so I thank you, in particular, for joining us. And I think you should consider yourself lucky that you're in Orlando because it's snowing up here in Princeton, New Jersey. I'm sure many of you would like to dial back later in the morning for the first-ever NRG Yield earnings call, so we're going to try and be very brief in our remarks on both calls today.","Joining me here for the NRG call are Jim Steffes and Elizabeth Killinger, who run our Northeast Retail and Texas Retail businesses, respectively; and Chris Moser, who runs our commercial operations. All 3 of them will be available to answer any specific questions you might have in their areas. Plus, of course, I'm joined by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mauricio Gutierrez, our Chief Operating Officer. They will both be presenting after me and then also available to answer your questions.","Beginning with Slide 3 in the presentation deck, even with wholesale power prices in our core markets persistently weak throughout the summer period, I'm generally satisfied with the company's performance, financial and otherwise. As you know, the third quarter is, by far, our most important quarter. And this year, we generated $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA. In the weak wholesale power market environment that we remain mired in, $1 billion is a good result. Indeed, it is the most EBITDA NRG has ever generated in the third quarter.","Given the average summer weather and the almost total absence of scarcity pricing in our core markets, this record performance, obviously, a product of the key strategic initiatives we have executed over the past few years. Ultimately, while we had to reduce our 2013 financial guidance last quarter, this quarter's performance affords us the ability to stay within our revised 2013 financial guidance.","One clear impact of this summer's weather and subdued market pricing that followed it has been a continuous decline in the forward-price curve across all of our core wholesale markets, but especially in Texas. As such, we feel it's prudent at this time to reduce our 2014 guidance. Which reduction, as Kirk will address in more detail, is entirely driven by the earnings expectations of our core wholesale business. The other parts of our competitive NRG platform, our retail business and our clean energy business, continued to deliver strong support for the long-term investment thesis for NRG.","Indeed, our free cash flow before growth for 2013 is extremely robust with $896 million produced after 3 quarters, well on our way to a full year result in the upper end of our previous guidance range. And free cash flow before growth in 2014 is projected to be somewhat lower than previously expected as a function of reduced EBITDA guidance. But it, nonetheless, is expected to remain strong within over $1 billion midpoint in our revised 2014 guidance for free cash flow before growth.","As regard to our strategic initiatives, NRG is, as you know, a company that does not sit still. We move towards where the opportunity is in our sector. And of course, in so doing, we feel that we have established a record over the past several years of investing the company's excess cash generation wisely, both for capital allocation and through reinvestment in our asset platform. And we believe the most recent examples of this reinvestment in our asset platform, the GenOn deal, and now, Edison Mission Energy, are further proof that we are deploying a good portion of that capital in acquisitions that will be accretive over time through a combination of operational and cost synergies even under near-term market conditions, while preserving for NRG the significant upside that will accrue to us in the event of a significant upturn in the cyclical commodity markets.","So taking these 2 acquisitions in chronological sequence, turning to Slide 4, I know this is a slide you have seen before, so I will be brief. But it's important to note that a lot of hard work is still going on within NRG to ensure the successful conclusion of the integration program arising out of the GenOn transaction. With nearly 90% of the identified cash flow synergies now executed upon, we are positioned to realize the full benefit of the combined company beginning as planned on January 1, 2014. Since the 1-year anniversary is approaching, I want to again thank our integration team led by Anne Cleary and Patti Helfer for their extraordinary effort in this positive result. Under their leadership, we have not only improved our ongoing cost structure as a function of our overall size, we have improved the basic functioning of our company.","Now moving to Slide 5, the EME transaction and what comes next. I know we announced the proposed acquisition of Edison Mission Energy just over 3 weeks ago and have not provided much detail to date. Even though Kirk will be providing some additional commentary on this call, I fear that the paucity of information we are providing, particularly financial information, will be frustrating to you. Unfortunately, the information blackout needs to continue, at least until the go-shop period expires on December 6.","Strategically, I'd like to reiterate that the proposed acquisition of Edison Mission drives value on multiple fronts for NRG, both directly and through our majority ownership interest in NRG Yield. With nearly 1,600 megawatts of both conventional and wind assets eligible for future drop-downs in NRG Yield, the EME acquisition will increase the megawatts available to NRG Yield owned by NRG by over 150% compared to the ROFO Assets.","Secondly, by expanding our base of conventional assets at a value we believe is appropriate, NRG achieves more geographic and dispatch diversity, which is likely to prove quite important across the wholesale price cycle, particularly as the supply-demand dynamics in our various core regions separate from each other. Importantly, though, in light of the tremendous success we have experienced in realizing synergies from the GenOn combination, our confidence in both rightsizing the acquired platform, as well as creating incremental value from leveraging the lessons learned from GenOn, is quite high.","With that said, let me update you on a few elements of the transaction on Slide 6. First, while we remain in a go-shop period through December 6, 2 key milestones already have been achieved and the necessary regulatory filings remain well on track. The bankruptcy court approved our bid protections, which provide us some consideration for our effort should a higher bidder come on. In addition, 74% of the bondholders of EME have now signed on to the planned support agreement entered into between EME and us. These are both important milestones in the progress of this deal.","On the right side of Page 6, you will see areas of potential value-creation we see in the EME transaction. We look forward to sharing more of our thoughts around these areas when the timing is more appropriate and as we become more intimately familiar with the operations of the EME assets.","Now turning to Slide 7. As we move into the final month of 2013, our priorities are clear. First, we need to finish strong and improve all of our operational and financial metrics led, of course, by safety. Beyond achieving strong day-in, day-out performance, there are several strategic initiatives, the implementation of which looms large. The most notable of these strategic implementation projects are listed on this Slide 7. And most, if not all of them, should be familiar to you. You will be hearing more about each of these in the months and quarters to come.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. We are first summer behind us as a combined company. And with over 47 gigawatts of generation under management, I was quite pleased with our third quarter performance. Our wholesale and retail units performed well. We have made significant improvement in safety, and the continued execution on our operational improvement initiatives across the organization allowed us to achieve record quarterly financial performance.","While the overall summer was challenging in terms of wholesale prices in Texas and the Northeast, we are encouraged by the clear signs of market design improvements across our key markets. Specifically, we were pleased to see the Public Utility Commission of Texas making clear their commitment to a mandated reserve margin, eliminating some uncertainty in our largest market.","As David mentioned, as a result of the weak summer prices in Texas and the increasing gas production in the Northeast, forward gas and power prices have continued to be under significant pressure and importantly, have not recovered to the levels we saw earlier this year. As such, we are now recalibrating our expectations for wholesale business for 2014.","Our development program continues to achieve significant milestones. During the quarter, we achieved commercial operations at El Segundo Energy Center and Agua Caliente, and with CVSR coming online in October, brings our total solar portfolio to over 700 megawatts in operation. Finally, Ivanpah remains on track to achieve operations by the end of the fourth quarter.","Turning to our operations review on Slide 10, and starting with safety. Our performance improved during the quarter as a direct result of the initiatives we implemented prior to the summer. We had 110 out of 119 facilities finish the quarter without a single recordable injury, and we remain well on track to deliver another year of good safety performance.","Our total generation was down 9% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower gas generation on our East Region, which was down close to 20% from last year. A combination of low power prices in PJM, the retirement of bunker 3 and 4 and unplanned outages in our PJM coal fleet drove generation down for these. Our other operating regions were relatively stable, with South Central and California experiencing slightly lower generation driven by higher gas prices and Texas roughly flat to last year.","Regarding flat performance, despite lower starts, our gas fleet performed at 98% starting reliability. But as I mentioned earlier, coal availability metrics were impacted during the quarter by unplanned outages at Morgantown and Cheswick. These happened during periods of low power prices. And with exceptional work by our commercial operations team, the economic impact was muted. It is important to note that when it mattered the most, the portfolio performed exceptionally well during the 2 heat waves in the Northeast this summer.","Regarding our continuous improvement effort under the FORNRG program or the operational synergies from the GenOn combination, our plant operations group continues to do an outstanding job in balancing operational performance, with maintenance spend consistent with market conditions. From both our historical practices and the lessons learned from the GenOn combination, the foundation has been set to execute on the synergy numbers we have committed to you and sets the stage for our next effort, the Edison Mission transaction.","Moving on to Slide 11. Our retail business performed within our revised expectations for the third quarter, where we delivered $176 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to $173 million last year. Our Texas mass business remains strong and stable, with unit margins up slightly during the third quarter, along with continued customer growth and bolstered by the introduction of innovative products and services.","In the Northeast, we launched sales of NRG-branded electricity plants to residential customers, including customizable products and time-of-use offers. When margin pressure and competition in the Northeast mass business remains intense, we're being disciplined in acquiring customers and managing profits.","Moving to the Commercial and Industrial business. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we continue to be very diligent in our efforts across all competitive markets where we're winning profitable deals and walking away from those that don't meet our return threshold. To avoid just competing on price, we are intensifying our efforts to provide comprehensive solutions to our customers beyond system power, including backup generation, solar and demand response. Consistent with this strategy, we closed the acquisition of Energy Curtailment Specialists as demand response provider this quarter.","Across our entire retail segment, we will continue to manage the business in order to optimize customer growth and near-term earnings while protecting long-term value. For the 11th consecutive quarter, we increased customer count, and at the same time, our cost-reduction efforts continued to produce strong results, with third quarter operating expenses down 8% year-over-year and SG&A per customer down 9% year-to-date.","Turning to Slide 12. While our overall quarterly performance was quite strong, the fact that this summer was a disappointment should be no surprise. Beginning with Texas, a combination of higher wind generation at peak hours, lower unplanned outages and the lack of sustained heat resulted in low power prices with no scarcity hours. From our perspective, it was not the result of weak demand but a healthier supply stock. While we expected to see a recovery in the forward markets throughout the summer given the tight fundamentals, the weak summer prices have put significant pressure on the forward markets, as you can see on the lower-right chart, further exacerbating the challenges to justify new investments.","On the regulatory front, we were very encouraged by the clear direction from the PUCT to move forward with the mandated reserve margin and the implementation of an operating reserve demand curve or RDC. We will continue working with all stakeholders to ensure an adequate level of reliability and the most efficient method to achieve it. We remain bullish on Texas and the prospects for our integrated generation and retail businesses, which we just expanded with the acquisition of the Gregory cogeneration plant at a value significantly below replacement costs.","Moving on to PJM. Prices this summer cleared higher than last year, driven primarily by higher gas prices and 2 short heat wave events that led to some scarcity pricing. As you can see on the right side of the slide, gas prices have moved up from the lows seen in 2011. In the Northeast, the most recent trend is the abundance of gas coming from the Marcellus Shale, which is changing the market dynamics on flows of gas in PJM and New York. The compression in gas basis have been more than offset by the increasing gas prices at Henry Hub, thus keeping coal-to-gas switching at a relatively low level this summer.","We continue to see a significant opportunity for our portfolio in the medium term as a result of anticipated coal retirements, improvements in the energy market reflecting greater scarcity pricing and potential changes in the capacity market around imports and demand response.","Finally, moving to New York. On our last call, we recognized the New York guidance for the market design changes made that improved price formation during reserve shortage at the end of this summer. Unfortunately, we're disappointed by the recent actions by the MISO to reduce capacity prices.","Last week, the MISO has started to phase the implementation of the Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone, immediately after successfully convincing FERC that such a zone was necessary and proper. Further, next week, the PSC is going to consider whether to formally rescind the retirement of that commercial facility. Taken together, this action seriously undermine confidence in the New York market. Our regulatory team is working very closely with all stakeholders to ensure we maintain the integrity of competitive markets.","As you can see on Slide 13, we have significantly increased our hedges in 2014 and are now less than 10% open for the nuclear and coal fleet. We are slightly more open on heat rates due to a few factors: Implementation of ORDC [ph] in ERCOT; increases in price cuts from $5,000 to $7,000 per megawatt hour; and the fact that forwards remain depressed to the lack of liquidity in the market and the weak repricing this past summer. We constantly evaluate the benefits of crossing megawatts with our retail company versus being opportunistic for hedging in the wholesale market. This inherent functionality has the potential to mitigate the impact of financial players leaving this space due to financial reforms.","We remain fairly open in the outer years as we see an opportunity for market recovery in 2015 and beyond. Incremental demand due to coal retirements, LNG exports and industrial activity should help support gas prices. In our coal power markets, tightening reserve margins, market design changes, tighter rule for demand response and exit of noneconomic capacity will provide upside for our existing portfolio. As we have done in the past, we will continue to position our portfolio consistent with our fundamental view.","With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to Slide 15. Although higher power prices failed to materialize over the summer months, NRG generated $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter, placing us at just under $2 billion for the first 9 months of the year and on track with our guidance range for 2013. Third quarter EBITDA was comprised of $741 million from wholesale, $176 million from our retail businesses and $83 million from NRG Yield.","Turning to highlights. On the strength of $844 million in adjusted cash flow from operations and nearly $1.2 billion year-to-date, NRG's liquidity improved to a robust $3.7 billion as of the third quarter. In October, we reached full commercial operations at CVSR on time and on budget, putting us in a position to offer our remaining interest in the project, along with 3 other ROFO Assets through 2014, which I'll describe in greater detail shortly.","Finally, during the quarter, we worked to complete negotiations with the relevant stakeholders in the Edison Mission bankruptcy, culminating an agreement to acquire substantially all of EME's assets for $2.635 billion or $1.572 billion net of acquired cash.","Turning to the guidance overview on Slide 16. With the summer now behind us, we are narrowing our 2013 guidance ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow by $100 million. Specifically, we expect 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. Though a lack of any meaningful hot weather over the summer has caused us to reduce the upper end of our guidance ranges for both wholesale and retail by $50 million, we remain on track to end the year within the revised ranges we've provided on our last earnings call.","Guidance for 2013 adjusted EBITDA for NRG Yield remains unchanged at $240 million. We've also narrowed the range of our 2013 free cash flow guidance by $100 million, largely reflecting the impact of the narrowed expectations for adjusted EBITDA. However, while the range have narrowed, we have increased the lower end of the free cash flow guidance by $75 million, reducing the upper end by only $25 million. This is largely due to a reduction in expected working capital and reduced capital expenditures over the balance of the year.","Turning to 2014 guidance. As a result of declines in forward power prices in both ERCOT and PJM and the corresponding impact in the expected financial performance for our competitive generation business, we are reducing wholesale adjusted EBITDA guidance by $150 million or about 7.5% reduction versus our prior wholesale guidance. Importantly, however, 2014 adjusted EBITDA guidance for both retail and NRG Yield remains unchanged. These guidance ranges continue to reflect our expectations for NRG standalone, without giving effect to the potential impact of the pending EME transaction.","Finally, as a result of the reduction in EBITDA guidance, we have also reduced our guidance range for 2014 free cash flow before growth by $150 million. However, despite lower forward wholesale prices and the reduction in guidance, we still expect NRG to deliver approximately $1 billion in free cash flow before growth in 2014.","Turning to Slide 17. As of September 30, as I mentioned, driven by strong operating cash flow, NRG's liquidity now stands at just under $3.7 billion, an increase of over $600 million since our second quarter update and $300 million year-to-date. During the third quarter, NRG generated over $800 million in adjusted cash flow from operations, leading to nearly $1.2 billion year-to-date, which, as shown in the sources and uses table to the right of the slide, was the primary driver, further strengthening corporate liquidity.","I'll now turn to Slide 18 for an update on the Edison Mission transaction, which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2014. While the expected timing of closing is not yet known, as previously disclosed, we expect the EME asset to deliver approximately $330 million in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2014, with $185 million of this EBITDA delivered by 1,600 megawatts of long-term contracted wind and gas generation, which is highly consistent with the NRG Yield asset profile, in quality, counter-party credit and average contract duration.","Walnut Creek, a brand-new 500-megawatt combined cycle gas-fired facility, which reached COD in May 2013 under a 10-year contract with Southern California Edison, is highly comparable to NRG Yield's Marsh Landing facility, as well as NRG's El Segundo Energy Center, which is one of the right-of-first offer assets.","Approximately 1,100 megawatts of EME's long-term contracted wind portfolio makes up the balance of NRG Yield eligible megawatts and complements NRG and NRG Yield's growing contracted renewal portfolio, enhancing geographic and counter-party diversity. We expect this substantial high-quality contract generation portfolio to generate project cash distributions of approximately $60 million to $70 million, and implied ratio of CAFD or cash available for distribution to EBITDA roughly equal to that of the current NRG Yield portfolio.","When combined with the 6 right-of-first offer assets, this would create a pipeline of drop-down candidates representing more than 1.5x the cash available for distribution to be generated by NRG Yield's current portfolio in 2014. Through NRG Yield, we expect to more effectively highlight the value of the contracted portion of EME's asset base, replenish and expand NRG capital for allocation, while further driving dividend growth and total return at NRG Yield. The balance of the Edison Mission portfolio further enhances NRG's geographic and fuel diversity and includes an additional 4,300 megawatts of coal and 1,100 megawatts of gas, providing NRG new opportunities to apply asset optimization best practices.","Turning to funding for the transaction. The table to the right of the slide illustrates sources and uses based on the purchase price and implied adjustments using EME's balance sheet cash as of September 30, plus our estimate of anticipated changes in non-recourse project debt over the remainder of 2013. For the asset purchase agreement, the actual purchase price will be adjusted based on the differences between actual project debt and cash at the time of closing versus the amount scheduled in the asset versus agreement.","Beginning with uses and using the September 30, 2013, cash balance as an example, along with our estimate of year-end project debt, the implied purchase price adjustment would be $306 million. At closing, we expect approximately $800 million of EME cash to be immediately available to fund a portion of the purchase price. We further expect the remaining cash will become available in the months following the closing of transaction. Excluding a non-recourse debt, which will be assumed as a part of the transaction, total implied uses, net of $800 million in estimated EME cash available at closing, will be just over $2.15 billion.","Turning briefly to sources. The purchase price for the transaction will be paid in cash, plus 12.7 million shares of NRG common stock. We expect to fund the cash portion of the purchase price using a combination of $800 million in NRG excess cash, $700 million in corporate debt, which is sized to permit us to maintain our target balance sheet management ratios, with the balance funded through a temporary draw of NRG's revolving credit facility, which we'll repay using the expected release of EME working capital during 2014.","Moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on the impact of the EME transaction on NRG's 2013 capital allocation. On the far left of the chart, we began with $1.105 billion in 2013 excess cash at the midpoint, as shown in our capital allocation slide from the second quarter. Changes in excess cash since our last update include an increase of $200 million, which consist of $25 million based on the increase in the midpoint of our 2013 free cash flow guidance, with the balance due to the suspension of the remaining $175 million in share repurchases for 2013.","This increase in cash is basically offset by uses of excess cash since the second quarter update of $198 million, which largely consist of acquisition and integration activity, plus changes in growth investments, leaving excess cash unchanged since our second quarter update, prior to taking into account the EME transaction. As I reviewed on the preceding slide, we are reserving $800 million of excess NRG cash to fund the transaction.","On a pro forma basis, however, after giving effect to the expected release of additional EME cash of approximately $250 million, NRG will use approximately half of our 2013 excess cash to fund the EME transaction. Importantly, this is before giving effect to any proceeds resulting from the drop-down of ROFO Assets offered to NRG Yield, which we'd expect through 2014 and I'll review in greater detail on the next slide.","And in addition, beyond the ROFO Assets, drop-down of EME's substantial portfolio of NRG Yield eligible assets would further serve to expand NRG's capital following the EME transaction. And we'd expect to provide further clarity on this once the transaction is closed.","Finally, turning to Slide 20, I'd like to provide an update on our intentions for NRG's assets under the right-to-first offer or ROFO agreement with NRG Yield. NRG intends to offer 4 of the 6 ROFO Assets through 2014. Specifically, we intend to offer NRG Yield the opportunity to acquire El Segundo, High Desert, Kansas South and NRG's remaining interest in CVSR, which on a combined basis, represent over 700 megawatts and approximately $55 million in cash available for distribution. This represents more than a 50% increase in cash billed for distribution over the current NRG Yield portfolio.","Beyond 2014, NRG currently expects to offer the remaining ROFO Assets, including NRG's 51% interest in Agua Caliente and our 50.1% interest in Ivanpah. These assets are expected to provide an additional $45 million in cash build for distribution, and when combined with the CAD [ph] from the ROFO assets to be offered through 2014, would double the cash available for distribution at NRG Yield. These potential transactions will not only provide NRG Yield the opportunity to meaningfully increase cash available, driving dividend growth and total return, but will allow NRG to optimize value and meaningfully increase cash available for allocation via the cash portion of drop-down proceeds.","With that, I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Kirk. As I had typically done in the past and because this is the last earnings call of the year, I'd like to take a few moments to assess the progress we have made this year -- I mean the goals we set at the beginning of the year, and this is on Slide 22.","It would be easy for me to say our stock prices performed pretty well this year so we've had good performance, but we like to think a good stock price performance, in mathematical terms, is the product of our top-to-sell operating performance, times the aggressive and effective implementation of well-thought-through strategic initiatives. On both fronts, I feel like we've had a great year.","Across our conventional portfolio, while wholesale prices in Texas did not come through like we had hoped, we've brought online, on time and on budget over 1,400 megawatts of new gas-fired generation across the fleet nationally. Additionally, we increased the amount of free cash flow synergies from the GenOn combination by over 60% from the original $300 million a year identified when we first announced the transaction to over $408 million now.","In our retail business, even though we've experienced some challenges in both the Northeast and in the C&I parts of the retail business, our leading retail franchise in Texas remains quite strong, and we continue to bundle new products and services such as demand response with our energy solutions to further strengthen the retail business, which remains a very significant and steady contributor to NRG's corporate-wide strong cash flow.","And across our clean energy franchise, we now have over 1,650 megawatts gross of solar and wind assets, which are soon to be augmented by another 1,700 megawatts of renewable generation from the Edison Mission fleet. We also vowed, at the beginning of 2013, to make the most important goal we set for ourselves in this area, was to highlight the full value of our leading solar platform. And with the success of NRG Yield, we feel that we have done just that.","Before I close, I would be remiss in not mentioning our existing $200 million stock buyback program, which the EME transaction has prevented us from completing. With respect to capital allocation, we have always prided ourselves on being prudently balanced and on being value-maximizing. This has required us to be flexible so that we can deploy capital when we see value-enhancing opportunities in front of us such as the Edison Mission transaction. As such, while completing our 2013 share buyback program is off the table for the time being, we look forward to fulfilling our commitment once the EME transaction is completed and our unrestricted funds have been replenished.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator, to Janeyda, to -- so we can answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on the increased financial information that you plan on providing after the go-shop period, I'm wondering how soon after the go-shop ends in December we might get that information.","David W. Crane","Well, I mean, we haven't picked a time specifically, I mean, I'd be interested in your feedback. But I mean, with the holidays coming up fairly shortly after there, I think we were thinking early January. I mean, one thing is for certain, we now ask people to wait until our next call, which would be in late February. So -- but I mean, if there's a big difference in Newark, if you think between early January and the call we would otherwise schedule on December 25, we'd be happy to hear about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo with UBS.","Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Paul from [indiscernible]. My question is about -- if you could just provide some -- I know it's a sensitive topic, some high-level color on some of the synergies with the Edison transaction, particularly your plans for the new coal plants Wahkiakum County [ph]?","David W. Crane","Paul, I mean, I don't really think we can. I mean, I think that for the most part, about all I can tell you is that if you look at the playbook that we followed for the GenOn transaction, it's pretty precisely the playbook we plan on following for the -- for Mission. And so I would sort of expect the same sort of thing. I mean, there's a certain amount that we're going to be able to talk about in terms of what we think we can achieve by putting the company together. But in the same way when we did the GenOn transaction, there were things that we were not comfortable sort of estimating in quantitative terms until we had actually owned the assets and got to a certain level of detail that comes with ownership as opposed to the level of detail that comes with due diligence, then we felt more comfortable to talk more specifically. I think that coal assets in Illinois, those are -- they definitely sort of fall in the second category. That's the more complicated part of the story. So the way we look at them and evaluate them in Illinois could be very much the way we evaluated the GenOn acquisition and the new assets we had in Pennsylvania, in particular, but also in Maryland.","Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Now that you're undertaking this transaction, what are your thoughts on further M&A at this point?","David W. Crane","Well, I mean, there's no doubt that, I mean, we like to pride ourselves as a company that we can do several things at one time. But I mean, this is a big transaction, and the big transactions tend to be sequential, number one. Number two, the more transactions you do, the less -- potential transactions, there are less to be done. So I wouldn't say that we've shut down our ability to sort of look at what's available in the industry. But I would say, Paul, what we want to do is we want to be sort of actively engaged in the market because as you could tell by the general context of our earnings call, the commodity price environment at the wholesale side of the business remains extremely challenged. And the time that you want to be a buyer of assets in this space is when there's no hope. When the future looks as dire as possible, that's when you want to be a buyer because that sense of sort of giving up is what causes the price to be at a level where we can continue to do what we've tried to do, which is to accumulate assets in the sector in a way where we -- basically, we can reduce the cost structure because this is a scale business. And so we want to be as active as we can because we think it's a good time to be a buyer, precisely because the commodity price environment is so weak. But we have to recognize that with GenOn just done and Edison Mission still in our forward sights, there are limits to what else we could do until the Edison Mission deal is done.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I want to think about this EME and think about the retail impact. Is there anything there that would either offer revenue synergies, cost synergies, any expansion opportunity on the retail side?","David W. Crane","I'm going to ask Jim Steffes to talk a little bit about it. I would -- Travis, what I would say is at best, that would be not even a secondary, maybe even a tertiary or whatever comes after secondary. I mean, I think there's been some -- we've watched with interest a little bit what goes on, on the retail side in Illinois with community aggregation and all that. Not that we've been that interested in playing that space at the sort of -- at the margins that we've seen there. But clearly, having generation in Illinois would probably get us to take a slightly harder look at the market. But I would absolutely not say that anything having to do with retail wasn't a driver of the Edison Mission transaction. But, Jim, do you have anything?","James Steffes","No, I mean, I think I agree completely with that, David, which is it does position us to look again at Illinois on the retail side and see where that market will evolve to and how much more NRG and our multi-branch strategy can take, can move into that market. But it's something we'll be looking at over time as the transaction moves forward.","David W. Crane","Yes. Travis, do you have anything else on your mind because we sure threw a wet blanket on that question?","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","No, that's exactly what I was thinking of your thinking about expanding. Obviously, we've seen Dynegy talk about that expansion in Illinois and potential margins there. But secondary on it, another subject then, similar I guess. But you talked about, and you have for several quarters, about the financial players, the liquidity issues. How has that changed? Let's look back 3 years or so or 4 years ago, how has that liquidity changed? So maybe liquidity 2, 4 years ago was better as we look out to 3 years forward and now maybe it's 2 years. Again, I'm just putting words in your mouth. But how has that liquidity shrink -- shrunk, if you get what I'm saying?","David W. Crane","So -- and Chris Moser is going to answer that question. But Travis, I just want to make sure I understand. So you're asking about liquidity in terms of how it's affecting our ability to serve hedges we want to in our core markets? Or are you sort of saying the liquidity discount that often makes this sort of out years of trading to us look unnatural from what we actually expect to see in those years? Is it -- because that -- when you said 2 years out, we used to debate that all the time internally. I mean, are other markets a realistic proxy of what's going to happen for 2 years or 3 years or whatever, is that what you're wanting to ask about as well?","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, so that latter, whether you thought you -- yes, 3 or 4 years ago when you had some more financial players, perhaps even some more industry players, whether you were better able to capture what you thought were fair prices 3 years out, let's say. And relative to now, maybe you can only capture fair prices 2 years out?","David W. Crane","Good question. Chris?","Christopher S. Moser","Travis, this is Chris. So as I rewind the clock and go back into kind of 2008, 2009, there were certainly more banks with bigger appetites out there willing to serve. But at the same time, with the general chaos in the markets back in '08 and '09, there were some pretty huge spreads in terms of CDS and whatnot, which actually made it pretty costly for us to go too far out in terms of the charges, credit charges, that the banks were charging back then. It's kind of the reverse now, things have calmed down on the CDS side. But there are just less and less banks that are interested in that with big prop books. One of the things I will emphasize, though, is I think we're in a much better position now than we were back then, simply because we have the retail side and we can cross internally as deep in the curve as we want, and not have to worry about what the banks are doing, or what the CDSs are doing. So I think that's a real nice choice that we have. We can go to the market if we choose to. We can choose to leave it open or we can cross with retail, because they're always -- retail is price agnostic from the perspective is they're pricing deals all the time. It doesn't matter if we think prices are high or low, they are pricing deals all the time. Whereas from the wholesale side, the perspective is always we'd rather sell it when prices are high. So that outlet, the retail outlet is a very good one, a very good option for us to use in cases when we see less liquidity.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you get that 3 years out? I know retail contracts tend to be a little shorter than that. But you [indiscernible] figure out period where you see that liquidity and that missed pricing right now?","David W. Crane","Yes, I would say that the retail contracts, in terms of the residential and whatnot, it tend to definitely be at the shorter-term nature, but the C&I certainly extends beyond 3 years. And that's not a small part of the portfolio that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Cohen with ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just couple of questions. First of all, I noticed that you kept the guidance range $200 million wide despite adding a lot of hedges in the third quarter. Can you just run through like what the drivers that will determine where you'll fall in the guidance range, what those are now?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Yes, John, it's Kirk. I mean, I would say that the 2 primary drivers of that would be the upside on the retail side and most notably, the formation of scarcity prices, especially obviously in ERCOT and certainly, on a weather upside as well, which have an influence on that. So because we are more or less open or we'd lean long on the heat rate or on the gas side of our portfolio, that's probably the most significant component of what would lead us towards the upper end of that range.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one other question. If in PJM, the gas dynamics don't improve or if they even get worse, are there levers that you can pull either on the cost side or additional shutdowns that will mitigate some of the revenue impact to the wholesale part of the business?","David W. Crane","John, is this question motivated by this idea that gas and PJM's going to trade at a discount to Henry Hub because of Marcellus excess supply, just to be more specific, is that what you're asking?","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I mean, if you see a persistent low gas price, does that continue to pressure power prices? Are there other things that you would do in how you operate your fleet?","David W. Crane","Mauricio?","Mauricio Gutierrez","I guess, I'd try to elaborate a little bit on the earnings slide. Certainly, gas basis have been under a lot of pressure because of the gas [indiscernible] we're seeing out of the Marcellus Shale. We need to make sure that the absolute total price that is paid is the one that is going to drive the power dynamics in the East. And I tried to show that actually, chemical prices have moved from their lows that we saw in 2011. So the absolute price of gas in the Northeast have actually increased from 2 years ago, making the coal-to-gas switching less. I tried to depict 2014 and 2015 gas basis, and we see it even potentially a further compression on that. But you need to also take into consideration the Henry Hub price or the absolute price. Now the other dynamic here that will affect what we do with our plants, keep in mind, there is a very robust capacity market. And that capacity market, there are some market design changes that I think, in our perspective, will be supportive of our capacity prices, whether it is limiting imports into the capacity option or changing or tightening the rules around demand response. I mean, I think all of those changes will be supportive and will make a determination in light of not just energy markets but also capacity markets, Jon.","Operator","And this concludes the Q&A portion for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. David Crane for any closing remarks.","David W.

Crane","And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this, our first quarter 2013 earnings call. Today, I'm joined here this morning by Mauricio Gutierrez, the company's Chief Operating Officer; and Kirk Andrews, the company's Chief Financial Officer, both of whom will be giving a portion of this presentation. As well, I'm joined by Chris Moser, who runs the company's trading and commercial operations activities; Elizabeth Killinger, who's responsible for the company's retail business in the ERCOT market; and Jim Steffes, who's responsible for the company's activities in the Northeast retail markets, and they will be available to answer any specific questions that you have in their area. So let's get right into it.","I have dispensed with our customer and quarterly financial highlight section, which has been my tradition, because our first quarter, which, in recent years, has been one of our softest quarters, fulfilled those expectations again this year. The weather in our core regions did not provide us with much opportunity, and our own performance in the face of the near-term opportunities that were presented to us was pretty uneven. Having said that, we are entirely focused at NRG on succeeding across the short, medium and long term, and we are always working on all 3 levels simultaneously.","This quarter, for reasons which should be obvious, our focus, in particular, has been on ensuring our success over the medium term, which I am defining for this purpose as the remainder of 2013 and full year 2014. In that regard, notwithstanding the lackluster first quarter that we are reporting today, I'm very pleased that, as a result of our successful actions over the past 3 months, we are in a position to reconfirm full year 2013 adjusted EBITDA guidance, increase full year 2013 free cash flow before growth guidance and reconfirm full year 2014 guidance for both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth.","This positive medium-term outlook is driven, in significant part, by actions largely within our control, particularly our successful integration of GenOn and realization of the costs and other synergies arising out of that combination, and the successful completion of our current construction program across both our conventional and renewable generation fleet. I'm going to talk about both of these in somewhat greater detail.","But first, on Slide 3, let me put our discussion in the context of our 3-part approach to executing against our multi-tier strategy. Obviously, at both the base of the pyramid, which is conventional generation, and at its top, clean energy, successful completion of our current construction program plays a big role in our medium-term prospects. But that is not all we are doing at either level that will have substantial influence on our financial performance. Proactive asset management in NRG's conventional fleet has led to some improved prospects, most notably at the Dunkirk plant, which received an extended RMR agreement and a New York ISO, good through May 2015.","A new environmental compliance plan across our existing coal fleet is shaving an additional $100 million in aggregate off of our projected environmental CapEx spend. This reduction, when coupled with our previous announcement, now brings our total reductions in projected environmental spend to approximately $200 million below what we were estimating just 1 year ago. Likewise, we have several initiatives underway around our Tier 1 utility solar portfolio, which now is entering into the final stages of construction, with Alpine and Borrego already have achieving -- already have achieved commercial operation in 2013 year-to-date.","With respect to our contracted solar assets, as we have stated previously, on or about the time of commercial operation of these assets is the appropriate time for us to take steps to realize or otherwise highlight the value of these assets. As such, you should expect to hear from us before the end of the second quarter -- before the end of this quarter with respect to our plans in this regard.","Sandwiched in between the capital-intensive generation and clean energy parts of our strategy, our competitive retail business continues to perform well. For the ninth quarter in a row, our retail business has achieved organic customer count growth through our multi-brand strategy and emphasis on differentiated products and services. In addition, we have extended our exclusive loyalty program partnerships with national brands, like Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, across our regions.","Furthermore, last year, we launched an exclusive partnership in Texas with Nest Labs, pursuant to which NRG, in its own name and through both our Reliant and Green Mountain retail brands, will be the exclusive partner among retail energy providers for their groundbreaking Nest Learning Thermostat. A few weeks ago, we announced that we have expanded that partnership to include our NRG retail business in the Northeast. This is an important step for us and for the industry, as it is, in our opinion, a harbinger of where the competitive retail business is going, namely beyond the meter, into the house, in order to provide more value-added energy services, and where we expect to generate more brand loyalty and reduce customer churn.","Finally, critical to our retail success is scale and effectiveness in customer operations. While our customer count is up by 139,000 year-over-year, total costs to support our customers decreased slightly, as we work to continuously improve our systems and processes.","Turning to Slide 4, to greater detail on our construction program. There's been a lot of focus, both inside the company and externally, on our industry-leading solar construction program, and certainly, that attention has been well deserved. I'm pleased both with the construction progress that we have made across the entire solar portfolio and the prospects for a successful conclusion to the current phase of our solar construction program, which is generally on time and on budget.","But overlooked somewhat externally, but not internally, was the current status and construction progress being made by our 4 conventional construction programs: Marsh Landing, El Segundo, Parish Peaker and Dover. Already, Marsh Landing has achieved completion and begun full commercial operation, and El Segundo is not far behind, still pushing towards an August 1 commercial operation date.","All these solar and conventional plants under construction and due for completion this year will contribute significant EBITDA, not only in 2014, when they should benefit from a full year of operation, but even in the second half of 2013, where their aggregate contribution is expected to exceed $300 million. Given the magnitude of this prospective financial contribution, I'm sure you can appreciate the intensity of our focus on the construction program, at all levels of the company.","Moving on to Slide 5. On a similar note, the other area of intense concentration, for me and for the rest of the executive management team, led by Anne Cleary, our Chief Integration Officer, has been on realizing all the benefits to be derived from the GenOn acquisition, which achieved financial closing just a short 4.5 months ago. I'm quite pleased with where we stand both quantitatively and qualitatively.","As demonstrated on Slide 4 -- or Slide 5, we have executed on the great majority of the cost synergies and balance sheet efficiencies previously identified, constituting $285 million out of the $310 million in total cash flow synergies estimated today. Importantly, even factoring in part-year effect and that 2013 is our transition year for this acquisition, we expect to realize $150 million of cost and operational synergies in fiscal year 2013, with most of that, $130 million, back-end loaded for obvious reasons.","You will note on Slide 6 that we have not yet upgraded our estimate of operational synergies to be realized from the GenOn acquisition. We intend to do so by the end of the second quarter. While we might be trying the patience of some of you in this regard, I want to point out that just 4.5 months ago, we acquired 21,400 megawatts of conventional generation in 155 generating units at 43 sites. We are evaluating each asset individually and methodically, not only the assets in our acquired portfolio but also each asset in our pre-existing fleet, to determine how to maximize asset value across the combined fleet.","The scope and potential significance of this operational synergy exercise is such that, on Slide 6, I provide some sense of the thorough process that we are going through and the results we are seeking. Importantly, we start by establishing a set of core principles that act as a guide to our decision-making process across all our assets in the combined fleet. This set of principles establishes what we refer to as our financial accretion framework, which, when all assets are evaluated in combination with each other, should result in significant shareholder value creation from the fleet taken as a whole.","When we do report to you the outcome and further details of our operational synergies effort, we will be focusing your attention on 3 sets of numbers. First and foremost, obviously, will be increased EBITDA arising from our operational synergies effort. Some of this EBITDA will be nonrecurring, but the greater part of it will be recurring EBITDA, rising over time.","Second, some of that revised operational synergy EBITDA will have no capital investment or material cost to achieve associated with it. But a portion of the improved EBITDA will require a certain amount of capital investment in order to realize on the synergy opportunity. We will provide details of the amount of incremental investment capital required and the quick payback period and the highly accretive multiples associated with it.","And third and finally, our operational synergy effort is likely to yield a meaningful free cash flow benefit somewhat separate and apart from the EBITDA impact. This free cash flow benefit will be achieved, in some instances, by rethinking suboptimal investments that had been previously planned. We look forward to sharing with you the details of our operational synergies plan before the end of this quarter, with the idea that we will begin prompt and forceful implementation virtually immediately thereafter.","With that, I'll hand it over to Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. During this first quarter, our focus was and continues to be on integrating the new GenOn assets, while delivering solid operational results across the fleet. I am pleased to say that both remain on track for the year. From a market perspective, we saw the gas storage surplus return to more normalized levels and, with that, an increase in gas prices, which, in turn, significantly reduced the coal-to-gas switching we experienced in the winter and spring of 2012. As always, safety is our #1 priority, and we posted another quarter of top decile performance. Our coal fleet improved its availability metrics, and as prices increased, so did the generation from our coal fleet.","One of our priorities is to optimize the overall spend of the combined fleet. To that end, today we're further reducing our estimated environmental capital plan by $100 million, from $630 million to $530 million over the planning period. This is a result of further testing and optimization of plant controls at our Big Cajun II plant, better equipment pricing at WA Parish and more efficient solutions at our Cheswick facility. This improvement, along with our previous announcement, now brings the total environmental capital reduction to approximately $200 million over the same time planning period. We will continue to focus on further optimizing our spend as part of our execution of operational synergies.","As David mentioned, 2013 is a critical year for our construction program, as we have several large projects reaching commercial operation, which, when all complete, will bring nearly 2.2 gigawatts of new generation online since 2012. On the conventional front, and starting with Marsh Landing, we achieved commercial operations on May 1. We are proud of the engineering and construction team delivering the project on time and on budget. The balance of our conventional projects, El Segundo, Parish and the Dover gas conversion project in Delaware, remain on budget and scheduled for operation this summer. Finally, our industry-leading utility-scale solar program remains largely on track to achieve commercial operations in 2013.","Turning to our operational metrics on Slide 9. We achieved another quarter of strong safety performance, with 92 facilities out of 105 without a recordable injury. We have combined 2 strong safety cultures, and while our first quarter recordable injury rate of 0.7 is top decile, given the increase from our 2012 record year, we have significant work to do as we head into the summer months.","Moving on to our generation for the quarter, we experienced much less coal-to-gas switching, and that is reflected in our numbers. After normalizing for generation related to the GenOn assets, generation increased by 23% as compared to last year, driven primarily by Texas and the Northeast regions.","STP Unit 2 came back to service on April 22, ahead of our previous estimates. During the forced shutdown, the full inspection of both turbines and associated feed pumps was completed in order to ensure that no other issues remain, and to prepare the unit for optimal summertime operation. As part of the program, the full 10-year inspections were completed on all turbines as they were disassembled for repair. There was no damage to the main generator or the exciter. Additionally, the replacement transformer was fully tested prior to being energized and have been carefully monitored since returning the unit to service. There were no significant issues arising from the completion of this work. Unit 2 is operating at full power with no evident threat to generation, and Unit 1 performed with a perfect record during the quarter.","Finally, coal availability improved compared to last year. Parish and Big Cajun led the way with over 90% availability. We are well on our way to complete the 154 outages planned for the first half of the year to ensure readiness for summer operations.","Moving to Slide 10. Our retail business performed within our expectations during the quarter with -- where we deliver $103 million of EBITDA. The quarter-over-quarter change was driven primarily by higher supply costs, weather impact and an increasing customer acquisition expense, as we organically grew customer count by 21,000 in the Northeast and Texas. Our efforts to continuously improve our operations have delivers us retail customer operations costs flat, while serving an average of 139,000 more customers during the same quarter from last year. In Texas, we were successful in maintaining unit margins while growing customer count. And in the Northeast we were able to increase our total gross margin by growing customer count despite lower unit margins.","In the mass market segment, we saw volume growth in both Texas and the Northeast. We continue to introduce innovative and compelling home services and sustainable smart energy solutions to support unique customer needs and extend our relationship with customers. Our multi-brand strategy, coupled with our product offerings, continues to differentiate us with customers and supports our strong momentum in the mass market.","In the C&I segment, we maintained discipline on pricing and margins, which led to a change in regional customer mix, with growth in our Northeast volumes and declines in Texas. We will continue to focus on delivering profitable operations in this intensely competitive segment. We are pleased with our performance, as we continue to hold the leadership position in Texas and now rank as the third largest competitive residential retailer in the country.","Turning to Slide 11. Most of you are familiar with the gas storage chart on the upper left, which is one indicator of -- for how tight the gas market has become. As you remember, in 2012, we left the withdrawal season with record storage levels, resulting in natural gas prices falling below $2 per MMBtu, which drove much higher gas demand through coal-to-gas switching.","This winter and spring have proven to be a different story. As you can see on the lower chart, gas storage rebalancing happened despite little coal-to-gas switching, and they are driven mostly by colder-than-normal weather in March and increases in demand. Strong gas prices reacted accordingly and moved to over $4 during the quarter, providing us an opportunity to increase our hedges in 2014. We expect gas prices to remain well supported through the rest of the year, above coal-to-gas switching economics.","Now looking into the ERCOT market. Over the past few quarters, we have focused this section to the long-term resource adequacy issues in Texas. We have laid out our case for higher heat rates and the possible solutions for closing the gap on the missing money needed to incentivize new generation. This time, I want to focus on looking at the upcoming summer months. A few days ago, ERCOT published their latest seasonal assessment with an expected peak load of over 68,000 megawatts, a 3% increase from last year.","There have been significant changes from last summer in terms of higher price caps and changes in the real time price formation rules that should lead to higher and more frequent scarcity periods. The current market implies some scarcity prices, as you can see on the upper right-hand chart. But if 2012 reserve margins are an indication of scarcity hours, we believe additional upside is warranted for this summer. We have taken the necessary steps to position our wholesale and retail portfolios to take advantage of this market opportunity.","Turning to Slide 12. As you can see on our hedging chart, we took advantage of the near-term increase in gas prices discussed earlier to layer in more hedges for 2014, bringing our hedge level up to 66%. This was on the heels of coal purchases we made earlier in the quarter, thereby closing both legs of the dark spread and staying balanced. In 2013, there was a decrease in the hedge percentage levels, but this is strictly due to an increase in projected economic generation, given higher prices later in the year.","Retail continues to execute their sales plan. We had live [ph]  price close to 80% of our retail low for the balance of the year. In New York, we took advantage of the recent increase in capacity prices due to asset retirement and changes in the reserve module requirements, and layered in significantly more hedges for the summer period.","During the quarter, results were impacted by the roll off of higher-priced hedges and increases in coal transportation costs relative to Q1 of 2012. These increased costs resulted from low river conditions in the Mississippi, which required us to use higher-cost alternative routes to Big Cajun. Also, our coal costs in Texas in 2013 year-to-date suffered by comparison to 2012, a year in which coal carriers provided us with extraordinary price flexibility during the extreme low-gas price environment that existed in early 2012. In addition, first quarter results were also impacted by the STP Unit 2 outage and commercial operation optimization activities.","As you know, we used a full suite of strategies and tools to capture both the intrinsic and extrinsic value of our portfolio, and our track record in this regard over the past several years has been generally very positive. In the first quarter of 2013, our commercial optimization activities were not as successful as in the past and contributed to the drag on year-over-year financial performance in our wholesale business segment.","Finally, our focus on integration efforts continue in this respect. I am very pleased to note that we consolidated the real-time dispatch function for the Northeast and West region into our Princeton control center, a key milestone as we head into the summer months.","With that, I will turn things over to Kirk for the financial review.","Kirkland B. Andrews","Thanks, Mauricio. Beginning with the financial summary on Slide 14, NRG is reporting first quarter 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $373 million, with $234 million from wholesale, $103 million from retail and $36 million from our solar projects. Our quarterly results include the impact of the GenOn transaction, which primarily contributed to $160 million in quarter-over-quarter adjusted EBITDA growth in our East region.","First quarter results also reflect the impact of nonrecurring items, including higher coal cost, primarily in our South Central region, related to the need to secure alternative coal transport due to unusually low river levels, which have now returned to normal, and the outage of STP Unit 2, which, as Mauricio said, returned to service on April 22. These items, combined with unrealized losses from commercial optimization activities, reduced first quarter EBITDA by approximately $60 million.","Looking ahead, we're affirming adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2013 and 2014, which will see a significant ramp-up in EBITDA from increasing synergy realizations and newly completed solar and conventional projects.","Moving to free cash flow. We are increasing our 2013 guidance by $100 million, while maintaining our free cash flow guidance for 2014.","Turning to capital allocation in 2013. As we have announced in February, NRG substantially achieved its $1 billion debt reduction objective in connection with the GenOn transaction, significantly strengthening our consolidated balance sheet. Having captured over 90% of the $100 million in annual free cash flow from balance sheet efficiencies announced in connection with the merger, we expect to achieve or exceed this target later in the year. We also increased our dividend by 1\/3 and have begun our $200 million share buyback program, with $25 million of stock repurchased during the quarter at a weighted average price of $25.88.","Turning briefly to the guidance overview on Slide 15. As I just mentioned, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA and increasing our free cash flow before growth in 2013 by $100 million. Last month, we received an $80 million tax refund we had previously anticipated to receive in 2014. The acceleration of this cash flow item, combined primarily with the reduction in projected environmental capital expenditures, allowed us to increase 2013 cash flow before growth guidance, while maintaining our prior guidance for 2014.","Turning to Slide 16. While the first quarter saw $36 million in solar EBITDA and gave us the first $20 million of the full synergistic power of our combination with GenOn, the bulk of the EBITDA from our construction program and synergy realization efforts is yet to come over the balance of the year, more than $400 million over the remainder of 2013, leading to $750 million, in the aggregate, in 2014 and beyond.","Breaking this down, NRG expects an additional $130 million in EBITDA synergies from the GenOn merger during 2013, leading to a run rate of $210 million for 2014. As David mentioned earlier, we look forward to sharing with you the potential expansion of this number and the benefits -- as the benefits of our operational synergy efforts related to the merger are realized.","In addition, over the remainder of the year, we also expect over $100 million in EBITDA in 2013 and more than $200 million in 2014 from our conventional projects, having already placed our Marsh Landing project in service earlier this month. Finally, as most of our solar projects achieved COD over the balance of the year, we will see an additional $107 million in 2013, growing to over $300 million in 2014.","Turning to corporate liquidity on Slide 17. NRG's liquidity decreased by $277 million in the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to the completion of our $1 billion delevering target following the GenOn merger. As anticipated on the last quarterly call, the financings of our solar investments resulted in a net return of capital, as we drew on the Alpine and Borrego financings, totaling over $300 million, once the project hit COD during the quarter. These financings, combined with cash grant receipts, exceeded NRG's equity investments during the quarter.","Finally, updating our capital allocation progress on Slide 18. NRG ended 2012 with an excess cash balance of $1.062 billion net of targeted cash balances and certain cash not currently distributable from excluded project subsidiaries. This excess cash balance, when combined with NRG's increased 2013 free cash flow before growth investment guidance, now leads us to $2.62 (sic) [$2.062] billion to $2.262 billion in cash available for allocation in 2013. Our growth investments guidance of $226 million for 2013 remains unchanged, as we are on track to complete our Tier 1 solar construction and conventional projects.","In addition, we completed our open-market bond repurchase program during the first quarter, retiring $200 million in NRG corporate debt at a cost of $226 million including premiums. Having declared our first increased quarterly dividend, we expect $145 million in common stock dividends paid to shareholders in 2013, which, when combined with our $200 million share repurchase program, will result in nearly $350 million in return of capital to shareholders this year.","Capital allocated to acquisitions consists of the remaining integration costs associated with the GenOn merger, the purchase of the Gregory co-gen plant expected to close in the third quarter, as well as the acquisition and COD of the High Desert solar facility, which closed during the first quarter. After successfully balancing the allocation of a portion of our 2013 excess cash among return of shareholder capital, prudent balance sheet management and growth opportunities from new construction and acquisitions, we are left with a substantial surplus, providing NRG with ongoing excess liquidity and capital flexibility.","With our balance sheet metrics in line with targets and our credit rating stable and affirmed, given the continuing robust conditions in the debt markets, we would expect any further capital allocated to delevering to be opportunistic in nature. We will also seek opportunities to take advantage of the robust conditions in the debt markets via accretive refinancings, including a potential additional term lender [ph]  pricing, which would further contribute to balance sheet efficiency savings in 2013.","Given the breadth and diversity of the NRG platform, we continue to actively evaluate opportunities to further enhance shareholder value through acquisitions, focused on conventional power generation, the enhancement of our retail business and our growing leadership position in clean energy. We continue to remain flexible regarding the potential for enhanced or different capital allocation should market conditions evolve.","Now I'll turn it back to David for his closing remarks.","David W. Crane","Thank you, Kirk, and thank you, Mauricio. Steve, I think we'll just take it straight to questions if you want to open the floor.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question coming from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you have a breakdown of the -- I think, the number your said was negative $60 million of EBITDA of nonrecurring items between STP, South Central and commercial optimization in the quarter. And specifically, can you explain in a bit more detail what happened with commercial optimization?","David W. Crane","Kirk, why don't you start?","Kirkland B. Andrews","Sure. In terms of the breakdown, approximately $28 million was from commercial optimization activities. The STP outage during the quarter resulted in about $25 million and the remainder of that was from the coal transport costs.","David W. Crane","Mauricio, do you want to -- or Chris, do you want to or not want to give more guidance?","Christopher S. Moser","Got it. Neil, apologies, but we haven't had a history, and we don't intend to now, of discussing any specific strategies or tools that we use on that side. So I'm going to leave it there.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And then my second question was around capital allocation. Are you more likely to grow organically or via acquisition, in your view, from here? Should we think of Gregory as the flavor of M&A from here, one-off acquisitions that are tactical and opportunistic, or are a fleet of assets still in the cards?","David W. Crane","Well, Neil, just -- because I like to answer questions literally and accurately, your question sort of shifted from the beginning to the end. I mean, on the organic versus inorganic, one of the things that I always liked about this company is that we're constantly having our own opportunities to grow the business from within and those require capital. Historically, less capital less soon than, obviously, acquisitions, but it's nice to have an organic growth strategy, and we have that both on our conventional side and on our renewable side. In terms of acquisitions, I don't think that you can really sense a pattern from Gregory. I know that you know from previous comments, we've always said that we feel that we have more of a competitive advantage, in terms of acquisitions, on bigger transactions rather than fewer, in large part because there are just fewer buyers on the bigger stuff and we can get sort of more cost synergies out of the bigger things and, certainly, some of the financial buyers. So Gregory was -- I can't remember when was the last time we were successful on a one-asset acquisition, but we were pleased with the price we paid and we're very pleased with the asset. On the generation side, we're -- we are looking across the single-asset portfolio company side, but the only thing that would cause Gregory to be more the future than bigger deals is there are just fewer bigger things out there that may be available to us and may be appealing to us.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I'm going to try to rephrase this question and avoid commercially sensitive territory. But, Mauricio, on the extrinsic capture in Q1, was there a structural change in the market, or is this kind of normal quarter-to-quarter volatility in that capture ratio or rate?","Mauricio Gutierrez","No, Brandon, that's a -- I mean, that's a good observation. I mean, you can have quarter-on-quarter changes that not ultimately reflects the overall profitability of the position that we take. And I think that was -- that is the case in a lot of the optimization strategies that we utilize to fully extract the value of the portfolio.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, Mauricio, just following on that. 14 gas hedges, you did take some incremental down, perhaps it would be a wish that you took even more down. Is there any embedded gas view in how much it would be for GAAP for '14 on the gas side?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. I mean, keep in mind that 2014, we actually layer in significant amount of hedges. But as you can appreciate with gas prices moving up, so are our economic generation. So the move from 59% last quarter to 66%, if everything else would have -- being constant, it would have been higher. Keep in mind that we just had more generation, I guess, in the money. And it is consistent with our strategic hedging program and our fundamental view. When we saw the price increase in the first quarter, we felt that it was a good opportunity to lock in additional hedges. And as I said, close the dark spread that we initiated early in the year, where we saw an opportunity to buy incremental coal, and we did it. And we believe that we're going to have additional opportunities to do that throughout the year.","Christopher S. Moser","Brandon, this is Chris Moser. And just to add to that, I would mention that if you're comparing how many -- how much it takes for us to move from 59% to 66% today versus this time last year, it's a much bigger -- we have to sell a lot more to get there, and now we're not quite double what we were before. So -- and not to mention the fact that gas is moving up and our deltas were moving up. The entire -- to move the portfolio 5% to 7% is also just a much bigger outright sale that has to happen. So just to give you that perspective as well.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first quick question, just to clarify. This is on plan for the year, the first quarter. And perhaps could you speak to just layering of hedges throughout the year? Obviously, Texas is becoming a \"peak year market.\" How do you think about that with respect to your hedging program? And then perhaps the second question here off the bat, is what's going on in California, just given the year-on-year trends? Is there anything else that we should be paying attention to?","David W. Crane","Yes, well, let me just knock off the second one first because it's easy. I like to take the easy questions, Julien, and then give Mauricio a little more time for the slightly more challenging. On California, I don't think there's anything more you can read into it. I believe if you go back and look at actually GenOn's first quarter results from last year, you'll see a negative result for first quarter of 2012. And I know that's counterintuitive, given that the fleet has basically tripled in size in California. But the contracts that people have in California are extremely shaped towards summer revenue. So it looks unusual, but it's not something that we're overly worried about.","Mauricio Gutierrez","And with respect to the -- I guess, the hedging strategy around Texas, Julien, as you know, we try to look at the natural gas caging [ph]  activity or the natural gas component of our portfolios, one, and the heat rates. So with respect to the natural gas component, we tried to lock in as much of the dark spread or baseload gross margin that we have in our portfolio. And certainly, with heat rates, we've been talking about increasing heat rates, given the regulatory changes in our -- to incentivize new-build economics. And that has paid out dividends for us over the past couple of years. Now with respect to the balance of the year, your point about the distribution of the gross margin of the portfolio is correct. I mean, we're seeing much peakier prices in the summer. Q3 is becoming more important relative to the other quarters, and we have taken the necessary steps to benefit from that. We are leaving a long-biased position on our portfolio. We have also increased the hedging on our retail portfolio to better manage or to increase the insurance around volumetric risk or weather risk. So we believe that the portfolio is well positioned to benefit from what we believe is going to be a very tight summer in Texas.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And just entirely separately, quickly here, on solar, you alluded to solar monetizations, broadly speaking. How are you thinking about it? Obviously, we've seen some other peers of yours moving to spin their own businesses. Is that something you'd contemplate at some point?","David W. Crane","Well, Julien, what I'd say is that we've contemplated everything. I mean, this has been an exhaustive process. We've looked at all the options. We're aware of everything that's going on in the marketplace, at least everything that's visible in the marketplace. And I just -- I alluded to it pretty directly and pretty explicitly, that we would be back to you on this topic before the end of second quarter. I just don't know what else I can tell you, other than just wait a few weeks and the long wait will be over.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Keith Stanley from Deutsche Bank.","Keith Stanley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you talk to the level of retail margins and attrition you've seen year-to-date, specific to the existing residential customers in Texas, and how you expect this to evolve over the course of the year? It seems like you guys are still fairly confident with retail guidance for '13 and '14, reaffirmed despite higher gas prices now.","David W. Crane","Keith, let -- I'm going to ask Elizabeth Killinger, who runs that business, to answer that question for you.","Elizabeth Killinger","Yes. We've seen sustained margins, as Mauricio mentioned, in Texas. We've sustained our unit margins and believe we're well positioned, both from a selling perspective on acquiring new customers, as well as retaining others using the new channels that we have, as well as innovative products that we're launching to intrigue customers to recognize we're different, whether it's providing home services or providing just the standard commodity plan.","Keith Stanley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And one quick clarification on the operational merger synergies. Do you expect to provide an update before the end of Q2 as in June 30, or as part of the Q2 earnings call?","David W. Crane","That's a good clarification, but -- before the end of -- before June 30, before the end of the quarter.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to touch on PJM and the outlook for heat rates in that market. There's quite a bit of debate about the impact of coal plant retirements over time to heat rate. As you look out at the market now, what's your view in terms of whether there is further heat rate movement likely or whether you see headwinds, be it from renewables, lack of demand growth or whatever the case may be?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Stephen, this as Mauricio. I think on the last quarter, we tried to, at least, quantify what would be the impact on heat rates and that potential upside, given the retirements that we're expecting due to MACT in 2015 and the New Jersey head. I think we said somewhere in the order of magnitude of $4 to $5 per megawatt hour, just to get to cost of new entry economics. Clearly, that's going to depend on the capacity revenues or the capacity auction results, that we will see later in the month, that will fill the gap to incentivize that -- the new generation that is expected to be required in the '16 to '17 timeframe. So our view hasn't changed dramatically from that. We are expecting somewhat more volatility and, potentially, some upside this summer, given that demand response will potentially set price going into effect this summer. So I would say that that's the short term and the longer-term view that we have in PJM.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And just as a follow-up on a different matter. David, you talked about the solar and we'll stay tuned on that, but you have a number of other contracted conventional assets that are relatively bond-like in terms of their cash flows over time. Could you just talk to your general views as to appetite to monetize some of those, given that they are so bond-like and maybe there are fires do it [ph] effectively, put a higher multiple on that than what's reflected in your own stock?","David W. Crane","Well, Steve, I mean, it's a good question. I'm not sure I ever heard to our contracted assets talk to as bond-like, but I can see your point. Yes -- no, I mean, it's something we're aware of that -- I mean, particularly with the new projects being brought online this year that are contracted, that the company's balance of -- on the wholesale side between assets that are -- what would be characterized as merchant versus contracted is moving more towards the contracted. And I think whether or not the market -- its volume and such is an open question. So certainly, it's something that we have under evaluation.","Operator","And that question is from the line of Angie Storozynski.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","So let me ask the question that everybody is probably dying to ask. So we're waiting for the PJM capacity auction. We're hoping to hear about some of the changes to the recently acquired GenOn portfolio. You're suggesting that we're going to hear those -- about those changes or any updates in June, which sounds like after the auction. Should we -- does it -- I mean, should we imply that, basically, some of the CapEx that you might be talking about is contingent on clearing in this auction. And also, if you're willing at all to say what are your expectations for the auction, that would be great.","David W. Crane","Well, Angie, I can't imagine that we're going to answer that question in any substantive way.","Christopher S. Moser","Well, I could -- I can touch the various...","David W. Crane","Okay. Does anybody want to have anything to add to what Angie just said?","Christopher S. Moser","You got it. This is Chris. I think in the last earnings call, Mauricio mentioned that our outlook on the PJM auction, I think we covered that already. I think the one piece I'll throw out there is that, with Kirk just doing the MOPA ruling last week, I think that we've -- that was part of our calculations and kind of -- we're disappointed about it, but it was within our expectations. So I don't think it changes what we said in the last earnings call. That's about -- that's all I've got incrementally [ph].","David W. Crane","Angie, do you want to ask a different question?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","But is it fair to assume that you're waiting with any updates on coal CapEx or conversions of coal plants until that auction happens?","David W. Crane","Angie, I can swear that, that question is identical to the question that you just asked 30 seconds before. And this isn't the Austin Powers movie. If you ask the same question 3 times, we're not going to answer it either the first, second or third time that you ask it. Is there a different question, Angie, that you'd like to ask?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","How about maybe -- you mentioned the potential M&A target.","David W. Crane","That's really a good path you're going down there. So what's your question there?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Can you tell us versus which region you would be focused on? Roughly speaking, is it more of Texas or is it more Northeast? Is it PJM?","David W. Crane","It's interesting, Angie, that you asked that question, because I would say, compared to the past and the 10 years I've been here before, where we used to talk about the fact that we would like a bigger base portfolio in PJM and there was the time when we would talk about how we really needed a load-falling [ph]  asset down in South Central. Pretty much in terms of the real needs of the generation portfolio, we like where we are. I mean, we bounced away from Texas a little bit. And obviously, you can tell in the first quarter this year that, that helped us already. So to us, we're -- one, as we consider things, it's very much look for value where there's value to be obtained. We have no intrinsic desire to expand our geographic footprint from where we are. But if we could do that at extraordinary value, we would consider that as well. But -- so I think there is nothing that you need to be concerned about that we're going to reach out to and sort of pay a big number for and then sort of try and justify it on the grounds that it was strategic. Boy, well, I thought that was a good answer. I mean, did you not like that answer? The disappointment in your voice is palpable, Angie. So I'm not sure that that's the best way to end the quarterly earnings call, but given that we have to hold you to the 2 questions protocol.","Steve, operator, I think that's it. So, everyone, we very much appreciate you taking the time to be on this call. And as I've mentioned at least a couple of times now, we don't know exactly the forum that we're going to be speaking to you but we expect to speak to you on at least 2 topics before the end of the second quarter, which we defined as the last day in June.","So thank you very much, and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day."],"16371":["NRG Energy, Inc.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Kevin Cole. You may begin. ","Kevin Cole","Thank you, Lateef. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings call. This morning\u2019s call is scheduled for 45 minutes in length and is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast, which can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations & Webcasts.","Please note that today\u2019s discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the Safe Harbor in today\u2019s presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events except as required by law.","In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today\u2019s presentation.","And now with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG\u2019s President and CEO.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I am joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass Business; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.","Over the past 3.5 years we have made significant progress in transforming our company from a traditional IPP to an integrated power company focused on our customers. We monetized our excess generation and rebalanced our portfolio. We streamlined our operations. We slashed our debt. We achieved our targeted credit metrics. We are perfecting our business to make it more stable. And through all of these efforts, we created tremendous financial flexibility. ","As you can see, we have come a long way and I am very pleased with our progress and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. However, the recent stock price performance does not reflect our confidence in the resiliency of our integrated model to deliver predictable and robust results. Our confidence in the business remains absolutely unchanged. We will continue to demonstrate the value of our business year-after-year. ","So with that on Slide 3, we have outlined the key messages for today's presentation. First, our business delivered another quarter of stable results demonstrating the value of our integrated platform during a period of volatile prices. And today, we are reaffirming our full year financial guidance. Second, we continue to perfect our integrated platform with the acquisition of Stream Energy and the execution of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of solar PPA generator. And third, we're making good progress on our capital allocation plan. ","During the quarter, we fully completed our debt reduction program and we have finally achieved our targeted investment grade credit metrics. In addition, we are announcing an incremental $250 million share repurchase program, which brings our total 2019 share repurchases to $1.5 billion. ","Moving to the financial and operational results for the second quarter on Slide 4, we achieved top decile safety performance and delivered $469 million of adjusted EBITDA. The second quarter results were driven primarily by higher wholesale power prices, offset by higher retail supply costs and mild weather, demonstrating the complementary nature of our Generation and Retail businesses. ","On the right hand side of the slide, similar to last quarter, we have provided our EBITDA on a same-store basis adjusted for asset sales and the consolidations. As you can see, for the first half of the year, our business delivered $801 million or 7% higher than last year. Now beyond these financials, we made significant [Technical Difficulty] further perfecting the stability and predictability of our platform. We launched our previously announced capital-light strategy signing approximately 1.3 gigawatts of solar PPA generator at an average length of 10 years, which complements our Generation portfolio, allows us to better serve our customers and further balances our integrated platform. ","In addition, we closed on the acquisition of Stream Energy. This acquisition increases our national multi-brand retail leadership position and adds more than 600,000 Residential Customer Equivalents or RCEs with a run rate EBITDA of $65 million. We also achieved our investment grade credit metrics by reducing our total debt by $600 million and executed on a number of transactions in the debt markets at very attractive levels. This completes our balance sheet strengthening program and Kirk will provide additional details in his section. ","Also during the quarter, we completed the latest $1 billion share repurchase program, bringing our total year-to-date to $1.25 billion. In addition, we are announcing an incremental $250 million share repurchase program to be completed by year end. We will address our plans for the remaining $259 million of 2019 excess cash, as we usually do, on the third quarter earnings call. However, we\u2019re reserving up to a $124 million of this capital for the Petra Nova project. ","Let me give you some context. Back in 2014, when we closed the financing for this project, NRG and our 50-50 partner JX Nippon provided a financial guarantee to Petra Nova\u2019s lenders. These guarantees were to remain in place to support a one-time debt service ratio test which proscribe a prepayment of principal in the event the ratio fell below the threshold. ","We have been in active negotiation with the project lenders and we now expect to fund the prepayment in the third quarter. Although, the final prepayment amount has not yet been determined, our obligation is limited to the guarantee amount. Once the debt prepayment is made, the guarantee will terminate and the remaining debt will become non-recourse to NRG. ","So now moving on to our summer update on Slide 5, I wanted to provide you a brief update on the position of our integrated model, even though we are only in the middle of the summer. As you can see on the left hand side, second quarter weather was milder than normal particularly in June which impacted both prices and loads. Our portfolio so far is performing well. ","Starting with Retail, as expected load. We\u2019re also providing energy conversation alerts and demand management programs which help consumers manage load during peak hours. The milder weather during the second quarter has resulted in lower volumes. Unlike any other consumer business, if we sell less of our product, it will impact our results. ","For Generation, we are maintaining excess length to help ensure against unplanned outages and load spikes. We expanded our pre-summer maintenance program to ensure our units can withstand increased run times. And we returned to service our Gregory plant, a 385 megawatt combined cycle plant which provides additional reliability to our platform and to the ERCOT system ahead of this tight summer. ","Given [how rich] is our portfolio, we expect to have limited exposure to price or volumetric risk. I know we\u2019re only halfway through the summer, and as we\u2019re seeing this week, ERCOT is in the middle of a high-load high volatility period, with the rest of August still ahead of us. We remain focused across the organization on ensuring reliable operations and a successful summer. ","Now turning to Slide 6, I want to provide you an update on the ERCOT market. The supply demand balance remained tightened than it has never been, given strong load growth, previous asset retirements and lack of newbuilds. In May ERCOT released their semiannual Capacity Demand and Research report or CDR, which outlines the expected supply demand balance in the system and is shown in the upper left side of this slide. ","As you can see, future reserve margins are dependent on newbuilds, particularly wind and solar. While the CDR report is helpful in understanding what is planned or possible, it has historically been a poor indicator of what actually gets build in the current year. In fact, we have seen less than 50% of renewal project included in the CDR reports completed. ","And a closer look at the report reveal that 1.7 gigawatts are included from three natural gas plants that have already been delayed by an average of five years with no signs of moving forward. The report also does not yet include nearly 1.4 gigawatts of thermal generation that has already announced plans to retire. Together, these accounts put 4% of the reserve margin. Keep in mind that a little more than half of the 7 gigawatts of solar included in the report have posted financial security for interconnection. ","In the table on the lower left hand side, we tried to adjust for some of these factors and estimate what is the amount of megawatts required from solar to maintain a reserve margin of 10% to 12%. As you can see in the table we estimate over 17 gigawatts of new renewables are necessary to achieve those reserve margins in the next three years. We see this as a challenging given our recent experience signing solar PPAs and the backward dated forward power prices. Let me be clear, the ERCOT needs a tremendous amount of investment to just simply maintain the low reserve margin it currently has.","Now from a platforms perspective, we\u2019re looking to facilitate solar newbuilds to improve grid reliability and rebalance our portfolio by entering into medium term PPAs. This PPAs help enable the developers to obtain cost-effective financing and tax equity to economically develop the project. And for us, they complement our generation profile, lower our cost structure and allows us to better serve our customers.","From a market perspective, we expect ERCOT to remain tight and volatile for the foreseeable future, even in the face of a large renewable build-up. This price environment should prove difficult for pure retailers or generators that will be exposed to swings in the market. Our integrated platform is well positioned to thrive during this volatile and emerging renewable newbuild cycle. And you can expect us to deliver strong and predictable results. ","I want to give one last comment regarding our markets. As you all know FERC issued an order earlier this month directing PJM to delay the August capacity auction. While we\u2019re hopeful a final order will be issued by the end of the year, the timeline FERC action remains uncertain. ","We continue to view a strong MOPR at the simplest and most cost effective way to reduce the harmful impact of subsidies on the capacity market. ","And as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have come a long way in achieving our goals. ","Slide 7 summarizes how we have transformed our business. We have significantly rebalanced our portfolio and streamlined our operations. Today, we have two complementary encounter cyclical businesses that provides a stable and predictable earnings under various market conditions. ","We are focused on perfecting our business and making it even more stable with the generation fleet that supports our retail operations. The more balanced we are, the less exposure we have to the market and the more synergies we can achieve between the two businesses by crossing more Generation with Retail. ","We are no longer your traditional IPP exposed to the feast and famine of power cycles. By having deliberately changed the risk profile of our business, we have also realigned our balance sheet and achieved investment grade credit metrics. ","Now, our focus will turn into achieving investment grade rating. We recognize that this business model is relatively new but we\u2019re working hard to demonstrate the stability of our platform. ","Finally, we have created tremendous financial flexibility of our business with our actions. Now, with our deleveraging program behind us, we will focus our excess cash in 2020 and beyond on perfecting our model and returning capital to our shareholders. ","With that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review. ","Kirk Andrews","Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to financial summary on Slide 9 for the second quarter NRG delivered $469 million in adjusted EBITDA and $230 million in consolidated free cash flow before growth. This brings total adjusted EBITDA for the first half of the year to $801 million. As we did last quarter we provided a walk from our first half 2018 results to 2019 to provide some additional details behind the year-over-year drivers for our results. ","Starting with our first half 2018 results we again eliminate the impact of asset sales, retirements and deconsolidations from our prior year\u2019s results. Deducting the $103 million impact of these items from 2018 results provides a baseline for comparison to our reported results for the first half of this year. Year-to-date our results are positively impacted by incremental savings and margin enhancements from the transformation plan which positively impact results by $66 million versus the prior year. ","Next, year-to-date Retail results are $123 million lower primarily due to higher costs which impacted gross margins with the remaining variance coming from XOOM Energy which closed June 1st of last year and weather as 2018 saw a positive benefit while the milder weather through June negatively impacted our 2019 Retail results, leading to a $35 million year-over-year impact. ","Year-to date Generation results were $108 million higher as more robust wholesale prices drove higher gross margins, offsetting the opposite impact of supply costs out of Retail, further validating the effectiveness of the integrated model. ","Behind the higher wholesale -- beyond the higher wholesale price impact rather, higher emissions credit sales in 2018 were offset by the benefit of the Midwest Generation asbestos settlement in 2019. While we increased major maintenance expenditures in 2019 to ensure our Texas fleet, including the Gregory plant, was fully prepared for reliable operations ahead of the valuable summer months. ","With our strong outlook for the summer together with our significant hedge position for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2019 guidance ranges of $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion in EBITDA and $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion of free cash flow. While we're maintaining our ranges for the subcomponents of our businesses as well, given year-to-date results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, Retail results are more likely to trend below the midpoint while Generation is trending above its midpoint. ","As in years past, we expect the bulk of our EBITDA to come in the third quarter, which consistent with past performance is expected to represent more than 40% of our annual results. We will update and narrow our guidance ranges on third quarter earnings call. ","During the second quarter we deployed over $1 billion in excess capital continuing to return capital to shareholders as well as achieving our balance sheet targets. Specifically, we completed the remaining $500 million of our share repurchase program announced on our fourth quarter earnings call, bringing year-to-date share repurchases to $1.25 billion, reducing share count by over 10% or 32 million shares at an average price of $38.80. ","And as Mauricio mentioned earlier, we are announcing an additional $250 million share repurchase program, which brings total 2019 capital allocated to share repurchases to $1.5 billion. This past quarter we also successfully executed a number of transactions in the debt markets through which we completed $600 million in debt reduction in order to achieve our target investment grade metrics, extended our nearest maturities and significantly reduced our interest costs.","Part of our refinancing included repaying our secured term loan in its entirety using both the $600 million in cash with the balance funded with the new secured notes. These new secured notes contain fall-away covenants which automatically release the collateral, making the notes unsecured upon NRG receiving investment grade ratings from two ratings agencies. This covenant feature allows us a clear path to ensure the profile of our balance sheet aligns with that of investment grade without the need for additional refinancings in order to do so. Our refinancing and debt reduction activities this past quarter in total will also result in over $25 million in annual interest savings. ","And turning to Slide 10 for an update on capital allocation. With our refinancing activities during the second quarter, we have completed the allocation of 2019 capital toward improving our balance sheet, enabling the achievement of our targeted investment grade metrics and further improving our overall maturity profile. Our new $250 million share repurchase program announced today brings total capital allocated to return of shareholder capital to over $1.5 billion in 2019 or more than 50% of 2019\u2019s excess capital returned to shareholders. ","On August 1st we close the Stream Energy retail transaction which including transaction costs and working capital adjustments totaled $325 million. With the closing Stream and our new $250 million share repurchase program, based on the midpoint of our reaffirmed guidance, we expect approximately $250 million in 2019 capital remained to be allocated as we generate the remainder of our free cash flow over the balance of the year. ","As Mauricio mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we now expect to finalize the contractually required one-time leverage test for our Petra Nova project which provides a formula for press-forward payment in the event the debt service ratio falls below defined minimum threshold. Having successfully extended the deadline for this one-time test originally scheduled for 2018, as the operator of the oilfield had taken steps to improve production, our expectation was the extended timeline would allow time for the ratio to exceed the threshold and avoid a delay in repayment. ","As the year progressed, despite the production improvement initiatives, oilfield production continued to lag expectations. And based on our latest discussions with the lenders and the updated reserve forecast they provide, we are now unable to further extend the deadline to allow more time for improvement and expect that this test will result in NRG being required to fund our 50% share of the required prepayment in the third quarter. ","Although the exact prepayment amount is not yet finalized, NRG\u2019s obligation could be up to $124 million or 50% of the project\u2019s debt. As a result, up to $124 million of our remaining excess capital is now reserved to fund this obligation during the third quarter. Following prepayment of the Petra Nova debt which is not consolidated on NRG\u2019s balance sheet, the guarantee supporting contingent prepayment obligation has been eliminated and any remaining debt is non-recourse to NRG. ","Finally, turning to Slide 11, with our targeted deleveraging now complete, NRG\u2019s total debt is now under $6 billion or approximately $5.4 billion net of our -- of only our target $500 million minimum cash balance. That of course assumes that all capital is fully allocated. ","Based on the midpoint of our 2019, EBITDA guidance displaces us at the midpoint of our targeted investment grade credit metric range or 2.625 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Including our full year\u2019s run rate EBITDA contribution from the Stream Energy acquisition, this ratio reaches the lower ratio of our investment grade metric range or approximately 2.5 times, placing us in even stronger balance sheet position as we move into 2020. ","And I\u2019ll turn it back to you Mauricio.","Mauricio Gutierrez","Thank you, Kirk. Turning to Slide 13, I want to provide you a few closing thoughts. During the quarter we made significant progress on our priorities of perfecting our platform, maintaining a sector appropriate capital structure and disciplined capital allocation. ","Today, I'm pleased with the conclusion of our nearly four year chapter of strengthening our balance sheet. I want to thank Kirk and the entire team for their relentless discipline in getting us to a best-in-industry investment grade balance sheet. ","The financial flexibility that we enjoy today enabled us to further perfect our platform for the recent acquisition of Stream Energy, pursue our capital-light PPA strategy, and take advantage of the current [dislocated] stock price through incremental share repurchases. NRG is clearly stronger than it has ever been. We now have the stability and financial flexibility to thrive and take advantage of opportunities through all market cycles. ","So with that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. Lateef, we're now ready to open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","I wanted to first ask you about the solar PPA announcements. That\u2019s certainly very interesting strategic decision here. How are you thinking about scaling these commitments over time, both with respect to PPAs rather than necessarily owning assets outright? And then secondly, probably relatively more critically, how do you think about this shifting your perspectives on further build out of solar in Texas? Certainly we hear a variety of different viewpoints out there. You are not necessarily using your balance sheet obviously, but you are seeing other developers pivot. How do you think about that and the state of the portfolio you have?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes. Well, first of all, I am very pleased with the execution of this capital-light strategy. Kudos to the origination team. As we\u2019ve disclosed today, we closed on 1.3 gigawatts. That\u2019s a good progress. But what I can tell you is that we continue to be in the market executing on additional volumes. Our goal is to complement the existing Generation portfolio that we have to better match our Retail load. So when you think about how much more you need to think about the Retail load as the guideline on how much we're going to complement more our Generation portfolio either through solar PPAs or other efficient ways of acquiring I guess length or Generation. ","Now we respect to the solar, the second question that you had around the solar view, what we wanted to do is to illustrate, if we were to maintain a 10% to12% reserve margin which we think is the minimal to have reliable operations over the long-term, we wanted to put it in the context of how much solar you will need. And as you can see, it\u2019s a pretty significant number over 17 gigawatts, including solar and wind. I can't tell you whether it\u2019s going to be one or the other or if the pricing in those will change that will make thermal generation or conventional generation being built. What I can tell you is that ERCOT needs a lot of generation. It needs a lot of investment. And even the number that we\u2019re providing you are only sufficient to maintain a -- the current load reserve margin that we have. I think that\u2019s the main point that we were making. Obviously the implication of that is we expect the ERCOT market to continue to be robust over the foreseeable future, but more importantly to be pretty volatile. And we know that our business does well when we have both lot of volatility and perhaps less of other robustness because we have really reduced our exposure to market by balancing our Generation and Retail businesses.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","And then if could just follow up here real quickly. Strategically, we've seen some comments from your peers of late about their views about the depressed market environment and valuations. Anything comparable that you would offer at this point, I mean just with respect to your differing business models and take private scenarios et cetera. Just any commentary there?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, that\u2019s a lot of questions in one question Julien so let me see if I can just touch that. The integrated model or our view on how we are positioning our company given the market trends that we\u2019re all serving today, and I'm glad you\u2019re asking that because I do believe that we actually have a very unique and differentiated platform. As I mentioned to you our goal is to better balance our generation in our retail businesses. I mean these are two complementary and counter-cyclical business. So to the extent that we match them better they may become even more complementary on a relative basis. ","Now when I say better balance, it also brings other benefits. We can actually increase the matching internally between our Generation and Retail which maximizes the synergies that we have talked about now for 10 years, collateral synergies friction cost synergies. To the extent that we better match those two, we reduced our exposure to the market. I mean we will continue to interact with the market but we don\u2019t necessarily have to if it\u2019s perfectly matched, which makes our platform a lot more stable which is one of the goals that we\u2019re trying to achieve with this new integrated platform, stable and predictable earnings. ","If you look at the better balance, we have, as I said, more complementary and it\u2019s important on a relative basis. So if you think about where we were let\u2019s say five years ago when our Generation business was outsized from our Retail business, we actually got excess generation and that excess generation was exposed to wholesale power prices. Now we have reduced that significantly. I'm not saying that\u2019s good or bad, all I'm saying is that that\u2019s not the model that we\u2019re pursuing. We\u2019re pursuing a model that is a lot more balanced than it has ever been.","Now from a dynamics standpoint, when you have a more integrated portfolio like we do in a rising commodity price environment, obviously our Generation margins will increase and our Retail margins will slightly decrease. And when the commodity prices are declining, the opposite happens. Our Generation margins decreased and our Retail margins increase. What I can tell you is that we actually have a lot more degrees of freedom in terms of how much of the wholesale price increases or decreases we can actually pass to our customers. ","We know having been in the business now for over 10 years with empirical data that consumers, that the wholesale price is only one factor that consumers take into consideration but it is not the only factor. If that was the case, we would not have seen the growth that we have experienced in any of the premium brands that right now exists in the market. So I mean I hope that, that at least provides you a -- I guess perhaps a slightly different perspective on how I think about how we\u2019re repositioning the company going forward. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ","Greg Gordon ","A couple of blocking and tackling questions first. When I look at slide -- in the back of the slide deck, Slide 33, your guidance for cash flow from operations and free cash flow before growth is unchanged and it has $95 million working capital assumption for the year. But in the quarter, there was a fairly large working -- collateral postings on Slide 35, it says 246. So is that basically expected to reverse out over the year, can you give us some -- and full year guidance is still okay? ","Kirk Andrews","Greg, it\u2019s Kirk. That\u2019s correct. I mean typically speaking we're in the sort of middle of our collateral or liquidity intensive period. There is always the cases we come through the summer and enter into the fall that\u2019s when we tend to get that collateral back from those postings or hedgings that are more acute in summer and obviously moving, so the power price effect that. So short answer is yes. And the only other change to it that in know of because obviously we adjusted the interest payments a little down to reflect partially -- or impact some of the refinancing we did and we have a slight uptick in not really working capital but changes in other assets and liabilities over the course of the year, some of that has to do with the asbestos settlement. So that\u2019s the other reason for a little bit of the changes between the lines EBITDA and adjusted cash from operations. But obviously we don\u2019t expect that to have an impact on the bottom-line on free cash flow before growth and we do expect the collateral to return and we're in line with our year\u2019s expectations on cash flow.","Greg Gordon ","And Mauricio when I look at Slide 15 and the realized cost savings, margin, working capital improvements et cetera on the slow card, you didn\u2019t have anything in the script with regard to your feelings on being able to hit those targets but should we assume that to be full on track to hit those targets in \u201819 and \u201820?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, absolutely, I -- we have something on the priorities but I\u2019m very comfortable hitting our cost savings targets by the end of the year, margins enhancement this year and next year. So everything is on track.","Greg Gordon ","And then when we talk about these -- the potential for up to a $124 million turnover reserve guarantee. It's obviously - it\u2019s in the 10-K, it's been in the 10-K but probably still surprises some people. What is going to -- you said that there is a proscribed calculation, is it certainty that you will have to post for $124 million or there is sort of sliding scale of potential payments you have to make inside of range so to speak? And then is it should be our expectation that whatever the remaining cap is net of that obligation that you will allocate on a Q3 call?","Kirk Andrews","It\u2019s Kirk. I think as Mauricio said we will update our plans for our excess capital for you on the third quarter to answer your questions. Yes, as to the 124 million that is the maximum amount that is not necessarily the expectation, it is dependent on the finalization of that calculation but as I indicated once that calculation is made and that payment amount is set which we do expect to happen in the third quarter, the obligation falls away. The one time test is a one-time guarantee and any remaining that is not recourse to NRG. So in short what I would say is we expect to make a payment, which I\u2019d tell you exactly what that payment is except to say it is absolutely limited to the amount of our guarantee which is that $124 million. ","Greg Gordon ","My last question Mauricio sort of a different question along lines of the solar contracts that you\u2019ve entered into the -- fundamentally as you think about managing the business you talk about really what you\u2019re trying to do is manage the spread between your cost of goods sold which is your fleet in your contracts and your revenue line which now has sort of fundamentally matched Retail. Are these -- is this sort of strategy fundamentally reducing your run rate costs of goods sold in the marketplace? And is it one of the reasons why amongst other things you\u2019re confident that your EBITDA and free cash flow profile is sustainable over time? Can you talk about what that does in terms of offsetting people\u2019s concerns that perhaps over time Retail margins might -- if retail revenues come down, if your cost of goods sold stays static and therefore margins would come under pressure. I think what you\u2019re telling us is that you can manage the numerator and the denominator for the time and that\u2019s why you\u2019re confident that you\u2019ve actually perfected the model?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes I mean that\u2019s exactly the goal of the strategy. I mean when we look at our total Generation portfolio our goal is to reduce as you said the cost of goods sold which now becomes our cost of Generation. And I will tell you that we have executed some of these PPAs at very attractive levels compared particularly to the market. I mean we are in the process right now of executing in the market and depending on the location because all of these PPAs are spread out depending on where we have the load. So they have very different pricing. Also the tenure is different. I mean on average it\u2019s ten years but some of them are a little longer than that, some of them are little shorter than that. And the impact of these PPAs will come in full earnings some time in 2021. I can\u2019t give you any more details in terms of where we have entered into these PPAs because obviously we\u2019re still in the market. But what I can tell you just from a order of magnitude, so far we have reduced our -- basically our cost of goods sold which translates into EBITDA, let\u2019s say about 2% of our EBITDA. So I mean that at least gives you some order of magnitude in terms of what to expect. And as you said as we lower our cost of production we have a lot more degrees of freedom in terms of the way we maintain the savings that we have or the cost comparisons that we have that we pass it to our customers to gain market share. ","But then I mean it creates a lot more optionality for us. And just keep in mind that this notion that if wholesale prices will decrease they will decrease our margins, it assumes that we basically will do nothing. We\u2019ll do nothing to change the cost structure and the repositioning of our company. And I have to remind everybody that starting in 2020 we have basically full financial flexibility. We don\u2019t have to wait, one or two or three years. ","Starting in -- even this year we have financial flexibility but it will -- so if you think about our stable platform this year we produced between $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, by the time 2021 we are all seen. I mean we're going to have over $2.5 billion that we can deploy to continue perfecting our platform. So I think it's important to put it in context the position that we have put ourselves in place. We are done with our deleveraging and our strengthening of our balance sheet program. And now we have this full financial flexibility to allocate into perfecting our model and returning capital to shareholders which I think is incredibly important as a stable cash flow business that we have. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Your line is open. ","Angie Storozynski ","So I have only one question. So given what you\u2019ve just said right that you have plenty of levers to react to lower power prices, can you tell us if you can largely or fully mitigate the backwardation and the impact of the backwardation in forward power curves on your EBITDA or free cash flow i.e. there isn't -- basic initiative of your earnings is not similar to the one that we see currently in ERCOT power curves?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, Angie what I can tell you unequivocally is that we have created a platform that is sustainable and predictable. What mean sustainable and predictable is, year-in, year-out we're going to produce the excess cash that we produce today. Now we're going to have this incredible financial flexibility that we have afforded ourselves to have to increment that all. So the value proposition that we have today is to have a stable cash flow business that grows at a 2% to 4% a year with an investment grade balance sheet and significant excess cash to grow the business in an accretive way and to return capital -- meaningful capital to shareholders. We think that combination of those three things will eventually change and we raise the valuation of stock which if I\u2019m not mistaken right now is somewhere in the mid-teens to high-teens free cash flow yield. We don\u2019t believe that business that I describe to you today should be there. And if it gets re-rated closer to where we think should be, then our stock price will be much, much higher than it is today. Obviously, we also appreciate that this is the first year that we are showing the benefits of this platform. 2018 was a good test, we had a very volatile summer. 2019 is very important because it continues to demonstrate that our platform performs and there are a lot of different pricing scenarios. So now it is up to all that, if this continues to happen and we\u2019ve taken care of our balance sheet and we can demonstrate that to our shareholders and to rating agencies then we're on the path to re-rate the stock. ","Angie Storozynski ","And just one last question. I was definitely the one surprised by the Petra Nova mention. Is there any other legacy business that might have any types of cash flow implications like I don\u2019t know, even call it something else to whether there is type of guarantee?","Kirk Andrews","It\u2019s Kirk, no, the two remains are legacies. In addition Agua Caliente that we have obviously minority stake with remainder being owned by clearly formerly yield and the balance with Midwest Generation. That debt is non-recourse top NRG so there are no financial guarantees. This Petra Nova leverage test is a product that\u2019s unique if go through Petra Nova. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your question please. ","Shahriar Pourreza","First just on the IG status. Can you maybe just elaborate a bit further on how the conversations are going with the agencies? And obviously outside of presenting very healthy metrics today, can you just get the agencies to look after philosophical issues about having an IG related IPP, are you still trying to gain confidence on the retail business and as you\u2019re thinking about timing or we think in the back half of 2020?","Kirk Andrews","Shahriar, I\u2019d answer the last part of your question, I think that\u2019s probably the realistic case. Back half of 2020 is probably the early timeline in fact of when we would expect that movement to make. Obviously on an unsecured basis we\u2019re two notches away from the minimum threshold of the investment grade that being triple B minus, that\u2019s not say that\u2019s our aspiration that\u2019s sort of the inflection point between sub-investment grade and investment grade. But I think on that timeline is probably reasonable. Certainly between now and then we need to see at least one notch uptick could be at least then one notch away. And I think in much the same way is that although we\u2019re more frustrated with the reaction in stock pricing, we\u2019ve obviously got to demonstrate that to our equity investors. The mandate still holds on the other side of the equation with the rating agencies. I think delivering the numbers that we\u2019ve now reaffirmed for this year which confirms that notwithstanding the sell off that probably represents some of the prices that happens our ability to do so, we are able to do so. So delivering on that this year continuing to execute. ","And the background as I\u2019ve mentioned you this before we\u2019ve been very pleased with the level of dialogue with rating agencies. I think they\u2019ve dug in to understand to their credit Retail business in particular a lot more. So I think the progression of the dialogue and their perspectives on Retail and understanding how we operate the model and how Retail truly operates in tandem with Generation has been constructive and productive. ","And it\u2019s up to us to continue to execute which we have confidence to do so. But it will take probably that amount of time in order to get those two notches behind us on our way to the base. ","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just lastly on this token dividend, you guys still keep it. At what point do you make a decision to either grow it or remove it completely?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes, well, when you think about capital allocation because I mean that\u2019s really -- I think your question Shahriar how we think about capital allocation going forward and what I will tell you is that we have no changes neither on our philosophy on the principal that we have provided to all of you. I think the only thing that has changed is the fact that we have completed one of our priorities which is achieve an investment grade balance sheet. That\u2019s basically not out of the way. What that means is that we have all the excess cash that we will generate it will be to perfect our model or return capital to shareholders. Like I said Shahriar, I do believe that a business that is stable and growing a lot of excess cash needs to provide -- needs to return a meaningful part of that to the shareholders. Today that\u2019s one of the most efficient ways to do is through share buybacks. I think we speak 250 million incremental share buyback that we announced today, to take advantage of what I believe is an undervaluation of our stock without any changes to the fundamental drivers -- value drivers of our business. Now as we go into 2020, obviously, we're going to evaluate all the other different options, I don\u2019t know what the market is going to -- where it\u2019s going to be at the end of the year, I\u2019m going to evaluate all that. What I will tell you is that our goal is to re-rate the stock to its fundamental value and we're going to evaluate all options that we have available to us to ensure that we do that. ","Shahriar Pourreza","And just Mauricio one last on capital allocation. I just want to confirm because obviously certain retailers have hit the block right now that your -- from a capital allocation standpoint you are sort of out of the market and you're not looking at further inorganic retail acquisitions?","Mauricio Gutierrez","That we are out of the market? ","Shahriar Pourreza","Right, so are you looking at additional retail acquisitions similar to Stream or you\u2019re sort of out of the market?","Mauricio Gutierrez","I mean I don\u2019t comment on M&A either specific processes or anything. What I will tell you is that, when I think about inorganic growth I will always adhere to the capital allocation principle that we have outlined for all of you. We have to meet the threshold -- the financial threshold that we have and they have to be a better investment than investing in our own stock. I have said before that while we have rebalanced our portfolio pretty good the past couple of years, we can still perfect that platform. In Texas our Retail is a little bit bigger than our Generation and in the East our Generation than bigger than our Retail. ","So we're executing on our capital-light strategy in Texas to rebalance our portfolio. We acquired Stream to rebalance our Retail and we're going to continue to look at all the opportunities. I mean that is the -- I guess the benefit that we have afforded ourselves with the financial flexibility that we have today. We can be opportunistic about when to do it. But obviously where the stock price is today, the bar is a little bit higher than it was not too long ago when our stock price was started to reflect the fundamental value of our business. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your question please. ","Praful Mehta ","Thanks again for all the color on the business model, it was very helpful. I guess just following up a little bit on that. Slide 20, you have the wholesale gross margins which clearly have come down a little bit from Q1 given the drop in the power prices. But I\u2019m assuming as you talked about in your business model points that some of this drop in the wholesale gross margin will be made up for on the Retail side in 2020. Is that a fair way to think about how we should look at Slide 20 today? ","Mauricio Gutierrez","Yes I think the way you need to think about ERCOT is an integrated model. So while we only give you one side of leg, the Generation, we haven\u2019t provided you the Retail sensitivity to it. And to be candid, I mean that\u2019s being up -- is on -- is up to us to improve our disclosures. ","What I think about our business? I don\u2019t think about it as two completely separate businesses, one Generation, one Retail. Our disclosures have been really good on Generation. I think where we need to do our better job is to enhance our disclosures to capture the integration of our business because when I think about how do we manage our business, I think about it as an integrated business where the gross margin, the combined gross margin is what matters. I care less about where it comes from, whether it\u2019s Generation or Retail, I care about delivering the total gross margin year-in and year-out. ","I mean various other puts and takes. I mean in the Northeast you have capacity a little bit lower and -- but that\u2019s being offset by margin enhancement and then we have the impact of Stream. I mean my point here is, you cannot look at our business just on a static basis, with the amount of the financial flexibility we have to improve it. It\u2019s like saying that we\u2019re not going to do anything but we have all this excess cash available to deploy in the most meaningful way that creates value for our shareholders. ","So yes, I'm very comfortable with our platform in 2020 and beyond. And as I said our goal is to provide stable earnings, stable excess cash with a modest growth. That\u2019s our goal. ","Praful Mehta ","Yes, now that additional disclosure on the Retail side would be super helpful to kind of complement the points you made on the business model. I guess moving on to the PPA side for solar, I guess it\u2019s a little different from your perspective because you obviously have the option to sign more solar PPAs at pretty low prices which is helpful for your Retail. But then you\u2019re bringing in a lot more Generation at pretty low pricing but you\u2019re kind of drawing more solar into the market. How do you balance that, does it a benefit from your perspective as you said to have volatility so just bringing in a lot of solar generation by offering them PPAs may not be the right solution from a holistic business perspective?","Mauricio Gutierrez","Well, I -- you may say it may not be, I think it is. And the reason why is -- we have a very valuable franchise in ERCOT. And we want to make sure that the competitive market continues to work and work well in the state. We need so much capacity to even maintain this current reserve margin. It really doesn\u2019t matter if we bring 10 or 15 gigawatts of renewables. You\u2019re going to continue to have tight reserve margins, which is not going to affect the scarcity conditions in the system. I mean all this is not going to be affected if you basically keep your reserve margin at 8%, 9%. That other is administratively set. So I actually think that if the competitive market works well, it\u2019s going to provide a right price signal and the cheapest technology is the one that is going to get built, the cheapest technology to meet the needs of the system. And if that happens whether it\u2019s solar wind or conventional with high ramping capacity, we think that that\u2019s going to require some time. And that\u2019s why I say for the foreseeable future ERCOT, I expect really tight conditions with strong prices and tremendous amount of volatility, Chris, is there anything that you want to add?","Chris Moser","No, I was just going to point out that we\u2019ve seen ORDC has really been doing its job since the commission tweaked it earlier this year, it\u2019s been a noticeable difference in pricing, whether it was like a $4.50 adder for this mild July that we had which compares to like a $5 adder, last year when July was smoking hot. Over the last couple of days where we\u2019ve seen $100 to $200 tagged on in these hot days of August, ORDC just like Mauricio said, just doesn't need costly marginal cost units -- unit to impact, it\u2019s administratively set. And to the extent that you could build almost 20 gigs of renewables and that you need to do that just to stay flat in terms of reserve margin, yes, I\u2019m not too worried about it. And don\u2019t forget that there is another quarter turn of ORDC coming next March too, so I think we should be okay for a while.","Praful Mehta ","All great points. And then just finally clearly you guys are executing on the business model and the market I agree needs time to understand and fully see the execution off the business model. But if at some point you don't see the stock price perform and you're hearing and you're still having the same conversation, is there a point when you look at go private as a transaction that\u2019s possible or is that something that's not on the table at this point? ","Mauricio Gutierrez","I am sorry, the going private? ","Kirk Andrews","The market doesn\u2019t. ","Mauricio Gutierrez","I mean right now our focus is on executing that strategy that we have. As I already mentioned to you Praful I mean we believe that this is a very compelling value proposition. I also recognize that this is a new business model for the competitive power sector. I rather no longer refer us as IPP but as an IPC we're truly now an integrated power company. And so to the extent that we continue to demonstrate the viability and the stability of this platform, not just to our shareholders but also to rating agencies. I think that there is an opportunity to re-rate the stock. But obviously if that doesn\u2019t happen, once we feel that we kind of exhausted all our efforts to demonstrate the stability of our business, then we will explore all options to maximize the value of our shareholders. So I mean that\u2019s something we just have to do. But I don\u2019t think that time yet, I mean we only have provided -- we\u2019ve proven this technology for two years, 2018 very successfully, 2019 we're on track to deliver very successfully. So recognizing that I think we need to give ourselves some time and we need to give our shareholders and the rating agencies some time to digest this strategic shift. And when we feel that we have given enough time and the market is not responding which I\u2019m still hopeful that it will and I\u2019m convinced that it will because we have a very strong value proposition, then we will evaluate something else. But right now all our focus, a 100% our focus is on executing this strategy. ","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to the CEO of NRG Energy, Inc.
