My name is Shelley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Results Call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","James Armstrong","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings call. We issued our press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the right side of the application you\u2019re using to view this webcast.","With me on today\u2019s call are WestRock\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; our Chief Financial Officer, Ward Dickson; the President of Corrugated Packaging, Jeff Chalovich; as well as our President of Consumer Packaging, Bob Feeser. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer session.","During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates, and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.","Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. As mentioned previously, the slide presentation is available on our website.","With that said, I\u2019ll turn it over to you, Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thank you, James. Good morning. thanks for joining our call today. WestRock had another solid quarter with adjusted segment EBITDA $733 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.83. The WestRock team effectively and efficiently implemented our integration plans for KapStone while addressing the challenges due to the substantial impact of Hurricane Michael on our Panama City mill.","We\u2019re performing well on a challenging environment. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on the capacity announcements in North America and the global containerboard markets. We have ample opportunities to advance our strategy, take the steps needed to continue to improve our business. We\u2019re making great progress on the integration of KapStone and we\u2019re beginning to capture the $200 million of KapStone synergy and performance improvement opportunities. KapStone was accretive by approximately $0.04 and adjusted earnings per share for the two months we owned it during the quarter.","Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.89 times. We\u2019re focused on returning our balance sheet to a 2.25 times to 2.50 times targeted leverage ratio, and we bought back $44 million of stock during the quarter. WestRock team continues to successfully execute our differentiated strategy and we\u2019re collaborating with our customers to help them win in the marketplace. We\u2019re well positioned to deliver outstanding value to our customers and our stockholders.","Before turning to our segment results, I\u2019m going to point out two changes that we made to our financial disclosure during the quarter. First, we changed how we conduct our recycling operations to a procurement model. What this means is that no recycling sales are recorded and that the margin from our recycling operations reduces the cost of goods sold. Second, we moved our merchandising displays business from the Consumer Packaging segment to the Corrugated Packaging segment. We did this in recognition of the increasing overlap of the manufacturing capabilities in our display plants and our box plants. We\u2019ve shown the impact of these changes in the appendix of our presentation.","Our sales in the quarter were $4.3 billion. This was 14.5% higher than last year, and this excludes the impact of recycling sales during the prior year period. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased by $67 million or 9.8%. This was despite the last production and sales resulting from the severe damage that Hurricane Michael cause to our Panama City mill. Adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.04 to $0.83 per share due to higher depreciation and amortization and higher interest cost that more than offset the increase in EBITDA.","Let\u2019s turn to costs in the quarter. Costs were a stronger headwind than we anticipated. Natural gas prices spiked to more than $4.50 per MMBTU. Wood prices, especially hardwood prices have been elevated as the wood baskets we draw from remain excessively wet. Somewhat offsetting the impact of higher natural gas and wood fiber, the impact of Hurricane Michael on our Panama City mill was $14 million favorable to our guidance. This is the testament to the tenacity of our team.","The Corrugated Packaging segment sales for the first fiscal quarter were $2.7 billion. This was an increase of 24% over the last year. The increase is due to the KapStone acquisition and improved price and mix. Our North American corrugated adjusted EBITDA margins were 21% as the KapStone acquisition, excluding Victory was essentially neutral to our overall adjusted EBITDA margins. And our 21% margins were even stronger than you might think when you consider that the losses incurred at our Panama City mill reduced our North American corrugated margins by 130 basis points in the quarter.","In our first fiscal quarter, we achieved record box shipments, which were up 13.5% year-over-year. Our legacy WestRock North American corrugated box shipments increased 3.1% year-over-year on a per day basis, and this was also a record. We\u2019ve had a streak of 20 consecutive months of higher growth in the industry average.","Over this time period, our legacy WestRock cumulative shipments have increased by 5.3% in contrast to the industry\u2019s growth excluding WestRock of 1.3%. If you convert those to tons, this incremental growth over the industry average is equivalent to about 200,000 pounds of consumption. This performance has been enabled by our differentiated strategy, product offering and approach to customers.","Okay. Let\u2019s talk about how our machinery solutions contribute to our differentiated strategy. The number of machines we\u2019ve installed as grown from 2,100 to 2,500 over the past 20 months. Machinery supports customers consuming more than 1.5 million tons or approximately one out of every four of our six million tons consumed annually for the production of boxes. The six million tons includes KapStone. And KapStone and Victory provide an expanded set of customers that can take advantage for our differentiated product and service offerings.","In January, our North American corrugated box demand continues to be strong with legacy WestRock box shipments organically growing at higher than 4% year-over-year with most of the month complete. While our box volumes increased in the first quarter, saw lower container board volumes and domestic and export markets. Export prices were materially higher than the prior year quarter, but they were lower than the September quarter.","Okay. I\u2019m going to take a moment now and discuss our inventory levels and to provide context, prior to the completion of the acquisition of KapStone, we had no visibility into how KapStone operated their mill system and this includes their approach to establishing their inventory levels.","So the quarter progressed, our mills ran well, we met our customers demand in all three of our channels, and we gained visibility into our combined system supply and demand. As the quarter progressed, it became apparent we were carrying more inventory than we needed. And in fact, at the end of December, we\u2019re holding approximately 100,000 tons of excess inventory.","So in this quarter, the current quarter we\u2019re reducing our inventories to normal levels, we\u2019re matching our production to our customers demand. In January, we initiated our inventory reduction with 35,000 tons of production slowbacks. The impact of this is incorporated into our guidance that Ward will discuss in a few minutes.","Let\u2019s talk in more detail about Panama City. And I\u2019m pleased to report Panama City returned to full production of containerboard during November. However, as we\u2019ve reported the damage has been severe, we don\u2019t expect the mill to return to full pulp production until the end of the June quarter.","And I\u2019m thanking all of our employees\u2019 contracts \u2013 contractors and their families throughout WestRock for your hard work and support recovering so quickly from this natural disaster, it\u2019s been incredible. Now, to the financial impact, Hurricanes Florence and Michael impacted the quarter by $31 million or $0.09 of adjusted earnings per share. We expect to recoup a significant amount of these losses through insurance reimbursements in the coming quarters net of the $15 million deductible. Our Florence, South Carolina paper machine project is on schedule and on budget. We expect to receive our first equipment deliveries next month and we continue to expect the project to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2020.","Now onto Brazil. The Brazil team delivered outstanding results with adjusted segment EBITDA margins 27.7%. Our new world-class Porto Feliz box plant is running and we made our first box from our newly-installed flexo folder gluer last week. Our previous announced project of the Tres Barras mill is well underway. And as a reminder, we expect that when the box plant and mill projects are complete, they will increase Brazil\u2019s adjusted EBITDA by more than 125% and margins EBITDA margins to over 30%.","Turning to KapStone. We\u2019ve already made significant progress on integrating the KapStone operations into our North American Corrugated Packaging business. The mills and box plants had been successfully rolled into our management and operating business structures and the installation of common systems and processes is under why. We\u2019ve had some quick ones by leveraging the size and scale of WestRock\u2019s purchasing spend and our commercial teams are making good progress.","At the end of December, we\u2019ve achieved a $30 million run rate of synergies and performance improvements. And we\u2019ve been able to spend more time in the mills and box plants and we\u2019ve confirmed that the opportunities for productivity improvements that we anticipated at the time of the \u2013 and we announced the KapStone acquisition are there. We have proven capabilities to optimize the cost structure and operations of the large mills as we\u2019ve done with Smurfit-Stone, Tacoma and the SP Fiber mills.","We\u2019re seeing the benefits of our expanded geographic footprint and enhanced product offering. Victory Packaging has created opportunities for us to use their warehouse space to serve legacy WestRock customers. We expect to integrate more than 60,000 tons of annual box production to our Victory locations by the end of March. And we continue to expect to achieve $200 million, and synergies and performance improvements by the end of fiscal 2021.","In our Consumer Packaging segment. Our sales of $1.6 billion represented an increase of 1% over the last year. Our results reflect the flow through of previously published price increases and productivity improvements that were offset by input costs and wage inflation. We\u2019ve seen demand growth in many end markets. These include food service, liquid packaging, beverage, and retail food. Gains in these end markets are tempered by the ongoing secular declines of tobacco and media.","Demand across our paperboard substrates is strong. CNK is tight. CRB demand remains good and SPS volumes are steady. Our paperboard backlogs were strong in the quarter. They\u2019re currently between four weeks and seven weeks. We\u2019re implementing the previously published price increases across each of our consumer paper grades in accordance with our contract terms. And as a reminder, Pulp & Paper Week published price increases the fact approximately half of our business with the remaining business based on mechanisms not directly tied to these indices.","Adjusted segment EBITDA in the quarter was $216 million. Adjusted segment EBITDA was down $19 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher inflation and lower volumes that were partially offset by favorable price, mix, and productivity. We will install a new curtain coder at our Mahrt mill during March. And in April, we\u2019ll upgrade one of our three paper machines at Covington. And then in June, we\u2019ll replace the head box at our Demopolismill.","These three projects have required comprehensive supply chain planning, quitting building inventory to support our customers and advance of the outages. The projects will moderate earnings in the second and third fiscal quarters. Once these projects are implemented, we\u2019ll operate the consumer mill system that will be lower cost, provide even a higher quality paper for our customers.","Sales in our beverage business grew by nearly 10% year-over-year. Our beverage machinery offerings in important part of our differentiated solutions that helps our customers grow their sales and reduce their costs. Our total installed base of approximately 1000 machines supports about 330,000 tons of carton sales annually or 70% of our total beverage carton sales.","Many of our customers are interested in reducing or replacing their plastic packaging with paper based packaging. We\u2019ve implemented solutions in the food service and retail food markets to replace plastic containers with paperboard cartons and trays. We\u2019ve sold machine solutions into the beverage market to replace printed film multipacks with paperboard. WestRock\u2019s uniquely positioned to help our customers shift to more sustainable packaging with our diverse product and capability offerings.","Although we report in two segments, our strategies focused on serving our customers with our broad portfolio of paper packaging, merchandising machinery and supply chain solutions. We have more than 130 customers that buy more than $1 million from each of our segments. This accounts for approximately $60 billion or a little bit over 30% of our annual sales. The power of our broad portfolio enables us to combine WestRock\u2019s products and services. Why does that create unique winning solutions in the marketplace, ones that our customers value and ones that create value for our stockholders.","That completes my comments on the quarter. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ward.","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. Turning to slide 8. We outline our key assumptions for our fiscal second quarter 2019 guidance. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA in the second quarter to be between $700 million and $735 million as compared to $733 million in our first fiscal quarter and $649 million last year.","Walking through the sequential bridge, favorable pricing in slightly higher volume in our Consumer segment will be partially offset by higher scheduled maintenance downtime or a net increase of $10 million to $15 million. Pricing is higher due to the continued flow through of previously published price increases. Continuing down the sequential bridge, we expect the impact of a full quarter of KapStone\u2019s results to contribute approximately $45 million to $50 million in additional adjusted segment EBITDA.","In our Corrugated segment, we expect adjusted segment EBITDA to be negatively impacted by $20 million to $45 million, due primarily to mill maintenance downtime and the actions that we are taking to reduce our inventory. Volumes across all three sales channels are expected to be stable. We expect sequential inflation for the entire company of approximately $45 million, mainly due to annual salary and benefit cost increases and the restarted payroll related taxes.","Other input costs are moderately higher, primarily increasing virgin fiber costs as a result of the wet weather. This input cost inflation should be partially offset by expected lower natural gas prices. We expect increased acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.08 per share. In addition, interest expense will also be sequentially higher to account for a full quarter of KapStone ownership and higher interest rates, impacting the quarter by approximately $0.10 a share.","We expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 24.5% versus the adjusted 23.3% rate reported in the fiscal first quarter. Considering our guidance for the second quarter, we now forecasts fiscal year 2019 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $3.5 billion, a slight reduction from our previous guidance.","As our full-year guidance would suggest the second half of the year will likely be much better than the first for multiple reasons. Our scheduled mill and maintenance outages across our system occurred during fiscal first through third quarters, and we have no scheduled outages in the fourth quarter. We will have rebalanced our inventory levels across our containerboard system.","Our Panama City mills expected to be fully operational by the end of June and should no longer have a negative impact on earnings. We expect to realize the insurance recovery from lost profits in the second half of the year, which will run through our P&L. We will reach full realization of the previously published PPW price increases across the consumer paperboard grades in the second half of the fiscal year.","We will realize increased synergies from the optimization of the KapStone containerboard mill and box plant system. We expect that volumes in the back half of the year will be seasonally stronger coupled with seasonally lower wood and energy costs. We have adjusted our capital expenditure estimate for fiscal 2019 from $1.5 billion to $1.4 billion. With the completion of many of our strategic capital projects in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, we will transition to our long-term capital expenditure run rate of $1 billion in fiscal 2021.","We have some additional full-year assumptions in the appendix and I will point out a few changes. We are completing our KapStone purchase price allocation and our estimate for total company depreciation and amortization is estimated to be approximately $1.5 billion for the fiscal year, which is that at the low end of our previous guidance range.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve for some closing comments. Steve?","Steve Voorhees","thanks, Ward. I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with our customers and implementing our differentiated strategy and progress we\u2019re making to deploy capital to improve our cost structure and capabilities. We\u2019re doing all of this while paying a dividend that provides a 4.4% yield and cash flows that are providing us a path to return to our target leverage ratio. We\u2019re motivated by the many opportunities in front of us. We\u2019re excited by the future and we\u2019re engaged and proactively managing our challenges. We\u2019re clear on what we need to accomplish to deliver value for our customers and our stockholders.","Now that concludes my prepared remarks. James, we\u2019re ready for Q&A.","James Armstrong","thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience to give everybody a chance to ask a question, please limit your question to one with a follow-up as needed. We\u2019ll get to as many as time allows. Operator, can we please take our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is now open.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","With regards to the inventory reduction effort, you talked about, I think the 100,000 tons of excess inventories and taking down 35,000 tons in January in slowbacks. So, just to be clear, will you lower another 65,000 tons in the course of the quarter or could that carry through to next quarter? Just trying to understand the timing.","Jeff Chalovich","Hey Anthony, it\u2019s Jeff. Good morning. So as Steve mentioned, we have a large mill outage in the quarter, so we have over 80,000 tons in maintenance downtime and we\u2019ve taken the 35. We won\u2019t talk about anything we do in the future as it relates to other downtime. We will look at our inventories on the floor. There\u2019s a finite amount of space in our box plants and warehouses that will fill, and we\u2019ll continue to match our production to our customers\u2019 demands across all of our channels. So I\u2019ll say that.","Anthony Pettinari","Got it, got it. And then just on the medium price decline that was published in Pulp & Paper Week, is it possible to say what earnings impact that is if any?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. Still Jeff, it\u2019s de minimis in our world, very small under $5 million to the whole system. Very few box contracts are tied to it and with our exposure in our containerboard; it\u2019s not that much on the outside for our medium, so very small.","Anthony Pettinari","Great. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","George Staphos","Hi. Thank you very much. Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Two questions from me, nearer term, you mentioned that box lines I think are trending nicely into the fiscal second quarter. I think you mentioned up 4%, correct me if I\u2019m wrong there. Can you provide some incremental disclosure in terms of exit rates on, say export volumes, what you\u2019re seeing in third-party domestic volumes, recognizing how to take downtime, but what you\u2019re seeing in terms of shipments there. Then on the other hand, Steve, if we\u2019re having this conversation a year from now and you look back at what made for a more successful year or not, what is the one thing that you\u2019ve got to manage to here? Is it supply relative to demand? Is it integrating KapStone, because the industry is outside of kind of an interesting point right now, both within containerboard and the boxboard markets in terms of supply demand? Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","Would you take the first time Jeff? And then I\u2019ll respond.","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, George.","George Staphos","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Chalovich","I\u2019ll cover the exit rates in what we\u2019re seeing. So box remains strong. We\u2019re up over 4% and we see our backlogs continuing and we\u2019ve been that way through the quarter and into this quarter. Ward mentioned earlier sequentially flat we\u2019re seeing in our containerboard markets. And I\u2019d say that for our craft markets, both in export and domestic. What I would say is, what we\u2019ve \u2013 what we\u2019ve noticed in our backlogs, our orders are in much earlier coming into the end of January for February. We\u2019re coming out of the first quarter. I would say that we weren\u2019t as booked as early in our containerboard export and domestic, and going into the month, we\u2019re well above, where we had seen the last few months in all of our backlogs with our containerboard.","Steve Voorhees","George, you gave me one thing and I think that may be difficult to isolate one time. But I think for us, I think it\u2019s really clear. I think we have to execute on the plans that we have. We\u2019ve got tremendous opportunities internally. I think we\u2019ve got tremendous opportunities with our customers. We\u2019ve got tremendous opportunities to improve productivity. And so we just \u2013 like one year from now, I think the key thing for us is executing on the plans that we have in place.","George Staphos","Okay, I\u2019ll turn it over. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Maguire","Hey, good morning everyone.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning.","Brian Maguire","Just a question on again, back to the strong January and the fourth \u2013 first quarter shipment trends. I\u2019m just wondering, surprisingly strong relative to, I think expectations and kind of where some of the Fibre Box Association numbers were in November, the last ones we had. I\u2019m just wondering if you comment \u2013 give any comments on what you think is driving that strength or maybe any end markets, where you\u2019re seeing a particular uptick in demand. And that\u2019s just sort of related to that, Pulp & Paper Week spoke of some discounts, being made available in the linerboard market. Can you provide any color on why you think that might be the case given these strong shipment numbers you\u2019re talking about?","Jeff Chalovich","Hey Brian, it\u2019s Jeff. let me start with the box shipments and why we think we continue to grow this business. First, we\u2019re meeting our customers\u2019 critical challenges in the market. So, we\u2019re delivering no fill basics, which starts with perfect quality and on-time delivery. And then secondly, our value proposition is helping our customers lower their total cost, increase their sales, minimize their risk, and also helping them maximize their environmental footprint. We\u2019re delivering on those four pillars and our value proposition. We continue to differentiate with our machine sales, our enterprise sales; we can bring a lot to the table for our customers. So, we continue to execute well across the system. In our markets that we continually see that e-commerce continues to be favorable for us. our bakery snack business is favorable, distribution, our food process, pizza and everything that goes along with that across our systems have been favorable and we also have positive in our retail and consumer.","So, across the board, we continue to see opportunities to grow the business organically. We continue to deliver on those no fill basics, which has helped us stay strong. On the linerboard, so, it\u2019s interesting in the pricing, we\u2019ve seen some pressures pulp and paper published on medium and there was some pressure. We\u2019re seeing some spot pressure on medium in the markets, but we have not seen the same in our linerboard. So, our linerboard and box pricing, we haven\u2019t seen the same pressures. It\u2019s been predominantly around medium in some of our markets.","Brian Maguire","Okay. I appreciate that. And this is a follow-up to Ward, just on the $100 million cut to the CapEx, just wondering to what\u2019s driving that in this, you might have mentioned in our prepared remarks, but I might have missed that. Is that just being deferred out into 2020? I\u2019m thinking you could comment around 2021 being $1 billion or was that just the base before the strategic projects? Thanks.","Ward Dickson","Right. So embedded in our $1.4 million of CapEx this year, our original guidance was $1.5 billion. We simply took action to respond to the lower operating cash flow from the EBITDA reduction and we have deferred CapEx. Embedded in that target this year, we will invest approximately $500 million across the strategic capital projects that amount should drop in half to about $250 million next year. So when \u2013 after we complete those projects, as we exit FY 2020, I anticipate that FY 2021 will return to our long-term ongoing CapEx investment level of $1 billion of which 50% of that $1 billion is M&R and 50% of it is discretionary return-generating capital.","Brian Maguire","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Good morning, Steve. Jeff, just a quick question on the \u2013 following up on the box shipments for a minute. The 3.1% by our math includes about two points of acquisition volumes from Plymouth Packaging. Is that correct? Or can you talk to us about what the underlying organic volume growth rate is there?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. Hi, Scott. Now, recall Box on Demand was January 5. So it\u2019s a clean, it\u2019s organic and it\u2019s \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be two points Box on Demand and volume is small in our world for shipments. But they \u2013 we had those as January 5 last year. So, it\u2019s clean, it\u2019s organic growth.","Scott Gaffner","Okay, perfect. That\u2019s a strong number. Can you talk a little bit about how that volume growth trended through the quarter, because for you guys actually, it seems like, after October maybe picked up a little bit in November and December?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. October was just under 2% roughly. November, we were roughly 2.5% and then we were up almost 6% in December.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Ward.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning.","Ward Dickson","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","Hey, Jeff. I wondered if you can just talk about any shifts you\u2019re seeing kind of among your e-commerce customers in terms of the strategy or the types of packaging they use. One of your competitors was dancing a jig on YouTube a couple of weeks ago and that\u2019s a competitor that I think produces more lightweight containerboard uses more mixed way. So I just \u2013 I wonder if customers are shifting what they spec or what they require?","Jeff Chalovich","Mark, good morning. I just see the jig. So, in broad sense from our customer base, they\u2019re continuing to look for opportunities to drive our costs. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve been successful. We can do that in a lot of areas across our system and the enterprise. And then in our containerboard system, we are working with customers to reduce fiber, to optimize the packaging size. So the Box on Demand in our machine platform was giving us a tremendous opportunity to optimize the size and head space in packaging. And that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s going to continue. And that\u2019s really been a trend in the business whether that\u2019s e-commerce beverage, remember trays had 3.5 inch step, then they went to 3 inch, 2.5 inch and they went to wrap.","So, it\u2019s going to continue to look at how do you optimize package? How do you take waste out of the system? It\u2019s not a change that I would say is a surprise and we were well positioned with KapStone and with our mill system as we look at optimizing rates to really help our customers meet their strength requirements and lightweights, where they need to. And then through our machine platforms, through Box on Demand and our entire enterprise. We\u2019re really well positioned to meet any changing demand and the current status in the markets.","Mark Wilde","Yes. And Jeff, are you guys using mixed waste or looking at ways to use more mixed waste, because it seems like not only the guy, who did the jig, but also some of the new projects that are coming on are being engineered that I think, they use more mixed waste.","Jeff Chalovich","We\u2019re \u2013 well, I\u2019ll put it this way; we\u2019re using it as much as we can with the system that we have. So, we\u2019ve gone through what we believe is maximum right now on our system and we are using as much as we possibly can.","Mark Wilde","All right. The last question I had just \u2013 on the capacity side, KapStone had not been running that a little medium mill at Cowpens fully over the last couple of years and I just \u2013 I\u2019d like to get your thoughts on how you\u2019re managing that asset, because it seemed like it was already their swing asset.","Jeff Chalovich","So right now, we\u2019re managing it in the entire system looking for supply chain synergies in the entire system. I think it\u2019s too early to tell. We don\u2019t have everything on our system. Just one of the challenges is their east is really manually scheduled and done. and then the west is on op division, but the systems don\u2019t sync up. So right now, we\u2019re trying to optimize the entire supply chain and put paper, where it makes sense in our box plants to our customers both domestic and export. So, nothing really to report there, Mark, except we\u2019re optimizing our entire supply chain.","Mark Wilde","Sounds good. I\u2019ll turn it over. Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Hi. If this required for Jeff to take dance lessons for the next jig, I suggest that WestRock pay for it.","Jeff Chalovich","Lessons is very good already.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Jeff, apologies for underestimating your talent. I just wanted to ask you a question. I know you guys don\u2019t get into the pricing and so totally understand that. When I look at the guidance, it looks like in essence you\u2019re guiding to obviously down from the consensus for the next quarter on an EBITDA basis, but the second half is higher. You\u2019re looking for something north of $2 billion. And is it fair to say that, is there anything you can help us with, would suggest to me that you\u2019re not expecting any material price change in that guidance up or down. is that roughly fair to expect as you give us that guidance?","Ward Dickson","Hey, chip. this is Ward, let me just walk you through the elements and help you and I\u2019ll answer you the question. So, why is the second half stronger than the first half? And I\u2019m going to just kind of go through a laundry list and it will be included, will be your question. So, we have six months worth of KapStone versus five months in the first half. And we also have a seasonally stronger KapStone in the second half, just like our North American containerboard business. So that contributes a meaningful amount of incremental earnings in the first half versus the second half. Panama City, well Panama City, it was a loss in the first quarter. It\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to generate a loss in the second quarter. We\u2019re going to be fully operational in Q3. We\u2019ll return to profitability and we are anticipating the insurance recoveries for the business interruption claims that we have and we\u2019ve said that those will take place in the second half.","Those two are \u2013 those two items that I just described are very meaningful contributors to the earnings growth in the second half versus the first half. And then we have no maintenance outages in Q4. They\u2019re completing Q3. So, our systems running full both in corrugated and Consumer. So, we generate more productivity in the \u2013 in Q4 and the second half of the year as compared to the first half.","And then the actions that we talked about to rebalance our inventory levels in corrugated, we\u2019re taking those actions in Q2 and we\u2019ve given you the range of its impact on the quarter. And then we\u2019re bad \u2013 we have maintenance \u2013 large maintenance outage in corrugated in Q3, but then we\u2019re running full in Q4. So, we have seasonally higher volumes across many of our businesses. We have initial synergy realization from KapStone across our businesses. We\u2019ve got the full realization of the consumer, PPW published increases where \u2013 as we go through the second half of the year. In corrugated, we talked about our export pricing was down sequentially Q1 versus Q4 and that will carry through end of the year, but that\u2019s embedded into our guidance for the rest of the year.","Chip Dillon","that\u2019s very helpful. And just one quick follow-up, it seemed like from my \u2013 from an outsider perspective that the export market was just going gangbusters. And so some time just after Labor Day, maybe early October, and then it stopped on a dime and at least the fingers I saw were pointing more to China, just not buying Jeff, you mentioned that you saw backlogs, if I heard you right, have recently turned up nicely. any help as to where that\u2019s coming from, is it mostly coming from the Far East or from Asia or is it more broad-based in terms of the export for us?","Ward Dickson","Yes. Sure, Chip. For us, recall that 65% or so of our export is Latin America, 20% Europe and then we have Middle East, Africa and Asia. So, Asia for us is a smaller part, we didn\u2019t see a large drop-off in that area. There was some softening reported in more through the third-party brokers let\u2019s say. So for us, that wasn\u2019t a large part, but \u2013 and from the folks we dealt with in China, Asia, Middle East, there was softening in those markets, reported to us from our customer base. And then our typical Latin America, I think was stable. I\u2019d say it was a bit down, but the backlogs are strong and most of that\u2019s direct customers for us and then Europe was a bit softer as you mentioned coming out of the quarter, the fourth.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.","Ward Dickson","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from one of Mark Connelly from Stephens. Your line is now open.","Mark Connelly","Steve, RockTenn had a pretty good box business. But in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve watched those margins go down and stay down even as the industry seems like it\u2019s getting stronger and we get all these price hikes. Is that business just less attractive than it used to be? And what does it take for WestRock to get better returns and better margins there?","Steve Voorhees","Mark, when you say box business, I think you\u2019re talking about our Consumer business.","Mark Connelly","Yes. And there\u2019s some puts and takes to what you\u2019ve got included. But overall, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 the margins are a lot lower than RockTenn used to deliver.","Steve Voorhees","I haven\u2019t done the comparison of what RockTenn used to do. I think our margins are, they\u2019re not as high as they are in the corrugated business. we\u2019ve got a significant focus on improving our cost structure in quality. And so you\u2019re saying the capital projects that we\u2019re doing are really designed to improve our cost structure over time.","We don\u2019t talk about it, on these calls, but the converting operations we have a similar amount of opportunity and I think the way our business is structured, we have, let\u2019s say our traditional carton business, which I think you called the RockTenn carton business. We also have our beverage business and we have MPS and between the three of those businesses; they\u2019re different with respect to markets. one will be more of the general carton market and on MPS is more called premium packaging. And then beverages focused on the beverage market. We see opportunities to take advantage of the combined manufacturing footprint. And so the way I look at the business mark is the business is attractive. We\u2019ve got a very good position and at very good competitive position. And I think if you go back and look at what we\u2019ve done with the Corrugated business starting in 2011 and we\u2019ve really seen the benefits of that. Now, we\u2019re kind of in a similar position now with our Consumer business. We\u2019re still in the early stages of what\u2019s called a multiple year path to improvement and we set that out at an Investor Day. So, I think the business is good. In fact, it\u2019s better than good, and I think we\u2019ve got a good position on it and we have significant opportunities to improve.","Mark Connelly","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Can you just give us a sense now that you\u2019re not going to report merchandise and display, which that you shifted around, sorry. Can you give us a sense of how that performed and how important that business is to your overall value added strategy?","Ward Dickson","Yes. So if you \u2013 if I look at our fiscal 2018 full-year sales, it\u2019s approximately $650 million in revenue and I\u2019ll let Jeff talk about how it fits inside the system.","Jeff Chalovich","Hey, Mark. Good morning. To the question of what does it do for the system, the merchandise display business, there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 first of all, it\u2019s integrated with the corrugated. So, the board that they\u2019re using is internal for those displays. The \u2013 specifically Wisconsin, some of the Westchester plants, we run a bunch of business in the Chicago BU up through that Wisconsin location. So those accounts are tied pretty closely. When we look at our graphic strategy across the enterprise between our preprint litho label sales and our ability to differentiate is strong. So, we\u2019re putting much more litho-lam through those plants out of the box system into that system. So that\u2019s a synergy also.","Now, when you look at the innovation of that team and how they\u2019re able to meet markets for shelf-ready, retail-ready that we can do both in the box system and in merchandise. It\u2019s really appealing and I think the other piece that we\u2019re working through now is, how do we best look at different tiers or segments of display work to get into some of the \u2013 you might call it the smaller sales, the $5 million to $15 million annually, where we hit in the box business and really we think we can leverage that business to do it. But overall, strong design capability, strong innovation, great enterprise for us. I think they\u2019re in entree into places that a typical box sales rep wouldn\u2019t play. They get to marketing. They get to other people. It\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for the enterprise at large.","Mark Connelly","Super, helpful. Thank you.","Jeff Chalovich","Operator?","Operator","Debbie Jones [Deutsche Bank]. Your line is now open.","Debbie Jones","Hi, good morning. My first question on the Consumer business, I think there are a lot of things to be optimistic about you keep delivering on productivity, price mix looks like it\u2019s moving up. It\u2019s a little clear to and unclear to me how to think about a volume contribution for EBITDA for the full year? Is there either a tipping point here with where this is positive? You\u2019ve talked about the strong backlogs and some of the strength in food service it\u2019s just unclear to me how that\u2019s going to trend throughout the year?","Bob Feeser","Yes. Hi Debbie, it\u2019s Bob. Overall, our volumes are going to be up modestly for the year. Just maybe, let me talk a little bit about the markets overall as we indicated your backlogs are strong in the four to seven-week range overall for the system. And just what we\u2019re seeing by grade CMK is tight and we\u2019re seeing good underlying growth in food and beverage, some of that being driven by plastics replacements in the opportunities that we see there. CRB is also strong. We\u2019ve seen some return to growth in the center of the store, which is very welcome.","And then SBS, I would describe that is steady overall, we\u2019re seeing good demand. I think as you know, SBS is our most global substrate, where we compete internationally in a number of end markets. And where we see growth there is in food service, liquid packaging, healthcare, and I would say stable retail food. And what tempers our volumes overall is the secular decline that we continue to see in both tobacco and media and commercial print. So overall described, the volume outlook is being modestly up. Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Gabe Hajde","Good morning gentlemen. Curious if Jeff, maybe you can talk a little bit about demand patterns, and what you\u2019re seeing down in Brazil in the Corrugated business?","Jeff Chalovich","I can talk generally to their business, their\u2013 that business has continued to operate and outgrow the market. I think there are markets right now are fairly stable and as we build our new Porto Feliz box plant. They\u2019re looking to expand, move the Valinhos plant and looking to expand. So, their business continues to perform extremely well and to grow year-over-year.","Steve Voorhees","I think just a status or box volumes were up year-over-year. I think the \u2013 what\u2019s the new President there? I\u2019m looking pretty optimistic about the future of Brazil from the economic standpoint. And I think we\u2019re really happy we\u2019re there. We\u2019ve got a terrific business and we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019re investing in the business and I think the political environment there is positive to where I think will be a tailwind for us overtime, whereas over the past few years, I feel like the economy has been more of a headwind.","Gabe Hajde","Thank you. Steve. Maybe Ward for you, any thoughts on the OCC market or can you update us in terms of what you\u2019re seeing sort of in a real-time basis? It sounds like import permits were issued a little bit quicker than folks were expecting. But maybe, the Chinese are holding off on putting in orders until after the Lunar New Year, I don\u2019t know. And then what\u2019s embedded in guidance.","Ward Dickson","Yes. I\u2019ll talk about what\u2019s on the guidance and I\u2019ll let Jeff comment on the overall market. So, when we gave guidance for the full year back in November. We said that we saw prices going down on the average of about $5 a ton for the full year with some increase embedded in the second half of the year. So, our current forecast for Q2 is relatively stable, see pricing with Q1. And then we have a $10 increase sequentially from Q2 to Q3 and another $5 from Q3 to Q4. So, our overall assumptions are very consistent with what we talked about when we set the original full-year guidance. I\u2019ll let Jeff talk about the markets.","Jeff Chalovich","Yes. To your earlier point, we did see more permits; however, typically, before the Lunar New Year, orders are placed, so that they hit sure, right after we hadn\u2019t seen that in our recycling business. And those permits are really going through the majors in China. We expect there to be some uptick, but again, we\u2019re not seeing a large influx in our recycling business to ship more OCC to China.","Gabe Hajde","Understood. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from Davidson. Your line is now open.","Steve Chercover","Thanks. Good morning everyone. We were a little disappointed in the Consumer Packaging numbers, I mean it\u2019s hard to see how sales were almost flat and the EBITDA was down about $1 and percentage terms. So, can you recover those margins? Is that just a function of the Pulp & Paper Week price increases flowing through or what other initiatives do you have there?","Bob Feeser","Yes, Steve, it\u2019s Bob? Let me talk just a little bit about the quarter overall. As we indicated, we had a significant inflation in the quarter. So, it definitely impacted our results for the quarter. Much of that was in wood, which was in the northeast and impacted our Covington mill in particular. But as we look at our margin outlook overall, we would expect the full year to be at over 15% and our margins are going to be tempered this year as we pointed out that we\u2019re making large capital investments both in Mahrt and Covington to improve our margins. And then post those investments, we would expect that our margins will be above 16%. And as we talked about, we think there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to improve from there, particularly as we look at opportunities for further investments in our converting network to further optimize that.","Steve Chercover","Okay. Thanks, Bob. But actually I\u2019ll just stick with you. So if I understood the display business is a $650 million revenue item, are the margins like the EBITDA margins similar like mid-teens that we should receive migrate over to industrial?","Bob Feeser","No. they\u2019re more like converting margins. So, and again that was an approximate amount of revenue for the full year last year. And the margins, when we talk about the margins in our merchandising display business on its own, it doesn\u2019t reflect the impact to the system of pulling integrated tons through the system.","Steve Chercover","Can you remind us what those converting margins would be like?","Steve Voorhees","There are mid-single and sometimes touching double-digit margins just on the converting side. I think to emphasize what Ward said, you can\u2019t moving those margins over to a corrugated, but the margin has been in Corrugated. So, it\u2019s actually, it\u2019s just a more straightforward way I think for us to report the business. And I think, I just Jeff expanded on the reasons that makes more sense in corrugated for us now.","Steve Chercover","Yes. I appreciate that. And the final one, what inning would you say that the migration of plastic to paper based packaging is in?","Bob Feeser","Steve, it\u2019s Bob again. Hard to describe it as an inning, but I do think it\u2019s early, as you know, it\u2019s an important issue with many of our customers and we\u2019re working with many of them that are interested in reducing their plastic or eliminating it. And just in the last year, we\u2019ve seen tens of millions of dollars of incremental new business directly related to plastics replacement. And I think over the next two to three years, it could meaningfully represent $100 million to $200 million of incremental revenue that we would integrate into our system. But it is certainly a top of mind item for our key customers and we think we\u2019re very well positioned to work with our customers to help them reduce plastic or replace it in a lot of key markets, food service, beverage, food, and then e-commerce.","Steve Chercover","Yes, I agree that. I think you guys will be on the right side of history. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Global. Your line is now open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. Jeff, I think you mentioned that the orders were coming in earlier. And I presume that for February and is that normally indicative of what\u2019s going to be a strong shipment month or is that not a tie or link we should necessarily draw?","Jeff Chalovich","Mark, I\u2019ll speak for us, when we see the orders. So based on our forecast, when we see the orders come in early and if there are 50% or 80% going into the month in our containerboard space, that bodes well for our volumes usually.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. So as it\u2019s specific to containerboard as opposed to corrugated boxes though or am I splitting hairs or not?","Jeff Chalovich","No, you\u2019re not. That\u2019s really for containerboard, because the \u2013 remember the lead times are bit different. So our box lead times can be three to five days. Those are done really at the plant level. So, those are coming into the plan from thousands of customers and then our containerboard business, domestic and export and craft is really booked centrally from a customer service group and our planning group.","So, those are typically, export is usually 30 days to 90 days or bookings, because of the sailings in the ships. And then containerboard, it can be a week or it can be a month, but the earlier those orders are coming in and we have visibility, the better it is, the plan, the system, optimize the trend of low-cost freight and typically that allows us better planning and the volumes are better able to project through the month-end.","Mark Weintraub","Got it. And Ward, you mentioned cutting back from $500 million to $250 million on CapEx for the strategic projects, it\u2019s kind of a $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion number reasonable starting point for expectations on 2020 CapEx.","Ward Dickson","Yes. So just to be clear, we are investing \u2013 we are maintaining our strategic capital projects. And the estimated investment for this year is approximately $500 million. With the completion of the curtain \u2013 curtain coder and the Covington projects, the completion of Porto Feliz as we start to wind down, this is the heavy investment year for Florence, Tres Barras starts to ramp up next year. The natural progression of these projects is that the investment level in FY 2020 will go from $500 million to $250 million associated with those projects.","And then again, our base capital is about approximately a $1 billion. We have the flexibility to flex up or down depending upon the market conditions on our other discretionary projects. But so $1.4 billion this year, the reduction in the strategic capital projects start to roll off next year and then as we move it, we transition to our $1 billion run rate in fiscal 2021.","Mark Weintraub","Got it. Great. Thank you. And then lastly, Bob, I\u2019m assuming success on that CNK\u2019s pending price hike that spreads relative to SBS become actually comes a premium into SBS, would you be expecting customers to shift between grades on that or any color you can provide about how customers think about those two products against each other?","Bob Feeser","Sure. Mark, it\u2019s definitely a change and it\u2019s hard to say whether that new price relationship between the grades is sustainable. but I can tell you that the underlying demand drivers for CUK are very good with plastics replacement in much of our CUK is positioned in applications, where we\u2019ve got very strong performance specifications both in beverage and food. So that actually makes it more difficult for customers to make the switch from CUK to SBS. We\u2019ve had a few examples of that, but it is a very small over time, we could see a little bit more, but in general, the reasons why CUK plays where it plays in those end markets, are because of the specification requirements. So, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll see a lot of switching over time.","Steve Voorhees","Yes. I think just add on to what Bob said, we have had some switching from CRB to SBS when CRB has been extremely tight. And I\u2019ll just reiterate, it\u2019s nice to have the full portfolio of those paper grades, because we can work with our customers, because they need to package their product and fortunately, we\u2019ve got the flexibility to provide our customers with a lot of alternatives to that end.","Mark Weintraub","Thanks so much.","Operator","And your final question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Adam Josephson","Good morning. Thanks everyone for putting me in here. Just Bob, one more on the SBS and CUK topics. So obviously, you\u2019ve just announced the CUK increase, you recently achieved the CRB increase. You haven\u2019t announced anything on SBS, and I think you characterize SBS as stable earlier rather than strong. I think you characterized the other two grades are strong. So, can you just help us with what exactly is going on in SBS relative to CUK and CRB, because there does seem to be a bit of a difference?","Bob Feeser","Yes, Adam. So as you know, again, the SBS market again as our most global substrate. We\u2019re competing with products all around the world and it also goes into many end market applications more than the domestic CRB and then also CUK, which is largely focused on food and beverage. So in SBS, we\u2019re in food service, liquid packaging, healthcare, food markets. And a lot of what we\u2019re seeing in SBS is also being tempered again by secular declines that we see both in a tobacco and commercial print. So overall, I would describe the SBS markets as being flattish. So, those are some of the dynamics I think that are at play between the grades.","Adam Josephson","Thanks Bob. And Jeff, just one more on the box demand situation. So, I know you\u2019ve been significantly outgrowing the industry and kudos to you for having done so. in terms of the industry data, all we have is obviously through November, as you know, there has been a fairly a decent slowdown in industry growth in recent months, at least through November. What would you attribute that to? Is that more the economy? Is it more that the e-commerce bump hasn\u2019t really been there? What would you attribute that trend at least through November too? Thank you very much.","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. I think you have to look at. So in our world, the e-commerce bump was there. I think for the industry or business, I can\u2019t speak to the whole industry. It depends who your customers are? Where you play? We\u2019re very strategic about how we partner with our customers? Where we play? And to help our customers win. So we want to win with winners and hit markets that we think we can grow and that are meaningful. Again, our machinery and differentiation, ability to differentiate through the enterprise approach and through our businesses, helped us continue to grow. And in general, we didn\u2019t see, like I said, we were up each month. We didn\u2019t see an economic slowdown in our business. So, I can\u2019t speak overall for the industry.","Adam Josephson","Thank you, Jeff.","Jeff Chalovich","Sure.","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d turn the call back over to the presenters.","Steve Voorhees","Thank you, Shelley, and thanks for joining our call today.

The slide presentation is available on our website.","So with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.","Steven Voorhees","Thanks, James. Good morning. Thanks for joining our call today. It's an exciting time to be at WestRock. We have a lot of good things going on. On Friday, after a long wait to receive regulatory approval, we completed the KapStone acquisition. I'm enthused about the positive impact that KapStone will have on WestRock and I welcome our new team mates from KapStone and look forward to building our future together. The wait was worth it.","This morning, we reported strong fiscal fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 results. We met the key financial goals for the fiscal year that we set out at the beginning of the year. Sales increased 10% and adjusted segment EBITDA rose 26% year-over-year with adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 17.8% in fiscal 2018. Adjusted EPS rose by 56% and our adjusted operating cash flow increased 23%.","During the year, we significantly improved our Corrugated Packaging margins, generated strong cash flow, and improved our business with both capital investments in the Plymouth Packaging and Schluter acquisitions.","Moreover, during the year, we made significant strides in providing differentiated and sustainable paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace. We're helping our customers win in eCommerce markets with shelf-ready packaging, with brand activation, with plastics replacement, and with supply chain optimization that includes in many cases installing our proprietary machinery at our customers' locations. Over one-third of our sales are to customers that buy both corrugated and consumer packaging from WestRock.","In fiscal year 2019, we'll continue to implement our differentiated strategy and add to our capabilities through several strategic capital investment projects at Florence, Porto Feliz, Covington, and Mahrt and of course through the many opportunities that KapStone provides. WestRock's well-positioned to provide attractive opportunities for our team to deliver outstanding value to our customers and our stockholders.","Let's turn to the quarter. Sales increased $176 million year-over-year, adjusted segment EBITDA increased by $153 million or 23%, and adjusted EPS increased by $0.42 to $1.29 per share. Adjusted operating cash flow increased 81% from last year. KapStone performed well in the September quarter reporting a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $551 million and quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $163 million. This is well above KapStone's run rate of $500 million at the time we announced the acquisition. It's a very positive reflection on the KapStone team.","KapStone team delivered outstanding results during the uncertain period of time while we were waiting for regulatory approval. Underlying supply and demand fundamentals continue to be very favorable. Operating rates remain high across our business and backlogs remain solid.","Our total North American containerboard and Corrugated Packaging shipments grew by 4%, Mahrt shipments increased 1.7% year-over-year on a per day basis, and our Consumer Packaging business saw paperboard and converted products volumes rise by 1.7% year-over-year.","Our balance sheet is in good shape. We ended the quarter with a leverage ratio of 2.07x. With KapStone on a pro forma basis, our leverage will be about 3x excluding the impact of the $200 million of the full run rate of synergies and performance improvements that we expect from the KapStone acquisition.","Our qualified pension plans are over-funded by $300 million. Our pension investments are primarily in low-risk assets, which is an excellent place to be during this period of volatility in the financial markets. Our confidence in our long-term cash flows was demonstrated two weeks ago when the WestRock Board of Directors approved a 5.8% or $0.10 per share increase to the dividend.","We've increased the dividend by 21% since the formation of WestRock. At $1.82 a share annually, our pro forma dividend yield is more than 4%. The return of capital to stockholders is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. We've returned $2.3 billion to stockholders since WestRock was formed in the summer of 2015.","Let's turn to the Corrugated Packaging business. Corrugated Packaging industry remains attractive and growing and we've outgrown the market for the last 18 months. As I referenced earlier, WestRock's North American box shipments increased 1.7% on a per day basis and 3.3% on an absolute basis as compared to last year. This volume increase was driven by rising demand across most of our end-market segments, especially the eCommerce, food service, and retail markets.","Our integration level for the quarter was 73% and our integration level was 75% for the year. We ran very well and we're able to build our containerboard inventories back to where we'd like them to be. We're experiencing increasing demand as we enter the holiday season.","In October, our North American box shipments increased by 6.6% on an absolute basis and 2% on a per day basis with one extra shipping day in October as compared to last year. Our North American Corrugated Packaging business has made outstanding progress over the past six years. We've doubled North American EBITDA margins since 2012, which was the first full-year following the Smurfit-Stone acquisition.","During this quarter, North American corrugated adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.4%, 620 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. We have the people, the projects, and the programs in place to maintain the momentum we have to improve our performance across our system. We plan to do just that.","With the addition of KapStone, we have many opportunities to drive efficiencies across our expanded system. We expect to realize the $200 million in synergies and performance improvements by the end of fiscal 2021. Our Brazil team delivered exceptional results during the quarter with adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 27.1%. Construction at our new Porto Feliz box plant is on schedule and we expect to start producing sheets this quarter.","I'd like to take a moment and talk about the impact Hurricane Michael has had on our operations. As we previously reported, our Panama City mill sustained extensive damage and I'm extremely grateful that none of our teammates or any of their family members were injured in the storm.","Many of our teammates lost everything in the storm. We're helping them and others impacted with food, water, temporary housing, and supplies during this recovery period while providing financial assistance through the WestRock Employee Relief Fund. We remain committed to returning the Panama City to full operations and supporting the community for years to come. I visited the mill two weeks ago. I have to say I'm extremely proud of the way our Panama City team has risen to the occasion to take care of each other and also how they've worked hard to get the mill back up and running.","With the assistance of our WestRock team members across the company along with contractors and vendors, repairs are well under way. And on Saturday, we started running linerboard and expect to ramp up to a full production rate during the month of November. Our market pulp production line is expected to be operating at 50% of capacity in early December. We should be back to full operation in approximately six months.","The initial estimate of the property damage and business interruption insurance claim is $100 million. We have excellent property damage and business interruption insurance that will cover most of the cost of bringing the mill back to full operation. Except for a $15 million deductible, we expect the vast majority of the cost will be covered, but with some timing differences until insurance proceeds are received. As we recover, we've been adjusting the operation of our system to make sure that our customers are properly supplied.","We're investing in our business in Brazil to enable the Tres Barras mill to achieve its full potential. The upgrade includes the addition of Virgin pulping capacity, a new biomass boiler, a turbine generator, and debottlenecking of the two paper machines. The addition of the Virgin pulping capacity will provide more of low-cost eucalyptus pulp and allow us to eliminate our use of higher cost OCC.","The new biomass boiler and the new turbine generator will increase our electricity self-sufficiency to 85%. By debottlenecking the paper machines, we'll be able to produce total of 750,000 tonnes of containerboard per year that will support the growth at our Porto Feliz box plant while sustaining our supply to third-parties in the region.","Importantly, these investments will reduce the cost of all the tonnes we produce at the mill and will solidify our standing as owning one of the lowest cost mills in the world. When combined with our current box plant project Porto Feliz, the mill upgrade will increase Brazil's adjusted segment EBITDA by more than 125% and will improve our EBITDA margins to more than 30%.","In our Consumer Packaging side, shipments of paperboard and converted products increased approximately 1.7% year-over-year. We see rising demand in many of the consumer end markets, including healthcare, retail food, food service, liquid packaging, and beverage.","This was the fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth in our retail food business. Our customers are interested in our solutions that help them convert their plastics packaging to more sustainable paper-based alternatives. Our paperboard backlogs remained strong in the quarter and are currently between five and six weeks for all major grades.","Pulp & Paper Week published several price increases beginning in March across each of our consumer paper grades and we're implementing these increases in accordance with our contract terms. The Pulp & Paper Week published price increases affect approximately 50% of our business with the remaining business either being export business or based on mechanisms not directly related to the Pulp & Paper Week indices.","Adjusted segment EBITDA in the quarter was $275 million. The segment delivered productivity of $43 million, which was an important contributor to our results in the quarter fully offsetting increases in inflation of materials, energy and freight, and a significant part of wage inflation. We're investing in our Mahrt and Covington mills to reduce cost and increase our ability to meet the changing needs of our customers.","At our Mahrt, Alabama mill, we're replacing the existing 45-year-old coater with a new curtain coater that will improve machine reliability and reduce coating chemical usage and maintenance cost. This will improve printability, provide the flexibility for us to meet customer needs by shifting production between the two paper machines at the Mahrt mill. We executed a similar project at Mahrt in 2014.","At Covington, we're replacing the head box and upgrading other areas of our Number One paper machine to further improve our SPS products by lowering density and in the process, lower our operating cost. We expect the Mahrt and Covington projects to generate unlevered after-tax returns of at least 20%. The implementation of these projects will require an additional 72,000 tonnes of downtime during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.","The addition of KapStone to WestRock makes us a better company and brings us to a combined total nearly $20 billion in annual sales. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions has been enhanced overnight by the addition of a well situated mill and box plant system that fills in the North American footprint of our Corrugated Packaging business.","The acquisition also makes us the leading producer of kraft paper in North America and adds a new channel distribution to our portfolio. While the approval of the acquisition took us much longer than expected, the benefit is that KapStone delivered outstanding results that improved their adjusted EBITDA to $551 million. This reduced the purchase price multiple to 6.4x after synergies.","Our pro forma leverage after completion of the transaction will be about 3x, which sets us up well to return our leverage to our target of 2.25x to 2.5x. The complementary nature of our systems creates the opportunities to achieve the $200 million in synergies and performance improvements. We have a lot of pent-up energy to make these synergies happen. I've been very pleased with the response of our entire organization over the past week.","This weekend we began to ship additional WestRock boxes to several Victory locations so we're getting after it right away. I like the addition of KapStone's kraft paper products to our portfolio. This product line brings a whole new set of current and potential customers to WestRock. In fact kraft is an attractive substitute for plastic sacks, provides us with yet another alternative for us to replace plastics with sustainable paper products.","Importantly, kraft paper is an attractive grade for several of our mills that have the ability to swing production from containerboard to kraft paper and back again. KapStone's containerboard mills and box plants will be integrated into WestRock's Corrugated Packaging business led by Jeff Chalovich.","The KapStone system is just the right size for us. It's big enough to make a difference and small enough to easily fit into the existing regional structure of our North American Corrugated Packaging business. We'll operate the distribution business under the Victory name. Majority of their sales are corrugated boxes and related supplies. The business will be led by Bob Egan, who continues as President of Victory.","That concludes my comments and I will turn it over to Ward. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thanks, Steve. Turning to Slide 12, we detail the key assumptions included in our fiscal first quarter 2019 financial guidance. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA in the first quarter to be between $737 million and $767 million as compared to $802 million in our fiscal fourth quarter.","Walking through the sequential bridge, we expect the acquisition to contribute approximately $90 million in adjusted segment EBITDA for the two months during the quarter. The next set of items that impact our adjusted segment EBITDA are based on the WestRock business excluding KapStone.","Pricing will be higher in both segments as a result of the flow through of previously published price increases. Volumes are expected to decline as a result of seasonality in our consumer business. We will take 60,000 tonnes of additional scheduled maintenance downtime across our corrugated and consumer mills and we have two fewer shipping days in the box business.","Input costs should be stable sequentially. Higher group insurance cost and a decline in non-cash pension income should reduce sequential EBITDA by $20 million. Typically, group insurance costs increase in the fourth calendar quarter as employees reach their deductibles. The recovery at the Panama City mill is a complex situation.","To clarify our earnings guidance for both the quarter and the year, adjusted EPS will exclude both Hurricane related damages and increased operating costs as well as associated insurance claim proceeds. Adjusted EPS will include the negative financial impact from lost production.","For the first fiscal quarter, we estimate $45 million negative impact from lost production. We expect increased D&A of $0.15 per share, higher interest expense of $0.09 per share, and an adjusted tax rate of 24.5%, and a slightly higher share count due to the election by certain KapStone shareholders to take WestRock stock for the purchase price. These items aggregate to $0.29.","Moving to Slide 13. We expect to invest approximately $1.5 billion of capital in our business in FY 2019. Our base capital, including KapStone, should be about $950 million to $1 billion with roughly half going to maintenance and half invested in high return generating projects. In FY 2019, we will also invest approximately $500 million in our strategic projects including Florence, Mahrt, Covington, and our two projects in Brazil.","Once in service, these investments should generate more than $240 million in EBITDA for our business. As Steve mentioned earlier, we also increased our dividend to an annual rate of $1.82 per share. Initially we have funded the KapStone acquisition with approximately $4.4 billion drawn under our bank term loan facility and other committed lines and cash on hand.","Post KapStone, we will look to potentially refinance some of the term loan with other debt capital. We have provided our estimated FY 2019 interest expense and interest income assumptions in the appendix. We expect to get back to our target leverage ratio of 2.25x to 2.5x during fiscal 2020.","On Slide 14, we outline our full-year guidance. We remain confident in our business, overall industry conditions, and our expected outlook in fiscal 2019. Our guidance includes 11 months of KapStone's results. We expect net sales to exceed $19 billion. Key growth drivers include the KapStone revenue, the full-year impact of previously published price increases in both segments, growth in corrugated box volumes, and stable volumes in consumer.","These increases are partially offset by the change in reporting of our recycling business to record external sales as a reduction of cost of goods sold. The recycling business is now accounted for as a procurement function. We also will have lower land and development sales as we complete the monetization program. We expect adjusted EBITDA to increase to approximately $3.6 billion. We've highlighted the KapStone contribution to our fiscal 2019 guidance.","In addition, you see the key assumptions across the rest of our business, including the flow through of the previously published price increases in both segments. These gains are partially offset by inflation, the impact of increased annual outages, and the implementation of our strategic capital projects.","In addition, the impact from Hurricane Michael, lower pension income, FX, and other items will have a negative impact of $100 million. We expect adjusted EPS to be approximately $4.60 per share driven by higher adjusted EBITDA partially offset by higher D&A and interest expense. In addition, we expect an adjusted book tax rate of 24% to 25% and 265 million shares outstanding.","Adjusted operating cash flow will grow to approximately $2.55 billion. Higher earnings will be partially offset by higher cash tax rate, acquisition related interest, and reduced cash flow from the wrap-up of our land and development business. This higher cash tax rate is due to the utilization of most available credits in FY 2018 and the positive benefit in FY 2018 of various tax planning efforts that we executed. To help you in your modeling, other assumptions for the full-year are included in the appendix on Slide 19.","I'll now turn it back over to Steve for closing comments. Steve?","Steven Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. We've just completed a very good year, strong execution and strong results. Market conditions remain favorable. We're experiencing continued solid demand across the large majority of our markets. We're experiencing high operating rates and strong backlogs.","The addition of KapStone greatly enhances WestRock's geographic presence, ability to serve our customers, provides us significant opportunity for synergies and value creation. We're entering fiscal 2019 with sustained momentum and even stronger platform. We expect to productively deploy our capital and deliver growth in sales, earnings, and cash flows for the benefit of stockholders.","In closing, global demand for containerboard continues to rise roughly in line with global GDP and the world realizes that North America is attractively positioned with supplies of Virgin fiber, recycled fiber, and energy. A number of competitors have announced containerboard capacity additions in response to this increase in global demand. We are well-positioned in this competitive market to provide unique value to our customers through our broad portfolio of differentiated sustainable paper and packaging solutions.","For our strong execution and capital allocation, we'll improve our margins and grow our cash flow and use the strong cash flow to reinvest in our business and make acquisitions that support our strategy. We will return capital to stockholders by increasing our dividend over time and through share repurchases. This is a formula that provides significant opportunities for our team, our customers, and investors over the short and long term.","Now that concludes my prepared remarks. James, we're ready for Q&A.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience to give everybody a chance to ask a question, please limit your question to one with a follow-up as needed. We'll get to as many as time allows. Marcella, can we please take our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Yes, and good morning. Thank you for all the details. My question mainly has to do with what we saw in the last several months and thanks for the October data. But in particular we saw a real big surge across the industry in export volume and I didn't know what was the genesis of that? Was there \u2013 I noticed that some of the published prices had really jumped farther than what we have seen domestically say since 2016, but I didn't know if it was just because of the attractiveness of those markets or if there was something else going on there and should we see these export trends continue?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Hey, Chip. Good morning. It's Jeff. So, I can speak for WestRock. As you recall, our ability this year to make our shipment since we've been running on basically full the entire year. This is the first quarter we didn't have any maintenance downtime so we were actually able to do catch-up on orders we've been pushing out all year.","So the last quarter, our shipments went up into export although for the year we're down over 100,000 tonnes in the export market, but we use this opportunity to catch-up in markets that we hadn't been participating where we had had customers and continue to push out. As you noted, our pricing has been stable in those markets and we took the opportunity to catch-up for our customers that we had been pushing out for most of this year. ","Chip Dillon","That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. You mentioned in the guidance, Ward, the $100 million of additional expense and I assume that includes the portion of Michael that is tied to production not to the other aspects you mentioned. But could you give us a rough breakdown on how much is that impact versus the lower pension and the FX?","Ward Dickson","Sure. So the lower pension is approximately a third of the $100 million, the lower FX is another third, and then the residual \u2013 the timing of the recovery of the claims from our insurance carrier on the lost production is a portion of the remaining one-third of that $100 million.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire","Hi. Good morning, guys and congrats on closing on KapStone.","Steven Voorhees","Thank you.","Brian Maguire","Ward, a question on the guidance as well. I just wondered what sort of commodity cost inflation you're expecting in 2019 and maybe you can just provide kind of a rough ballpark of where we were in 2018 for context there, and I think some companies are calling for an acceleration maybe in the 4% range or 5% range, but we're also seeing a little bit of flattening out in some key costs like freight. So I was wondering if you could also just kind of comment on what kind of trends you're seeing as we start the fiscal year off here.","Ward Dickson","Sure, so we're assuming between $280 million and $300 million of inflation for the full-year next year embedded in that assumption, because of the decline in OCC in the first half of fiscal 2018, we actually have a year-over-year decline of OCC of about $25 million.","So our average for the full-year of FY 2019 versus FY 2018 for OCC is down about $5 per ton. It's fairly stable in the first half of the year with current levels and then we have a small increase projected in the second half. We do have freight cost. Freight cost's up 5% on a year-over-year basis this year. It was closer to 10% and then embedded in that overall $280 million to $300 million obviously includes wage, benefit, and other cost inflation.","Brian Maguire","All right, great, that's helpful. And then just one maybe for Steve or Jeff, just on the decision and the timing to do the Brazil mill project now? You obviously have a lot going on in the Company with the KapStone integration, the project in Florence, the box plant in Brazil. Just wondered if \u2013 how you think about the execution risk on that and the complexity of all the different projects you've got going on right now?","Steven Voorhees","I feel very good about our ability to execute the Brazil project. We actually pushed it out a little bit because of the box plant and so they've been well prepared for a number of months to go through and execute it. So they really could not be better prepared. Jim Porter, who many of you know has been spending a lot of time in Brazil and he's been there for a long time. But I know he was here last week, he's going to be there again this week. But I feel very comfortable with our ability to execute that project.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Babcock","Good morning. This is actually John Babcock on the line for George. Just want to quickly follow-up and it maybe a little bit early even to comment on this. But what sort of opportunities do you see to invest CapEx in the KapStone business? And then on that point, can you also talk about how KapStone might change the overall logistics across the WestRock platform?","Steven Voorhees","Jeff?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Hi, good morning. So we've budgeted about $150 million in the incremental for the KapStone system and we believe that's sufficient based on what we know of the system to invest. We think we can do the same types of things we've done in our system, in the mills in the box plants. Their system gives us an opportunity to optimize our strategic sourcing model.","So there's lots of opportunities for areas where we commonly overlap in domestic, our trades, and our exports to really optimize for freight, for trend, for grades, and that's the work that starts literally today going forward. But that's a large part of the synergies of the $200 million, a large part of that is really in the productivity gains, the supply chain optimization, optimizing plant and customer pairing. So there's a lot of opportunity in the acquisition.","Steven Voorhees","And just the capital at the run rate we anticipate.","Jeffrey Chalovich","That's right.","John Babcock","And then just one quick follow-on here, just it appears you're expecting greater than $550 million in EBITDA, which seems to apply around kind of $600 million in full-year EBITDA for the business or maybe a bit more than that. Can you talk about some of the assumptions that gets you there and then also how you're thinking about the trajectory of the synergy capture?","Ward Dickson","So your assumptions are correct. I mean where they've got the \u2013 embedded in the KapStone business is you also have the flow through of the previously published price increases for the full-year on a year-over-year basis, similar inflation assumptions and volume assumptions that we have across our base box and containerboard business.","In addition, we are projecting that we're going to get to a run rate of synergies by the end of the first year of approximately $65 million to $70 million. So we'll get to achieve a portion of that across our productivity initiatives during the fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from Davidson. Your line is open.","Steve Chercover","Thank you. I had a question about the basis of the KapStone assets. So if my math is reasonable, depreciation is up about $100 million more than the KapStone's previous run rate and that kind of surprises me since we know the assets weren't brand new. So I'm just wondering do you have a lot of latitude in terms of how you write-up assets in an acquisition?","Ward Dickson","Well, so we are just now going through the valuation process of and the purchase price allocation. So our original estimate was the combined D&A would be between \u2013 it's going to be between $305 million and $310 million, which includes their base run rate plus the write-up and the purchase price allocation between the assets, goodwill, and the intangibles. So we are just starting to do that work now and we'll update you as we complete it.","Steve Chercover","Okay. Well, congratulations on getting that done and it's nice that it was operating so well. One other quick question about capital allocation and specifically as it pertains to returning it to shareholders. If the dividend's north of 4%, would that be an indication that the stock is too low and therefore buying back stock becomes more compelling than boosting the dividends in the future?","Steven Voorhees","I think it's hard to make a judgment between those two things. I think if you look at our overall capital allocation, our leverage ratio at 3x. We're going to have an increased focus on reducing that. Beyond that, we'll go through \u2013 I'd say our consistent process of allocating capital across our business.","Think you will see and as demonstrated by our capital expenditures for this year, we think we've got terrific opportunities to invest back into our business. The weight of those projects is on generating returns by reducing cost so by generating very high returns on these projects, we think that's a very good use of capital. And as I said, we'll look at beyond that first on reducing debt and then as we have the dividend and we'll continue to look at share repurchases.","Steve Chercover","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Debbie Jones","Hi, good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie Jones","Thanks, my first question on KapStone. I just wanted to see if I could flush out some of the synergies that you're calling out a little bit more. How much of that is related to mill improvement versus improvement at the plant level and specifically if there is anything to note around investment at Charleston? And then on the box plant side, how long does it really take to implement the strategies that you have in your legacy business into the system at KapStone?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Sure. So Debbie, there's about 75% of the overall synergies lie in fiber energy mill performance improvements, the mill network optimization, and then supply chain optimization. So that's a large preponderance of that \u2013 the synergies.","You have the converting footprint optimization, plant and customer pairings are the other part of that 75% and then you get administrative efficiencies, procurement, and the Victory integration is the other 25% of those efficiencies.","Again in our run rate of $150 million in capital that we've targeted for the KapStone assets, we believe there's \u2013 that's well funded for all of the projects we'll need to do in any of the mills and the box plants moving forward.","Debbie Jones","Okay. And then second question on your segment performance. I actually got Corrugated, which is quite strong and Consumer generally in line except for the volume mix side of things at least versus my expectation. And I was wondering if you could break out on the volume price mix side where there may have been some surprises or not. And then in your implied guidance for 2019, is volume growth a driver of improvement year-over-year?","Robert Feeser","Hi, Debbie. This is Bob. Just on the volume mix side so as we announced that our overall volumes were up about 1.7% and that's paperboard and converted products, we did see lower display sales as well as lower pulp sales, which would have impacted that volume mix bar that you're referencing.","Debbie Jones","Yes. And so is it \u2013 should we expect that to continue to be a negative in 2019 or is there just something seasonal that because obviously you're converting product shipments are doing quite nicely?","Ward Dickson","Yes. We said the contribution of volumes across our Consumer business were going to be stable in the assumption on a year-over-year basis for FY 2019 versus 2018.","Debbie Jones","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Mark Wilde","Good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","Jeff or Ward, I wanted to just come back to kind of KapStone CapEx looking a bit further out. There have been a couple of issues that have been discussed around the KapStone assets, the recovery boilers at Charleston and then the potential debottlenecking out at Longview, and I wondered if you could just sort of address both of those issues?","Jeffrey Chalovich","So they had a very successful recovery boiler install, I think this last year that was reported I think a quarter or so ago. So we haven't seen anything there that we're concerned about. And then as a matter of course when we look at assets, we're always looking to elevate the constraint in the system whether that's on the paper machines or through the box plant.","So we'll continue to look at process, at capital investments, opportunities with Lean Six Sigma, what we do on our system today. And as we get more embedded into the operations, we'll have a clearer view and we expect to do that starting this morning. We have people at all the mills, box plants, and corporate headquarters. So we are in the facilities as of this morning first thing and we'll be there for all the shifts and our work's beginning.","Mark Wilde","Okay and Jeff just to come back to that Charleston issue. So I thought there were a couple of recovery boilers down there that might need work, can you just clarify that?","Jeffrey Chalovich","So there's nothing again that I've seen that is going to put us outside of what we project in our more $150 million, Mark. So as we get further into the assets and understand what the capital plans were, I'll be better able to comment on that moving forward.","Mark Wilde","Right and then just a follow-on. Bob Feeser, I wondered if you could put a little more color around the softness in pulp and displays in Consumer Packaging. It would seem like this last quarter should have been a good seasonal quarter for displays. And I also wondered if you can just talk about any potential to move these boxboard hikes through more quickly. I mean it is pretty striking when you look at this quarter's numbers that even with the market so tight, cost was \u2013 didn't offset pricing in the quarter?","Robert Feeser","So maybe I'll take the pulp and we'll talk about displays in just a minute. The pulp decrease was really relatively small in our overall system and within our mix. There will be changes like that from quarter-to-quarter.","Just a quick comment on the pricing, Mark, so as you know, there have been six published increases in 2018 and we've had two of those across our \u2013 each of the major grades with a $35 published decrease that flowed through our first half of fiscal 2018.","You can see from the consumer bridge that we captured about $18 million of that in the fourth quarter from the increases that were published in March given our roughly three quarter lag to capture.","And just as a reminder, the pulp and paper price changes apply to about 50% of our business. The remainder of it is negotiated contracts, some that includes cost models and inflation industries, and we're always negotiating with our customers around commercial terms. And the bottom line, the market continues to be very competitive and we're succeeding by really creating value for our customers around our differentiated solutions.","Steven Voorhees","Mark, on display, you said it was a seasonally strong quarter and that's true and it was even stronger last year than it was this year. So that's why you have sequential \u2013 you have a year-over-year sales decline in display.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Fair enough. Steve. I did want to just also kind of compliment you on these containerboard margins. It's pretty impressive what's happened over the last four or five years just you relative to the competitors?","Steven Voorhees","Thank you for noticing. It's much appreciated. A lot of work has been done by the team to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo Security. Your line is open.","Gabe Hajde","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on the KapStone deal. First one, kind of centers around global flows for OCC, one of the things that I found peculiar was that export tonnage is actually up, but yet prices are down. So I was just curious if you could comment at all on what you're seeing with I guess export demand versus local demand here?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Sure, this is Jeff. So from our exports, what we're seeing is really only the high class fiber so Number 12, which is a cleaner fiber. That remains I'd say stable to strong. And then the rest that's been more mixed office waste or lower class OCC has not. So there had been a bunch of licenses issued, but probably only 50% of this is to China specific going into the country.","There are some other Asian countries taking more in cleaning so they're cleaning it and then shipping it, but we see that falling off also as these other countries are going to do the same thing we believe from what we've been told on their waste in fiber. But from our system, the exports are not up, they're down and the only thing we're seeing that's maintained is really the Number 12 OCC in our world.","Gabe Hajde","Okay. Thank you. And then I guess a question on the integration rate, you guys at around 75% in the full-year and I think KapStone was something around 70%. I guess the risks or the opportunities around that in terms of increasing the vertical integration rate or the appetite to do that.","Jeffrey Chalovich","Sure. So our appetite to do that continues. So we still want to move through the 80%. KapStone keeps us in that 74% range 74%, 73%, 74%, so we believe with the integration of the Victory tonnage so shipping more boxes into Victory keeps us mid 70%s and we will continue to look at opportunities to certainly grow organically with our expanded system and for bolt-on acquisitions that we can further integrate where it makes sense.","Gabe Hajde","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you, and congrats on the KapStone, a couple of questions on the Consumer side, and you'd mentioned that the 50% affected by the PPW pricing and then there is some domestic stuff where you have other mechanisms and then you also added that export was perhaps done differently. Can you expand on that a little bit? How much of your Consumer business is export and what's happening in those markets?","Robert Feeser","Yes. Mark, it's Bob. Roughly about 25% to 30% of our business is outside of North America and much of that business is not linked to PPW. It would include business like tobacco and liquid packaging where we have long-term contracts associated with those pieces of business and they would typically run from one to four years.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And so how are they have been relatively stable?","Robert Feeser","Relatively stable.","Mark Weintraub","I'm sorry, on the price side, I guess you \u2013 so you're getting hit by higher costs, but not necessarily because of the way the contracts are put in able to recoup it on the price side given the length of the contracts. Is that the way to think of it?","Robert Feeser","Yes. The contracts extend over one to four years and the mechanisms for pricing changes vary by contract.","Mark Weintraub","Okay and then the one other thing again on the consumer side. On the one hand, when we look at the supply demand dynamics, it's looked like it's been very, very good. On the other hand, you do mention that it is very competitive. Can you help kind of align those two observations? Why do you think it's so especially competitive given that we're in an environment where I mean it would seem that the producers would be in a pretty good spot?","Robert Feeser","Well, it's always a competitive market. But maybe just to provide a little bit of context by grade, which might be helpful. The CRB and CNK portions of the market are tight and we've had good success realizing the previously published price increases for those portions of the business that are linked to PPW. CRB is more weighted to PPW and CNK and SPS are less than half linked to PPW.","In SPS were the previously published increases in the U.S. folding carton business, we're seeing those flow through in our business. Much of the remaining, as I mentioned, SPS business is really international business and in end markets that aren't linked to PPW and again those are tobacco, liquid packaging, and other portions of the business where we compete on a global basis.","Mark Weintraub","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Paul Quinn","Yes. Thanks very much and great to see that you were finally able to get KapStone done.","Steven Voorhees","Thank you.","Paul Quinn","Just a question on you highlighted the flexibility to be able to move capacity between kraft paper and containerboard. What specifically maybe you could talk to on a mill basis, where do you have that flexibility and how important will be that going forward? What's your opportunity there?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Hey, Paul, it's Jeff. So if you look at the mills, the combined mill system in Dublin, we have that ability today. Roanoke Rapids has that capability so does Tacoma and also Longview. So, it gives us optionality on line or medium or multiple kraft grades. So as we look at the demand profiles for our business, the customers' demand. We'll look to optimize the mills, the machines, the grades, the mix, the freight altogether. So that's the opportunity we have as a combined system.","Paul Quinn","Okay. And then just following up on the \u2013 I guess the opportunity at Victory. How much of that is embedded into the 2019 guidance?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Well, Victory we expect to have fully integrated in the fiscal 2019. So, we have 100,000 tonnes and we believe we can do that this fiscal year?","Paul Quinn","Great, that's all I had. Thanks a lot, guys.","Ward Dickson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly","Thanks. How substantial will the shift in sourcing for the West Coast customers in containerboard be? You've talked about replacing East Coast tonnes with West, but the KapStone system was running pretty full. So are you going to be turning away business out there to replace it with better business and is that in a big way? The second question is one of the benefits you cited from KapStone is increasing the Virgin ratio. Where does that mix stand in containerboard specifically?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Hey, Mark. So the containerboard will be 75\/25 with the KapStone acquisition. And then on the West Coast, I wouldn't say that we would be turning away business. I think we're looking to optimize trades, our freights and looking for \u2013 we're always looking for opportunities to upgrade the mix, but I don't see us having to turn away customers to do that. I think that's just working with our trade partners, our plant and customer pairings; but I don't see us having to turn away customers to do that.","Mark Connelly","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ward, just couple of questions, one on the CapEx guidance this year of $1.5 billion, do you have a sense of how much growth CapEx you'll spend in fiscal 2020 just at least based on what will bleed over from Florence and Tres Barras? And just more broadly on the growth CapEx issue, can you talk about what it's been on average historically?","Ward Dickson","So, let me talk about the strategic projects first and we've always given you somewhat the mix in our base CapEx. So on the strategic projects again we are across Florence, Porto Feliz, Mahrt, Covington, and Tres Barras. That's going to contribute about $500 million of CapEx in fiscal 2019. That number should drop to approximately half of that rate in fiscal 2020 because we'll just be at the tail end of Florence. This is a high investment year for Florence.","We'll invest about $100 million in Tres Barras this year and almost $200 million next year. But then the Porto Feliz, Mahrt, and Covington projects will be done as we exit this fiscal year. So the strategic projects' contribution should fall from $500 million to down to closer to $250 million for next year. And then we've talked about the fact that our base CapEx is allocated almost equivalently between return generating and maintenance projects.","Adam Josephson","Thanks Ward. And just on the inflation guidance, forgive me if I missed it, but I think you said $280 million to $300 million this year.","Ward Dickson","Yes.","Adam Josephson","What was that number in fiscal 2018? And then you talked about OCC as well, I think being down $25 million or $5 a ton on average for fiscal 2019. When do you have OCC prices ticking back up in fiscal 2019?","Ward Dickson","They're fairly stable in the first half and then they start to tick up in the second half for fiscal 2019. If I look at our total inflation story for FY 2018, if you just tally up the bridges that we gave you every quarter for the full year, the inflation would have been approximately $240 million and what, that's remarkably the same as the guidance that we gave you at the beginning of the year.","But there was a lot of pretty dramatic swings in some of the key assumptions underneath it. Obviously we had the benefit from the decline in recycled fiber, but that was dramatically offset by or directly offset by the increases in chemicals and freight and logistics during the year.","So again in aggregate across all our cost categories including wage and benefits, all of our input cost, and transportation; it was approximately $240 million in FY 2018 and we are projecting it to be between $280 million and $300 million in FY 2019.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. And is just that KapStone adding to the number for 2019 so is it really different apples-to-apples, if you know what I mean?","Ward Dickson","No, it's not because \u2013 what we tried to give you was guidance of the KapStone contribution and then the price inflation assumptions across our base business. So it's an apples-to-apples comparison?","Adam Josephson","Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Marcella, and thank you to our audience for joining our call today. As always, reach out to us if you have any questions, we're happy to help. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

The material for today\u2019s call will be available on the company\u2019s website, www.westrock.com. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","I\u2019ll now turn the meeting over to Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.","Steve Voorhees","Okay, thanks. Good morning. This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. Thanks for taking the time to listen to our call today. I\u2019m joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing our results for the September quarter of 2015, which is the first quarter for which we\u2019re reporting the results of WestRock.","During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates, and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These include our WestRock S4 filing, the most recent 10-Ks and 10-Qs, followed by our predecessor companies, the recent Form-10 filed to enable the tax-free spend of our specialty chemicals business.","We\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. You may have noticed in our press release and on page 19 of our earnings call deck that we provided a comparison of our results for the September quarter of 2015 to the September quarter of 2014. This comparison uses the reported results of predecessor companies as adjusted for our new segment and other merger-related accounting items, including application of a consistent method for allocating corporate cost. We\u2019ve provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation that\u2019s available on our website.","We performed well in our first quarter of operations as WestRock. The most appropriate place for me to start is by thanking all of my WestRock coworkers who have continued to take care of our customers, operate safely, and deliver strong results in a competitive business environment all while working extremely hard to take advantage of the many opportunities that we have as a newly merged company.","We continue to have enthusiastic alignment across the company about our aspiration to be the global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging markets. We\u2019re making significant strides in areas that are driving value from the merger, including the integration of our organizations, the realization of the merger-related synergies and performance improvements, the opportunities we have to provide a broad range of paper and packaging solutions to help our customers succeed in their markets.","We reported $0.93 of adjusted earnings per share and generated $268 million of free cash flow after adding back the after-tax cost of transaction fees and restructuring cost. We executed exceptionally well in our packaging businesses. Our North American box business increased volumes by 2.9% on a per day basis in the quarter. This compares to a less than 1% increase for the industry over the same timeframe.","Our containerboard mill system is operating efficiently. The North American corrugated packaging business earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 20%. The corrugated packaging business in Brazil is operating exceptionally well and earned adjusted EBITDA margins of 28% in the September quarter.","Our consumer mill system is also operating well, and we\u2019re implementing published price increases across the recycled branch. There is positive momentum in folding carton, home health and beauty, and merchandising displays, and I\u2019ll have more color on each of those shortly. Specialty chemical sales of activated carbon and asphalt additives were at record levels. But those gains were more than offset by lower sales to oil fuel drilling and industrial markets.","EBITDA margins were 24.9%. Ingevity\u2019s initial Form-10 was filed on October 6. We\u2019re targeting an approximate March 1, 2016 spend date. We\u2019re progressing toward our $1 billion in annualized synergy and performance improvements to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018. We generated annualized run rate savings at quarter end in excess of $150 million, and we expect annualized run rate savings of, at least, $400 million by the end of fiscal year 2016.","We\u2019re executing on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. We ended the quarter at 2.08 leverage, slightly under our stated target leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.50 times. We completed the SP Fiber acquisition on October 1. The Dublin, Georgia mill is an excellent asset and provides a valuable product mix and adds logistical flexibility within our system.","The Newberg, Oregon newsprint and containerboard machines were idled in our first month of operation, due to market conditions in newsprint and our need to balance supply and demand in our containerboard mill system. We continue to expect performance improvements in excess of $50 million over three years for the transaction to be accretive in the second-half of fiscal 2016.","On October 12, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Grupo Gondi for our packaging businesses in Mexico. Gondi is a high-quality paperboard manufacturer and packaging converter for many local and global brand name customers. Our partnership will help grow our presence in the attractive Mexico market. We expect to begin operations as a joint venture as soon as we receive Mexican regulatory approval, which we expect will take 4 to 6 months.","We repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $60.20. We were and continue to be limited in the number of shares we can buy as a result of our need to maintain, at least, a 50.1% ownership interest by legacy and WB stockholders as of July 1, 2015. This continuity of ownership is necessary to preserve the tax-free separation of the specialty chemicals business from WestRock. We have been and are able to buy back shares up to the exact overlapping investor ownership of our predecessor companies at the specific fund level as of July 1. We have sufficient repurchase opportunity available to us to operate within our target leverage ratio range.","I will now provide more details on our overall results and performance in each business segment before turning it over to Ward, and then I\u2019ll come back to provide thoughts on the outlook for our December quarter.","When we compare WestRock\u2019s results in the September quarter to combined recast results in the same quarter of last year, sales declined by $203 million, or 5%. This decline was largely comprised of $141 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations and $44 million of revenue from the European tobacco converting business sold earlier in the year.","Adjusted segment EBITDA, net of corporate cost, declined by $80 million compared to last year, due to foreign currency translation impacts of $26 million. The absence of the $23 million gain we recorded last year due to the write-up of spare parts inventory in our mill system and $26 million in the lower pension income. WestRock\u2019s credit agreement EBITDA and EBITDA margins are at last 12 months are in excess of $2.5 billion and 16.9% respectively.","Let\u2019s turn to each of our segments. WestRock\u2019s corrugated packaging team performed well in the September quarter, especially considering the headwinds we faced in the quarter from a weaker global economy and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales declined by $75 million, or 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up by $20 million, or 1%. Of the $95 million in currency headwinds, about one-half was in Brazil, one-third was due to the Canadian dollar, and most of the rest was the Mexican peso.","Segment income was lowered by $39 million, with $23 million of that related to the write-up of spare parts last year and $15 million related to currency impacts in Canada, Brazil, and India. Overall, segment EBITDA margin was 19.4% with our North American corrugated margin at 20% and our Brazil margin at 28%. As I referenced earlier, our North American box volumes increased by 2.9% compared to last year, and box pricing in North America was stable. Our box system has been very successful in the market by focusing on quality and on-time delivery in combination with innovation that\u2019s relevant to our customers\u2019 needs.","This approach has enabled us to retain existing customers and grow our customer base over time, including gains in the quarter with customers for protein and processed foods, snacks, dairy, and e-commerce. Our success has been and will be defined by how well we operate on a day-to-day basis in each of our plants and with each of our customers. The scale of the WestRock organization has supported our local success to our capital investment, our investment in people, and connecting our coworkers so as to make it easier to share knowledge on how to succeed across the company and with our customers. We\u2019ve continued our volume growth in October by increasing sales on a per day basis by more than 3% over last year.","Our North American corrugated shipments in the quarter declined by 15,000 tons compared to the June quarter, and 57,000 tons, or 2.7% compared to last year. Export volumes declined by 29,000 tons compared to last year. Our overall export pricing declined $9 per ton compared to the June quarter and $37 per ton compared to last year. Prices of containerboard to third-party domestic customers have been within a $5 per ton range since the summer of 2014.","We took approximately 76,000 tons of downtime during the quarter, all except 3,000 tons being economic downtime. In October, we took about 95,000 tons of downtime in our corrugated mill system, with approximately 55,000 tons being economic downtime, the remainder being maintenance downtime at our Florence mill. We\u2019ve consistently operated our system in a way that balances production with our customer demand. We plan and schedule this balance on an ongoing basis and take actions as needed, including slowbacks, economic downtime, maintenance downtime, and permanent closures.","Our goal is to pursue the actions that we believe will optimize our mill system thus producing the best economic and operating results for WestRock and our customers. We don\u2019t publicly announce our actions. We communicate our plans to the employees, customers, and suppliers who will be most directly impacted. This past month is an example of this planning and execution as we took action on several facilities. With the October 1 completion of the SP Fiber transaction, we were able to reassess our overall mill system to determine the optimal way to meet our customers\u2019 demand.","Following this assessment, we announced indefinite downtime in both Fernandina Beach and Uncasville to immediately match our production to customers\u2019 orders. The following week we announced the permanent closure of the 310,000 ton Coshocton, Ohio mill, which will occur in late November to provide an orderly mill closure and consumption of raw materials such as chemicals, wood, and recovered fiber. The closure of Coshocton will reduce our annual operating cost by $33 million and avoid an additional $4 million annually in maintenance capital expenditures.","The same week we announced an indefinite idling of our Newberg mill due to the unprofitable nature of the newsprint business and an inadequate order book on containerboard and bag reds [ph]. The mill will be idled in mid-November. We\u2019ve retained the optionality on the two excellent paper machines at Newberg in the event west coast demand warrants a restart. All of these actions have been well planned and executed and went according to our expectations.","When we take economic downtime, we communicate that it is indefinite because the period of downtime may change with market conditions or lead to a permanent closure. We will continue to operate our system focused on our customers. Our plan is to take 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime in our corrugated mills during the December quarter. The Fernandina Beach paper machine has been restarted. The Huntsville mill is being restarted mid-month as planned to meet our customer demand. We\u2019re currently operating with 56,000 tons more inventory than we operated with one year ago.","This additional inventory has helped improve on-time delivery and customer satisfaction with both our internal and external box plan customers, and has also reduced logistics cost. These benefits far outweigh the carrying cost of increased investment and inventory. Based on our forecasted sales and major maintenance and capital downtime plan, our containerboard inventories will gradually build an additional 30,000 tons from the end of September until they peak in January\/February timeframe. Then we would expect them to return to our current level over the following few months.","In Brazil the economic situation continues to be challenging, and our great team in the regions managed to continue to deliver very strong results, including adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.2% and sales growth of 10% on a local currency basis. While industry box demand declined by more than 5%, we grew box volume by 3% year-over-year with strength in proteins, produce, and export markets. In September our mill in Brazil set new production and shipment records.","The interaction between our North America and Brazilian corrugated team has benefited both businesses to been able to drive improved productivity at our mills and box plants. In 2016, GDP in Brazil is expected to decline by approximately 2%, and industrial production is expected to decline by approximately 6%. While our corrugated business in Brazil is not immune to these challenges, we expect to continue to perform well due to our high-quality assets, customer service, and the differentiation of our virgin-based paper and packaging offerings.","In the Consumer Packaging segment, overall results reflected good commercial and operational execution in the face of some difficult macro headwinds related to the stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales in the segment declined $140 million, or 8%, when compared to last year. This includes $37 million of negative impact from currency. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $14 million lower due to $8 million of foreign exchange impact and $4 million from the sale of the European tobacco business. Segment EBITDA margins were 15.6%.","In the paperboard markets, our SBS food service volumes grew and our general folding carton and food markets are doing well. Industry SBS backlogs are 393,000 tons, somewhat lower than the 454,000 tons at the same time last year. Our backlogs are 3.5 weeks. We\u2019re making very good progress integrating the Carolina brand that we acquired earlier this year. Sales during the quarter were at a rate equivalent to 180,000 tons per year, and we expect to fully transition manufacturing to our facilities by the end of December.","One of the first opportunities from the merger was to integrate SBS tons into our folding carton system and we\u2019re already more than halfway to achieving a full annual run rate of 50,000 tons by the end of December. During the quarter, these domestic SBS shipments more than offset softer exports for tobacco and liquid packaging grades. Industry backlogs for coated recycled board remained strong at approximately 165,000 tons, which is more than 40% higher than this time last year.","WestRock\u2019s CRB backlogs are greater than 4% \u2013 f our weeks. We are moving production of our millennium board product from our Dallas and Strasburg mills to the Mahrt mill. We\u2019re backfilling both Dallas and Strasburg with additional CRB business. Demand for CNK remains solid, and our backlogs are nearly 4 weeks. Mill shipments grew by more than 3%, supported by growth from our beverage system.","In North America, we largely offset declines in carbonated volumes with gains with our larger brewer customers, continued growth with craft brewers, and gains in water. In Europe, we saw stronger sales with our larger brewer customers. On the Asia-Pacific region, we saw improvement in carbonated soft drinks and dairy packaging. Our broader folding carton business also performed extremely well with share gains in new business in categories such as on-the-go foods, offsetting declines in areas such as cereal.","Our general folding carton volumes were up 2% during the quarter, a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year growth. Our operational performance in our carton facilities was also strong with better plant loading and efficiency gains. Our home health and beauty business improved income and margins due to favorable mix from sales of trigger sprayers and healthcare dispensing systems, as well as productivity gains.","And in our merchandising displays business, we saw a strong rebound with quarterly earnings up 55% over the prior year. After a challenging year that included some sales decline, we\u2019re seeing signs of growth and a strengthening market for promotional displays. Our decisions over the last couple of years to strategically invest capital to lower our cost has had a significant positive impact.","We\u2019ve invested in our innovation platform and that\u2019s supporting our growth in new markets, including recently earning awards of new business that helped end the year on a very positive note. Many of our customers are learning more about our capabilities. We\u2019ve taken advantage of these opportunities to discuss our full product line and to learn about our customers\u2019 objectives, so we can develop paper and packaging solutions to help our customers meet their objectives.","Specialty Chemicals business continues to perform well in the face of the slowdown in drilling and other industrial activity. Adjusted EBITDA margins remain very attractive at 24.9%, even if sales declined by $26 million compared to last year. Ingevity is starting up a new activated carbon plant in China this quarter and expanding our pine chemicals plant in Brazil at the first of the year. The activated carbon plant in China will provide needed capacity for a global system that supports the growing automotive sector. We\u2019re making good progress in qualifying the new production with our automotive customers in Asia and beyond, and expect sales to ramp up in the first-half of next year.","The December quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for specialty chemicals. This is principally due to the winter slowdown in the road paving activity. We expect continued challenges in the oilfield sector, which impacts the segment sales levels and margins. I\u2019m very pleased that both Michael Wilson and John Fortson have joined Ingevity as CEO and CFO, respectively. They both bring tremendous and highly relevant experience to the business. We have confidence in their ability to lead Ingevity through these challenges and into a period of growth as an independent company. The spinoff of Ingevity is moving forward. The initial Form-10 was filed and we\u2019re targeting an approximate March 1, 2016, spin date.","The land and development business continues to make good progress on their major projects in the Charleston region. The business had a fantastic quarter from a revenue standpoint with $45 million in revenue, including a $34 million gain related to the 68\u2013 I mean, the sale for $34 million related to the 6,800-acre site that Volvo acquired to build their new U.S. manufacturing facility. But due to the impact of purchase price accounting revaluing their existing projects to fair value, they lost $3 million on a GAAP basis.","The step-up in book value had a $15 million negative impact on the segment income in the quarter. This marking to fair market value of our land portfolio in this business will reduce future profitability on existing projects, but does not impact future cash flows. As part of the valuation work, we have developed a project-by-project valuation of the partnership, which for our share is over $400 million. The experienced team in this business is executing on a plan to maximize this potential value. We\u2019re considering ways to monetize that value at a faster pace.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ward Dickson. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. Looking at our segment EBITDA, the productivity initiatives we have in place are working to offset inflation and FX. Productivity and synergies drove $60 million in earnings improvement. FX was a negative $26 million headwind which \u2013 with much of that in Europe and Brazil. And the total impact of inflation of labor and commodities for the segments and corporate was $20 million. The change in labor and benefits was approximately $29 million, and there was $9 million of combined deflation in commodity and other cost categories. The total impact of price and mix changes was minimal in the quarter.","Corrugated packaging had positive price mix variance in part due to stable domestic box pricing, higher prices in Brazil, lower volumes of exports and domestic tons shipped, and an increase in the higher margin box shipments. There was a some decline in price and mix in the consumer packaging grades and specialty chemicals. Non-cash pension income was $26 million lower than last year due to, among other things, lower return on asset assumptions as we derisk our pension plans.","The nonrecurring amount of $29 million includes $23 million from last year\u2019s spare parts gains that didn\u2019t recur this year. We made significant progress during our first quarter as WestRock toward our $1 billion synergy and productivity improvement target. We entered the quarter at a run rate of $75 million in savings and exited at an annualized run rate in excess of $150 million, which exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. This is a significant objective that will take a lot of work over the next three years to capture.","Our entire organization is focused on meeting these objectives, and we have consistent monitoring and processes in place to make sure we stay on track, so we are confident in our ability to reach $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2018. We estimate that we will be at an annualized run rate of, at least, $400 million by the end of the fiscal year 2016. Our total SG&A costs for the quarter were $429 million, or 11% of sales. However, this total includes $64 million in ongoing merger and acquisition-related intangible amortization costs that flow through the $281 million depreciation and amortization line on our cash flow.","Excluding intangible amortization, our SG&A costs are running at 9.4% of sales and will trend lower as we execute on our synergy and performance improvement program. We have completed our work to allocate corporate costs to the appropriate business units all the way down to the costs in our level. The full cost allocation brings further visibility into spending and business unit profitability.","When comparing legacy RockTenn and MWV approximately 70% of RockTenn\u2019s corporate costs were allocated to the business units, and MWV was approximately 30% allocated. There was also some geography changes in the allocation market at some legacy MWV manufacturing site costs for non-production activities in the amount of $18 million were moved from cost of goods sold to SG&A.","And as Steve said, we have included Slide 19 that provides a reconciliation of reported to recast segment income and EBITDA for Q4 FY14 for comparability purposes. We ended the quarter with $5.6 billion in reported debt, and included in that figure is approximately $340 million in fair value step-up to the market value of the legacy MWV data. The notional amount of what we owe under our debt obligations are approximately $5.3 billion.","Our balance sheet is in great shape as we have $3.4 billion in available liquidity to support our strategy and very few maturities over the next several years. Our leverage ratio ended the quarter at 2.08 times. Our pension plans are in great shape, and we ended the fiscal year with almost $400 million in combined GAAP funded status surplus in our qualified U.S. and Canadian pension plans. The U.S. plans were overfunded by more than $500 million, and the Canadian plans were underfunded by more than $100 million. The overfunding in the U.S. plans gives us options as we think about derisking our balance sheet.","Slide #13 has a number of key financial items to help in modeling our performance. Depreciation and amortization will continue to be approximately $285 million on a quarterly basis, and of that total intangibles amortization is approximately $70 million. Our CapEx is still estimated at $850 million for the full-year. The pension income of $8 million represents both the qualified and non-qualified plan amounts. Our book tax rate should be in the range of 33% to 35% for the December quarter.","The September quarter effective tax rate of 29% was lower than our forecast due to discrete items primarily at the state tax level. We\u2019re planning scheduled maintenance downtime within our corrugated mill system of 114,000 tons during the quarter. Other items incorporated in our tax position also included $21.5 million of non-tax deductible restructuring fees.","Cash pension contributions into our qualified pension plans are approximately $37 million in fiscal 2016, with almost all of that going into our Canadian plans. Our non-qualified or surplans will require additional cash funding of approximately $13 million this fiscal year. We have $115 million in state, federal, and foreign NOLs and $213 million in AMT and other federal credits.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. Looking to the immediate future there is a number of items that will impact our performance in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We\u2019ll see benefits from our performance improvement initiatives in our domestic box and folding carton businesses continue to do well compared to the market. Energy prices are lower, which is a positive for us. There is three less shipping days this quarter, and the December quarter historically has lower seasonal sales volumes than the September quarter.","Maintenance and economic downtime will have a negative earnings impact. The euro and Brazilian real have both softened from September averages, and we expect to return to normal tax rates. Considering all of these items in the quarter, we expect sales and earnings to be lower in the December quarter as compared to last quarter.","Looking further out, WestRock aspires to be the global leader in corrugated and consumer packaging. The first step for WestRock to achieve this aspiration is to combine and integrate organizations and in the process to capture $1 million in merger-related efficiencies and productivity improvements. We\u2019re on the road to capture this opportunity over the next three years. We\u2019ve made a lot of good progress in our business in just four months. We\u2019ve made progress building our culture at WestRock, progress making our operations more efficient, and more importantly progress teaming with our packaging customers to grow their share in the marketplace.","While paper and packaging are very attractive businesses, the global economy, a strong U.S. dollar, and intense competition challenge us across our businesses. We are responding to these challenges with urgency, both to deliver short-term results, but also to keep our eye on the long-term opportunity we have within our sites. I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities that are ahead of us, and believe we\u2019re making excellent progress in the long-term value accretion opportunities we have as WestRock.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Jim, Bob, Ward, and I are now ready to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","George Staphos","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. My two questions are going to center around consumer. I guess, the first question I had broadly, is there a way to quantify what kind of benefit you expect to get from the insourcing of Carolina? And for that matter the integration benefit you mentioned in cartons I think is something to the tune of 50,000 tons, and how that will begin to play out in the quarters?","Steve Voorhees","The integration of Carolina, we\u2019re going to begin producing those as rapidly as we can. We think we\u2019ll be up by the end of the December quarter. So right now we\u2019re at a run rate of 180,000 tons. So you take the incremental benefit of that times incremental margin and this can really speak to pricing and margin with respect to that. And it\u2019s pretty much the same song second verse on the folding carton business. I think, we have integrated that. I think in October, we, in fact, integrated 4,000 to 5,000 tons into our system already. So we\u2019re well on our way to the 50,000 tons which we said in the comments, we\u2019ll be at 50,000 tons by the end of December.","George Staphos","Steve, just point of clarification, I missed this. Are you currently at the 50,000 tons run rate right now, or are you going to there by the end of the quarter?","Steve Voorhees","We said we would be there by the end of the quarter. I saw some information in October, I think we\u2019re just about there now. But now is close to the end of the quarter.","George Staphos","Okay. Second question again around consumer, a couple of parts to it. With carton volumes up and merchandising strong certainly versus our model, do you think that we\u2019re finally seeing the pick-up in the consumer we\u2019ve been waiting for, it seems like for a long time. And related if you can, do you have any shipment statistics for all of the boxboard grades within consumer? Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","We don\u2019t have the shipment statistics for the boxboard kind of grades currently at hand. I think we\u2019re looking at it through a higher disclosure work, I think it\u2019s just open as to what it would provide those in the future.","As far as trends in the market, it\u2019s hard to talk about a turnaround, but our volumes have been very strong in folding as we said. And on display, I think, we have seen a noticeable pick up in promotional activity from many of our customers. I think that has been noticeable and that has helped us drive the results that we\u2019ve talked about in this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the lie of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. A couple of questions on the containerboard side. The first thing, I appreciate the details on the decisions you made on the footprint. There was a little bit of confusion there. I realize is that the reports were coming from the media, and so again the clarification from you is very helpful. But people were a little bit uncertain as to why the two mills they were \u2013 at least, through the media it was conveyed as indefinite closures and then fairly quickly that the mills were back on. And the outside view is that it\u2019s fairly unusual and maybe that\u2019s just not understanding how you guys typically convey information, et cetera. But if there\u2019s anything you can do to kind of clarify what was going on, that would be helpful.","Steve Voorhees","Okay. So I\u2019m going to let Jim Porter respond to that.","James Porter","Good morning, Mark. First of all, we have a large system with 16 mills now. and we operate that system very focused on providing our customers with good service, on-time delivery, and superior products, while balancing our supply with demand. And so we\u2019re constantly in a situation of designing the optimal portfolio and production capacity to meet that demand. And with the addition of the SP Fiber acquisition, which we were delighted to close October 1, gave us the opportunity to really reassess our containerboard system and to make some important moves utilizing those excellent assets at Dublin to better optimize our supply capability to our customers and improve our cost structure.","So we were able to immediately take some capacity \u2013 production capacity out with the indefinite idling of the Fernandina Beach paper machine 3 and the Uncasville facilities, followed quickly by the announcement of the permanent closure of the Coshocton mill, which takes sometime to properly close in order to provide an orderly shutdown and to optimally consume chemicals, raw materials, fiber, wood, et cetera. And we also then followed that same week with the indefinite idling of the Newberg facility because of the weakness of the newsprint markets and to again balance our supply\/demand scenario.","So all of those decisions were executed to improve our capability to serve our customers and to improve our cost structure. We now are able to bring back the Fernandina Beach facility, which is an excellent paper machine producing high-quality virgin containerboard for our domestic and international markets. And the Uncasville recycled mill will also return. So that\u2019s \u2013 we operated that balancing in a way that supported our customers well and improved our cost structure, and that\u2019s the types of activities you\u2019ll see us focusing on in the future.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. And so am I right to interpret that? So the initial moves were on the indefinite closure on the two facilities, which then were restarted. It was a fluid situation and it depended on what was happening with some of the other facilities had an influence on what the status of those initial moves were ultimately going to be?","James Porter","Exactly. As I shared we\u2019re always in a position of balancing supply\/demand through a combination of maintenance and capital downtimes that you will see we reported in this last quarter we only had 3,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the September quarter, whereas in the prior quarter, it was a little over 100,000 tons of maintenance downtime. And we\u2019ve just shared than in the December quarter we\u2019ll have 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime.","So you can see within our system the balancing of capacity with demand is one in which we use the levers of maintenance downtime, flowbacks on certain paper machines, and the indefinite idling of others and in some cases permanent idling. But we have 16 mills that are operated in a way that we manage those paper machines production to demand.","Steve Voorhees","And Mark, the English language is a kind of just the English language and people interpret the same words differently. I think when we say indefinite we just mean not definite. And because we really don\u2019t want to create expectations that are \u2013 we don\u2019t want to create unnecessary expectations. So when we said indefinite, I think we\u2019ve had a meaning, which I think just was not \u2013 was picked up differently than, at least, the communication that we had. But I think Jim has covered the logic. And I think that\u2019s about all we can say on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Chi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Chi","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning, yes.","Alex Chi","Couple of questions. So just looking at the North American containerboard segment, you actually provided specific earnings numbers for that segment as part of corrugated. And as I look at the September quarter, it didn\u2019t show the improvement that we saw in the first three quarters of the fiscal year. And I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s anything else in the number that resulted in that. I know it had a really good year, so was there some incremental incentive compensation that was paid out at the mill and converting level, or and anything else that maybe was in this quarter that didn\u2019t show up in the previous ones?","Ward Dickson","We did have some sequential increases from Q3 to Q4 and our fiber costs have been moderating. So on a year-over-year basis, we certainly were having dramatic benefits and reduced OCC, and they actually increased sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And we sold fewer tons.","Alex Chi","Right. And just on that question around the tons and also demand, so your box shipments are up 3%, which is the majority of the tons. You said your exports were down to get the number in the 30s, but that would sort of imply a very material drop off in tons to domestic customers. Can you talk to that a little bit and what\u2019s happening there?","And then just as a follow-on on demand, you said October shipments were up 3% this year. Can you say what October was up last year, the genesis is being, I mean, are you putting up 3% on top of really good growth from last year? And I will stop here and turn it over. Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","I will let Jim talk about the domestic paperboard transition. But the box business has been performing very well on a volumetric basis for the past year. What October was up, I just don\u2019t have that number in my head. I think, John, can get it for you after the call. But we\u2019ve had very consistent, I think, strong volume growth in the box business for low at the strong execution by that team in the marketplace.","James Porter","Yes So the question was what was the mix of our business in the quarter? I\u2019m not quite sure exactly the question. You mentioned export shipments being down. Yes, in that quarter, they were down 29,000 tons. And yet internally with \u2013 due to our stronger corrugated box shipments, we had greater containerboard flowing through our internal channel. And, yes, a somewhat lower shipment to our domestic customer market and a slight increase in inventory. But the balance within our system is one in which we constantly look at our three channels, internal corrugated, external domestic, external international, and that\u2019s how we manage the system. So I\u2019m not sure if that answered specifically your question.","Steve Voorhees","Yes, just a question this quarter, I think, Alex looked like he was looking for the reduction of our domestic shipments quarter-over-quarter, that\u2019s approximately 60,000 tons exactly.","James Porter","Yes, 29,000 down export, 59,000 domestic, up in our internal channel in the mid-30,000s.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Josephson","Jim, just a couple for you. Just back to exports for a second, on the last call you talked about seeing strong kraft linerboard markets around the world and you talked about export prices firming, and your exports, I believe are up a 11% year-over-year. Obviously this call you\u2019ve talked about exports being down from a year ago and prices being down both sequentially and from a year ago. So can you just help us understand what changed in the quarter with respect to export volumes and prices?","James Porter","Global demand continues to be solid. We really see across all of the global markets demand is there. The impact of currency, however, has been pretty radical. And I certainly would not have forecasted the significant movements in the global currencies and the impact on price, which gives us the challenge of choosing where we \u2013 which markets of the world that we operate in. And fortunately, we have a broad portfolio of customers in North America and across the globe to be able to serve. And you\u2019ve seen us making those decisions in this past quarter accordingly.","Adam Josephson","Got it. Jim, thanks for that. And just not to beat a dead horse here, but in terms of what happened in October, have you previously taken either recycled mills or kraft linerboard machines down for just a couple of weeks in this case? It just seemed from the outside to be a very short time to take those mills\/machines down. But obviously we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on internally. Was it at all demand related or was it just \u2013 is that typical for you to do to take machines down for just a couple of weeks in this case?","James Porter","Absolutely. We\u2019ve been operating for the past several years matching supply with demand. And we\u2019ve got a great containerboard system and a wonderful portfolio of customers, but we have more installed capacities than our customer base. And so we\u2019re always optimizing our production capacity to meet demand. And you\u2019ve seen us indefinitely idle a number of our paper machines both version and recycled. And we are always operating in a mode, in some cases, we\u2019re slowing assets back. So this frankly was a very usual type of behavior, particularly in a quarter where we have very low maintenance and capital-related downtime.","Adam Josephson","Jim, and just one last one, can you talk about what the cost of market downtime is for the company and how you calculate that cost, and separately what the cost of the Coshocton closure will be? And thank you very much.","Steve Voorhees","Okay, just with respect to the cost of downtime, there is all sorts of different ways to look at it. I think if you are looking at the impact on our financial statements and you want to model something, I think using something in the range of $120 to $150 per ton should do it. I don\u2019t have the cash cost of the Coshocton closure. I just don\u2019t have it in my head.","James Porter","I don\u2019t either. The benefit is approximately $33 million in reduced cost, and the capital avoidance impact, which on average is approximately $4 million a year.","Steve Voorhees","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Scott Gaffner","Good morning. Just following up on the export shipments for the corrugated business, if I heard you correctly, it sounded as if you pulled back on exports not because of demand, but more because of price realization in the export markets. And if so which markets did you end up pulling back on specifically?","James Porter","The global markets are ones, as in all markets in which there is a range of pricing in each of those markets in the world and we make decisions to serve our customers and maximize our profitability. So there is really no specific market that we avoided. We just optimized our mix. We really don\u2019t share specificity relative to those issues.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. But the demand was there, you just chose to serve certain markets versus others. Correct?","James Porter","Well, each of the economies of the world certainly have their own demand variation. But in total the global demand for North American virgin containerboard, virgin containerboard period, remains quite solid. And we constantly try to optimize our mix through the three channels that we sell to.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. If I look at the $150 million of run rate synergy realization that you had in the quarter, I mean, it\u2019s exactly what you said you were going to do, you went out, you did it. But anything in there within the $150 million that sort of surprised you to the upside, and anything to the downside as you work through the integration synergy realization process?","Ward Dickson","Hey, Adam, this is Ward. I think we are pleased with our progress so far. If you look at the profile, as we talked about on the call last quarter, we entered the quarter with a $75 million run rate. We\u2019re clearly getting the benefits related to consolidation of some of the corporate overhead pools. I would say that we\u2019ve achieved about $50 million of the $100 million that we originally anticipated in the merger-related synergies. And then I think we\u2019re off to a very good start, both in the procurement organization and then some of the internalization discussions that we had across both the mills and our packaging organization.","So we were \u2013 if I gave you a number we were right around $165 million is what we achieved in the quarter. I mean, that was the annualized exit rate that we achieved. And as we talked about, we\u2019re tracking it project by project. And now that we have P&Ls at the plant basis across the whole company. We\u2019re now building the linkages between the synergy projects and the plant P&Ls to make sure that we\u2019re actually realizing the benefits through the \u2013 through our earnings.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is now open.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. I had a follow up on the corrugated business and specifically Brazil. I was wondering how much Rigesa exported in the quarter and maybe what percentage of production you can export from Brazil? And then does Rigesa compete in the same export markets as your North American system, or do you just talk about how those two systems meet each other in the global market?","James Porter","We \u2013 good morning, Anthony. We can assume within the Brazilian corrugated system approximately 80,000 tons a quarter. And we sell domestically and export approximately 40,000 tons a quarter. And the balance of Brazilian domestic sales and export is split pretty evenly. Now at the present time because of the currency related impact of the Brazilian real, we are biasing towards international shipments to gain that favorable advantage. And much of that is in continent, within South America, but there is some that goes into the European markets. And we do look at that in relation to the \u2013 our broader international sales from our North American containerboard business so..","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then in past quarters you\u2019ve given us updates on the inflation of EVOL in the U.S. And I was just wondering if you could give us an update there and just generally on the box plan optimization activities that\u2019s going on and kind of the legacy RockTenn containerboard system?","Steve Voorhees","Sure. We\u2019re in the process of installing EVOL number 16 and 17 out of 30. So we\u2019re just implementing the program that we talked about. We just chose not to mention it just because we already had a lot of content in the call. The box plant system, the team is working I think exceptionally well and they are delivering great results. Bob, do you have anything to add?","Bob Beckler","Yes, not much to add to that, Steve. I just think it\u2019s the combination of both really terrific commercial execution in the box business in North America. As you mentioned in your prepared comments, the retention of customers has improved dramatically over the last year with just a focus on operating fundamentals around quality, service, and reliability while we\u2019re building a more robust pipeline. So it\u2019s very gratifying that the business continues to outpace the industry, as it has over the last year. And just really rigorous a focus on productivity and synergy at the operating level, and the EVOLs are a part of the story, but just a lot of blocking and tackling going on in that business that\u2019s leading to really great and improved results at the converting level.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Philip Ng","Hey, good morning, guys.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning, Phi","Philip Ng","The 114,000 tons of maintenance downtime you\u2019re taking in corrugated in the first quarter, how much of that is a pull forward? And can you give us a sense of what the cadence is going to be for the rest of the year? And also assuming demand and pricing essentially holds, are you pretty much back to the balance level and can you kind of frame what kind of economic downtime you plan to take going forward? Thanks.","James Porter","Well, first, we don\u2019t comment on economic downtime going forward. We\u2019ve shared that in the October month, we took approximately 55,000 tons of economic downtime, however, I can\u2019t comment going forward. Relative to the 114,000 and the December quarter, I think you used the word pull-up. I would not characterize there as being any pull up that maintenance capital outage downtime schedule is one which we build frankly years in advance to try to hit the cycles of recovery, boiler rebuilds, and the necessary inspections and maintenance regime we needed to execute our business. And that volume is I think would be usual.","Relative to the go forward, we would have somewhat less volume than the 114,000 in the next quarter, approximately the same in the third, and very little in our fourth quarter would be the normal cadence for our business. To your question on supply with demand, yes we are matched with supply with demand and it\u2019s something we plan for constantly. And the decisions we make are all focused on supplying our customers in the most efficient manner.","Philip Ng","Okay. I guess a question for Ward. The buyback you guys did there in quarter, I think it was a little north of $300 million. Is that kind of a good run rate going forward? I know you\u2019re below your leverage target \u2013 or was it more being more opportunistic with the pull back in the market? Thanks.","Ward Dickson","Sure. As you look at the leverage target had the SP Fiber acquisition closed in the last week of the quarter rather than in the first week, we would have been at a pro forma leverage ratio of 2.2 times just on the \u2013 just shy of the low-end of our targeted range. I think Steve mentioned in his comments that we did \u2013 we\u2019ve got to make sure that we retained the continuity of interest to preserve the tax-free spend. So we\u2019ve had to actually track the common shareholders at a fund level. That did constrain us to a bit as we were in the quarter, but we did buy back over 5 million shares in the quarter. I think we\u2019ve been consistent about executing against our leverage ratio. I don\u2019t think we are tied to the absolute target on any \u2013 at any quarter. But I think our actions have been pretty consistent with the capital allocation strategy that we described at the announcement of the merger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Thanks and good morning, Steve and Ward. First question \u2013 and Jim. First question \u2013 and Bob, actually is on the depreciation and amortization, does that include the $285 million run rate, does that include chemicals, or is that taken out?","Steve Voorhees","That does include chemicals.","Chip Dillon","Okay. So that will stay there until the spin actually occurs?","Steve Voorhees","That\u2019s correct.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And then you\u2019ve mentioned the cost that Coshocton was running, that sort of implies that either you were losing money there or is that a fair statement, or at least you weren\u2019t really getting much contribution, I guess, in recent months from that mill?","Steve Voorhees","I don\u2019t think that we can go over that with you, but it was doing fine.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Gotcha. Okay. And then looking at Newberg, I know that the one machine there that was converted to packaging papers, I guess, loosely defined was not that long ago, I think in March. I understood the machine had about 200,000 tons of capacity. And could you sort of give us an idea of how much of that machine was running medium versus bag paper and other things?","James Porter","The mix of business on that machine was pretty evenly split between bag and containerboard and it \u2013 but it certainly was not full, geat paper machine. Both of those machines really have excellent potential and capability and make a wonderful product. But it \u2013 we just don\u2019t need those machines at the present time within our supply\/demand balance scenario.","Chip Dillon","Gotcha. That\u2019s clear. And I guess lastly, when you look at the \u2013 let\u2019s say the capacity \u2013 actually I think that covers it for me. Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","Okay. Thanks, Chip.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from DA Davidson. Your line is now open.","Steve Chercover","Thank you. So it\u2019s good to see that your North American containerboard margins are now north of 20%. However, they are still below that of some of your major competitors. And I\u2019m wondering can that gap be closed with investment, or is it something structural or pertaining to the furnish that you use?","James Porter","We work hard on it every single day. And it\u2019s a combination of the types of things that we\u2019ve been discussing relative to getting our portfolio of assets structured in the lowest cost manner. It\u2019s channel optimization of our customer portfolio across the world and it\u2019s business improvement and operating efficiency enhancement. Literally thousands of things that our team is constantly working on. And we\u2019ve got a nice portfolio on the table currently that we\u2019re looking forward to delivering on. And over time I would see that gap closing.","Steve Chercover","But it\u2019s fair to say that improvement in North American containerboard is not really something that we would put into the synergy bucket, correct?","Steve Voorhees","Generally not. I think there would be some areas to where you would have synergies. We have better scale for providing corporate services. We have better scale for procurement. But just on the direct, we\u2019re not adding North American containerboard assets as a result of the merger. So we don\u2019t expect to improve.","I would just add on to Jim\u2019s comments of \u2013 it\u2019s a competitive business. We can only improve our system. I think we have very good opportunities to improve our system, and that was incorporated when we came up with our productivity target. And I feel very good about the team we have working on that and our ability to improve the results in the North American corrugated business. How that translates into our GAAP, I can\u2019t really respond to that.","Steve Chercover","Okay. And sorry if I\u2019m somehow missing this, but can you clarify how open market purchases of your equity have any implications for the ratio of RockTenn and MeadWestvaco ownership?","Steve Voorhees","Yes, one of the things that we are trying to put and make sure that we preserve is the tax-free nature of the spin. And there is the continuity of ownership that we maintain the 50.1% through the period of the spin. So we actually had to go down to a fund level and identify those owners that were common share owners on July 1. And that\u2019s the opportunity set for the amount of shares that we\u2019ve been able to repurchase.","Steve Chercover","Yes. And I understand the importance of maintaining the tax structure. So you actually have to go to the fund level to say \u2013 to see whose shares you\u2019re buying?","Steve Voorhees","No, no, whose shares owned both MWV on July 1. And one of the elements that we are doing \u2013 we did file a PLR, a private letter ruling request with the IRS about the spin of specialty chemicals. And this is one of the items that we are trying to get a ruling from the IRS that will give us more freedom as we move forward.","Steve Chercover","But presumably after March 1, you can just go guns a blazing, right?","Steve Voorhees","Yes. And we believe that we have a \u2013 right now we have a capacity of about 10 million shares that we can feel even before we get a ruling from the IRS that we have the ability to buy back.","Steve Chercover","Very good. Thanks for taking my questions.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Manuel","Maybe wanted to \u2013 maybe come back to the SP Fiber stuff for a second. So I have a question around it and I do have a follow-up. But with the SP stuff, could you maybe give us a sense -- I think you paid a little under $300 million for it, but what exactly you bought? You have \u2013 there were two locations. What did you have in mills, what was capacity and such there? And then along those lines as well, what may have changed with dynamics between the time you announced things in August until we got to October that perhaps it sounds like, I think, my understanding is the majority of it or the bulk of the mills are closed.","James Porter","Chris, we\u2019re really delighted with the purchase of SP Fiber. And what we bought were four big, wide, fast, low-cost paper machines. And it gives us lots of optionality in the production of containerboard grades as well as lightweight kraft bag, et cetera. And so we\u2019re really quite pleased with having those assets, particularly Dublin. The Dublin mill, extremely well laid out, very efficient, lot of upside potential for further improvement in their cost structure by operating it as a part of our larger containerboard system. So we just see exceptional opportunity.","The Newberg mill all along with the newsprint production at that mill was one in which we were \u2013 we knew would be challenging. In the newsprint market, I think, you all understand as well as we do it is on a continuing decline. So what we have in newsprint in Newberg is the optionality on these two excellent big, wide, fast paper machines that give us the opportunity to consider what future needs may be for those assets. But currently we are indefinitely idling them and that improves the cash flow of the acquisition and the earnings from that case.","Chris Manuel","Maybe some clarification there. What was the capacity on each of those, the newsprint machines and then the stuff in Dublin?","James Porter","It depends on what grades you run them on. But round numbers, you could make up to 300,000 tons a piece on each of those machines depending upon what products they are producing.","Chris Manuel","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question was during the quarter, we had a transaction in the chemical space with Arizona that probably gives us a reasonable look at as packaging analysts and not primarily chemicals analysts, or a reasonable read as to what a multiple might look like for Ingevity. Why or why not might that be a reasonable thing to think about or not?","Steve Voorhees","Yes, Bob, do you want?","Bob Beckler","Yes. So, Chris, this is Bob Beckler. Yes, I think you are right in that, it\u2019s a data point. But you really have to look at Ingevity in the broader specialty chemical space. And there has just been widespread of valuations in that space that are generally still very, very attractive. While we do compete in the space that Arizona Chemical participates in on pine chemicals, I would say, we fly at a higher level in terms of targeting premium applications for pine chemicals and derivatives.","For example, the pavement technologies or asphalt emulsifiers that we have in that business, which Arizona largely does not have, are very attractive and performed extremely well, record sales in the last quarter. So it is a data point, but I would say there is also a lot of apples and oranges. So I wouldn\u2019t take it too literally.","Chris Manuel","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Steve Voorhees","Debbie?","Debbie Jones","Hi, there. Good morning. I wanted to talk about the home health and beauty business. It doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention on these calls, but you talked I think last quarter about some investment to meet customer needs. Can you just kind of elaborate on whether that is to kind of grow volumes, what you are kind of expecting in that business? And then also how core is this business to you?","Steve Voorhees","Bob?","Bob Beckler","Hi, Debbie, it\u2019s Bob Beckler again. And thanks for giving a little attention to what is really a great business in the packaging portfolio. Steve mentioned in his prepared comments, it had a terrific quarter, and they continue to build on this track record of improvement that you have seen in the business over the last two years now, which has come from a combination of things. It\u2019s been a better commercial strategy targeting more attractive niches in the global market, better plant loadings and better productivity. And we have made incremental investments in that business that are required to support our customers, our partners with their particular rollouts.","So it\u2019s all working together and continues to show a very positive trend. In terms of the fit, question we like it for three reasons. One is the overlap that the home health and beauty dispensing system business has with our other paper and packaging businesses. Roughly $1 million \u2013 $1 billion of WestRock sales are to customers that buy dispenser products and other paperboard and packaging products from WestRock. We also have really strong relationships with these customers through the dispensing system business, because it\u2019s a highly technical and innovative business.","And so these are more like partnerships, which then we can leverage with our other packaging businesses. And then finally it\u2019s a global business, which gives us the opportunity to reach beyond the North American orders. So we still feel very good about the fit and the performance of that business.","Debbie Jones","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. If I could one final question, you mentioned earlier you don\u2019t make the public announcements on your idle mills. And I appreciate these are difficult decisions, but can you help us understand going forward, does it make sense for you when you\u2019re managing supply with demand to idle mills for a short duration, or is this primarily just kind of related to the inclusion of Dublin in your system?","James Porter","The \u2013 I think as we\u2019ve shared, Debbie, that the levers that we have to balance supply with demand and demand varies, right? It depends upon our North American corrugated packaging business, global demand, et cetera. So we have to be flexible in the large system we operate between maintenance and capital downtime, idling, and slowback. So you\u2019ll see us operating that flexibility in a way that we think is the optimal way to supply our customers at the lowest cost.","Debbie Jones","Okay.","James Porter","So short answer you will see us continuing to use those levers going forward.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.","Mark Wilde","Good morning.","Steve Voorhees","Hello, Mark.","Mark Wilde","Steve, I wondered if we could just kind of take a step back for a minute. For those of us who have been covering the company for a long time, we recall that Smurfit-Stone was a pretty choppy ride for the first 12 months of that deal. Anything you\u2019re trying to do differently this time?","Steve Voorhees","That\u2019s a great question. I think, yes. But they are very different situations. Smurfit was literally an acquisition. This is a merger and it\u2019s a great that it\u2019s a merger, because one of the big issues we had in Smurfit I\u2019m going to put into the category of culture that we were integrating into our organization. At the time I was CFO. My job tripled overnight and then the Smurfit organization had not just been successful over a long period of time. And that continues to be a lesson for me of how that can really impact a culture.","This merger is very much different, because I think most of the people on the call would have known both companies and WestRock\u2019s bringing the best of both companies to the table. We\u2019re highly complementary. I think you could pro forma either company, and I guess we are trying to pro forma both companies going forward. And we\u2019ve got a tremendous future together, which is better than either company would have on its own. So depending on which side you\u2019re on we can go through and then write the opportunities. But we effectively, from a culture standpoint, we\u2019ve put a much greater emphasis on that.","And so we\u2019re moving beyond. This is a merger of two companies that it\u2019s a creation of a new company which is WestRock and we\u2019re working together. I\u2019m very optimistic about the future of the company and I think on \u2013 in the call, I think, we focused a lot on a very discrete set of actions we took, which I think were misinterpreted by the business. But underlying that, I think, we are performing at an exceptional level, that we\u2019re delivering the merger and performance improvements.","Somebody asked about is there \u2013 was there a surprise, and I would like to think that there is an expectation we\u2019re going to go out and get that. But we are meeting that expectation I\u2019d say with enthusiasm across the organization. And that\u2019s going to end up what we need to do that to be successful. While all that is going on, we have, I think, each one of our businesses on a day-to-day basis is operating exceptionally well.","I\u2019m very excited about the reaction we\u2019re getting from the customers. They are coming to us and asking us what can \u2013 what\u2019s this about and we\u2019re having conversation, it\u2019s a little bit early to tell what the ultimate tale to tape is. But I think it\u2019s going to position us to be a remarkably successful company going forward. So thank you for the opportunity, Mark.","Mark Wilde","All right, that\u2019s helpful. Listen, I have just as a follow on, a couple of questions around pricing and volume. You had flagged $17 million of pricing weakness in consumer packaging. And then over in pine chemicals you had talked about both pricing and volume pressure from petrochemical-based alternatives. And I wondered if you could just provide a little color on both of those?","Bob Beckler","Hi, Mark, it\u2019s Bob. Let me start with specialty chemicals and then we can come back to consumer packaging. I think, as you know having called the business the specialty chemical business that will become Ingevity is a highly flexible business around its refinery system. And oilfield technologies has definitely seen the impact of what\u2019s happening in the broader sector. But let me give you a couple of statistics to put it in perspective.","So well count \u2013 oil well counts are down about 65% across the industry year-on-year, yet our revenue in that specific sector is only down about 40%. So we\u2019re actually taking share in a down market in oilfield, which is a market that we really like for its profitability and that\u2019s because we just have really great highly differentiated products. And at the same time we were able to shift business over into industrial specialties. Yes, there has been some pricing movement with the dislocations that are occurring and a very modest offset in volume. But as I said earlier and one of my answer is, we\u2019re able to move into some other areas that help offset that volume decline. And asphalt pavement technologies has been an example of that, up 19% versus prior year.","So a lot a big movements in the business. But really great effort by the team in managing through what has been a fairly volatile period of time. And I think it will position them well for the future. Mark, can you repeat your question on consumer?","Mark Wilde","Yes. You had flagged $17 million of pricing weakness in consumer packaging. So just trying to understand where that is. We\u2019ve all heard some reports about sort of weakness in international SBS markets. I\u2019m just trying to understand whether that\u2019s the whole story there or whether you are seeing it in some other markets?","Bob Beckler","Yes, Mark. Well, I think it\u2019s both the paperboard and converting answer to your question. We have definitely seen the FX impact to the downside on both revenue and translation back at the profitability. With paperboard exports less so on the converting siding with the exception of our beverage business, which our beverage multi-pack business is about 50% outside of North America. And so there has been some FX exposure there as well.","On the converting side, overall if you step back, we are really pleased with how we are performing in our markets. Our volumes are up. We\u2019re managing well in terms of mix and pipeline development with customers. And so overall, I think, the converting side of consumer solutions is performing well. Anything, Jim, you would add on the paperboard side?","James Porter","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think we like the positions we\u2019re in with respect to our specialty products that supply the high-end initiatives of the paperboard markets in North America and globally. We do feel some pressure from FX, which we\u2019re all aware of, but fundamentally the business is operating extremely well and we have a product portfolio that\u2019s in demand and we like our position.","Mark Wilde","All right. You\u2019ve got an excellent system. So I just that, if I can kind of read through this, it sounds like that $17 million is mostly on the mill side and it probably skews to the kind of the international trade component of the business. Is that correct?","James Porter","It\u2019s a good assumption. I think it\u2019s somewhat balanced between our \u2013 it\u2019s largely international sales across the portfolio of converted products.","Steve Voorhees","So, Mark, we\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019m not \u2013 we need to provide a better answer. We will do that in the Q that we file.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful, Steve.","Steve Voorhees","I think rather than try to \u2013 I think that business has so many elements to it to try to isolate that specific price risk is a little bit difficult for us right now. So we\u2019ll include it in our Q, an explanation, so everybody will see that. Okay?","Mark Wilde","Fair enough. Thank you.","A - Steve Voorhees","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Operator I think we are complete with the call. Again, I want to express my appreciation for everybody taking their time to listen to the call. And we will speak to you next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"22805":["Westrock Company Inc.

My name is Kristin, I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Third Quarter FY15 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, slides are being presented today as part of the conference call. These slides can be accessed at www.westrock.com under the investor page. Ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, July 30. [Operator Instructions]","Your speakers for today's call are Mr. Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Ward Dickson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Voorhees, you may begin your conference.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning. Welcome to the first WestRock conference call. This is Steve Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer. I appreciate you investing your time to learn more about our new Company. I'm joined this morning by Ward Dickson, Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business; and Bob Beckler, President of our Packaging Solutions business.","During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs, related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our WestRock S-4 filing, and the most recent 10-K's and 10-Q's, followed by our predecessor Companies, RockTenn and MeadWestvaco.","We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.","Since we napped the merger in January, we've been working on integrating the predecessor organizations into WestRock. We have enthusiastic alignment across the Company about our aspiration to be the global, industry leader in consumer and Corrugated Packaging markets. And, we've made substantial progress in structuring our organization externally, with our customers and suppliers, and internally across our 275 operating and business locations around the world.","We've identified and organized ourselves to capture the synergies and performance improvements, that we have available to us from the merger, and also from the momentum both organizations had, going into the merger. We're very excited about the strength of our new Company and the opportunity to protect real value for our customers, stockholders and employees.","I feel good about the progress we're making to develop the WestRock culture. Of course, our success depends on delivering strong results. With that in mind, I'm turning to what we've done in the most recent quarter. Because the merger closed on July 1, we are not reporting consolidated WestRock results this quarter. We are reporting RockTenn's complete financial results for the June quarter.","We're also reporting net sales and segment income information from MeadWestvaco. We do not plan to report to complete financial results for MeadWestvaco for the June quarter. While I understand this may be of interest to the investment community, we've chosen not to maintain the administrative infrastructure, and incur the expense necessary to report MeadWestvaco's complete financial results.","The segment results show the detail regarding the current performance of our business. And, we're providing details about the combined results of both Companies in our new segment reporting structure. We have accomplished a tremendous amount since announcing the merge six months ago. And, I want to thank the WestRock team for maintaining our focus on serving our customers, and operating very efficiently, while at the same time working diligently on integration.","The financial results in the June quarter for each predecessor Company bears this out. RockTenn's adjusted EPS of $1.15 increased by 17% over last year. MWV segment income increased by 7%. Our combined segment income was up 10%. I'm particularly pleased with the strong returns in the WestRock Corrugated Packaging business in North America and Brazil. In our Consumer Packaging business, Folding Carton, Food & Beverage and Home, Health & Beauty all performed well.","We're delivering on the envisioned benefits of our combination. At the time we announced the merger, we committed to a $300 million merger-related synergy target that represented approximately 7% of the revenue of MWV packaging business. This was on top of the approximate $700 million in the ongoing contribution for programs we already had in place, to improve productivity through process improvement and capital investment. Going forward, we will track the total $1 billion synergy and performance improvement target.","The overall goal is more readily identifiable in our financial statements, and we'll avoid the non-value added effort of determining whether an individual action is merger or performance related. We expect to reach the billion dollar target before the impact of inflation, by the end of FY18. This represents approximately 7% of our total revenue, excluding the Specialty Chemicals business. By the end of this September quarter, we expect to be at a run rate of $150 million in merger-related synergies and performance improvements.","An additional benefit of the merger is the ability to combine the over-funded MWV pension plans with the under-funded RockTenn plans. During the first week of July, we merged our US qualified pension plans. And as a result, we will avoid over $550 million in future pension contributions, including $14 million that would have otherwise been contributed on July 15.","Our confidence in achieving our future cash flows, supports our stockholder return strategy that we announced on July 1. And, is comprised of $1.50 per share dividend and a 40 million share repurchase authorization, that we intend to use to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.25 times to 2.5 times. Our pro forma leverage at closing was right at 2 times.","WestRock will report our results in four business segments. Corrugated Packaging will generate approximately $2 billion in quarterly sales, and will include the RockTenn North American Corrugated Packaging business and Recycling business, and the MWV Brazilian and Indian Corrugated Packaging businesses. At $1.7 billion in quarterly sales, Consumer Packaging will include RockTenn's Consumer Packaging and Merchandising Displays business, and MWV's Food & Beverage and Home, Health & Beauty businesses. Specialty Chemicals and Land and Development will continue as separate segments.","Sales of our Corrugated Packaging business are approximately $8 billion per year, with the production of 8.5 million tons of a wide variety of paper brands. Of our 8 million tons of production in North America, our box plant system converts about 5 million tons per year, into corrugated packaging. The remaining 3 million tons are sold to independent corrugated converters in North America, and other international markets.","We've operated an integrated system in Brazil for over 60 years. In 2013, we completed a $500 million investment, including a new paper machine, to grow our corrugated packaging business. About 2\/3 of our approximate 500,000 tons of production is converted in our own box plants. I visited these operations last month and was very impressed with the quality of the assets, and the outstanding team we have in place there.","Turning to the results for the June quarter for our combined corrugated packaging segment, industry demand for corrugated packaging in the United States increased by 1.3%, as measured by daily box shipments, compared to last year. Exports grew by approximately 11%, compared to last year. We exported 316,000 pounds during the quarter, 30,000 tons more than both the March quarter, and last year's quarter. Industry operating rates continued to be solid in the 96% range. We delivered very strong result in North America, as measured by our 200 basis point EBITDA margin improvement, to 19.4%. The performance of our box plant system was a highlight of the quarter. Our volumes increased by 3.9% compared to last year. In July, we've maintained this performance. Box volumes are up 4% over last year.","We continue to benefit from the cumulative impact of many areas of improvement, executed by our team over the past four years, including quality and customer service. We're now halfway through the installation of 30 EVOL flexo-folder gluers. And, our results today have exceeded our exceeded our expectations. Overall, corrugated box pricing in North America was up 0.6%, as compared to the March quarter, and down 1.5% compared to last year.","Pricing of domestic containerboard increased about 1% on a sequential basis, and also increased about 1% as compared to last year. Average export pricing declined by 1% from the March quarter, and was down 8.5% compared to last year, due to the strength of the US dollar. Pricing for containerboard for export to Latin America remained stable. Linerboard continues to be tight, but we have taken some economic downtime in medium, to match our supply with our demand. During the June quarter, we took 104,000 tons of maintenance downtime, and less than 20,000 tons of economic downtime. We expect only 4,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the September quarter.","Our Recycling operation improved profitability during the quarter with segment income of $2.5 million, after a loss in the March quarter of $400,000. This was a result of rising recycle prices and a strong operational cost focus. Consistent with recycling's primary mission of sourcing high-quality fiber for our mills, in June, the recycling group started exporting 6,000 tons per month to our India mills. This has improved fiber quality and reduced our delivered cost.","Turning to Brazil, Economic conditions remain challenging. While industry demand declined by 2%, we delivered outstanding results with box volume growth of 15%, year over year. EBITDA margins of 28.7% were very strong, up 530 basis points compared to last year. We've seen gains with major national meat and produce customers, as well as growth in food oils and chemical markets. We were successful in raising prices to offset cost inflation.","The new containerboard machine in Brazil continues next to operate extremely well. June quarter shipments of 125,000 tons set a record, and were 7% higher than one year ago. We're integrating the North American containerboard export business with our export business in Brazil, to increase our efficiency and the value we can provide international customers.","Sales in our Consumer Packaging business are approximately $7 billion per year. Null production is approximately 4 million tons of a wide variety of paper grades. All of our null production is in North America. Our largest mill is Mahrt, Alabama, which produces over 1 million tons coated natural kraft. Our SBS system produces 2.1 million tons from mills in Covington, Virginia; Demopolis, Alabama; Evadale, Texas; and La Tuque, Quebec.","We serve markets with high quality requirements, including Food & Beverage, Tobacco and commercial print markets. The recent acquisition of the Carolina branded product line from International Paper improves our position in this attractive segment of the commercial print markets. Our recycled system includes nine mills producing 1 million tons of coated and uncoated recycled paper board. Our folding cartons system consists of 34 plants across North America and Europe, and generate sales of about $2 billion. The WestRock Consumer Packaging business includes our Home, Health & Beauty dispensing business, with approximately $600 million in sales.","The combination of our dispensing business with our paper packaging businesses provides a unique differentiated offering to these customers. And, we are fully exploring these opportunities with our customers, with very good success. Interestingly, the top four Home, Health & Beauty customers account for more than $150 million in sales, and these same customers purchased 500 million of corrugated boxes, folding cartons and displays, from WestRock.","Packaging has a very significant impact on our customer's success in their markets. The breadth, depth and scale of WestRock's Consumer and Corrugated Packaging solutions capabilities provides us with a unique opportunity to engage our customers, to work together with us, to help them be successful. Many of our customers are engaging with us on that very basis. I don't think any other company has the same opportunity. And, I'm optimistic about what I've seen so far. That I believe we are, and will be, able to provide perspective, products and services, that will support our customer's success and provide a runway of growth for WestRock.","Turning to the results for the Consumer Packaging segment. Overall industry null operating rates are stable, with CRB showing the greatest strength. Industry backlogs for CRB are 33% higher than last year, and our backlogs are approximately four weeks to five weeks. We've recently informed our customers of a $50 per ton price increase for CRB, effective next month.","Industry SBS backlogs have weakened since last year, and our system backlogs are at approximately three weeks to four weeks. After a good beverage season, demand for our coated natural kraft remained solid. And, backlogs are roughly four weeks to five weeks. The Food & Beverage business reported a 13% increase in income, on flat sales, and overcame currency headwinds that reduced sales by $22 million, and income by $5 million. Beverage sales reflected volume growth and share grains in global beer, that were offset by ongoing weakness in carbonated soft drink sales.","All major regions, including North America, Europe and Asia, contributed to our overall sales growth in beverage. Our food business, in the quarter, was mixed with ongoing weak demand in the US retail food markets. Despite this, we saw demand growth in food service, tobacco and selected retail food applications. During the quarter, we also began successfully on-boarding the Carolina business, and we'll transition to full production from International Paper at the end of the calendar year.","For the RockTenn Consumer Packaging system, sales were flat with last year, while income increased by 11%. EBITDA margins improved by 140 basis points, to 17.9%. Our converted volumes increased by 4% over the prior year, as we captured new business, leveraging the manufacturing capabilities in our folding carton system. Over the last 18 months, we've started up new processes at our Knoxville, Tennessee; Nicholasville, Kentucky; and Clinton Iowa plants.","Moving to our Merchandising Displays business. Industry demand for promotional displays is soft, driven by a number of factors, including the shift to the clean floor policy of a major retailer. Merchandising Displays sales declined by 13% compared to last year. While income declined compared to last year, income more than doubled compared to the March quarter. We're working to match our cost structure to our anticipated levels of business, through a number of actions, including streamlining our operations. And, have announced the closure of facilities in Tullahoma, Tennessee; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Lima, Ohio.","In the Home, Health & Beauty business income improved by 18%, on lower sales, continuing the productivity improvement trend that we've seen for the past several quarters. Sales declined by 12%, compared to the prior year. But, decreased only 4% on a constant currency basis. The negative currency translation impact was expected, as more than 30% of the sales are from Western Europe. The business executed very well commercially and operationally. We continue to gain volume in value-added segments, including fragrance and trigger sprayers.","Specialty Chemicals is a $1 billion business with EBITDA margins of over 25%. About 75% of the business produces performance chemicals, including asphalt additives, oil field chemicals and a variety of other products. The Performance Chemical business adapts its refining process to changing market demand. As an example, when demand for oil field chemicals has declined, we've been able to produce other products, including our asphalt additive products, to mitigate the impact of this change in market demand.","The activated carbon business accounts for 25% of the segment revenue, and has a very strong position in global automotive markets. The business has grown and sustained attractive profitability, based on its consistent ability to identify opportunities and bring value-added solutions to market. We've been investing to expand capacity in Specialty Chemicals. Capital expenditures have been $100 million over the past 12 months, which includes our estimate of ongoing maintenance capital needs of $35 million per year.","The most significant growth project has been in China, where we have invested in a Greenfield activated carbon plant that will increase our capacity to serve the global automotive market by 15%. This plant will help us maintain our leadership in activated carbon, which is expected to grow with new, more stringent, global automotive emission requirements being phased in over the next several years.","As much as we like the Specialty Chemicals business, it's not core to WestRock. And, we continue to work towards spinning this business off into a new Company called Ingevity. We're well into our CEO search, and expect to make an announcement in August. We intend to file the initial Form 10 in September. While we anticipate that we will be prepared to initiate the spin at the end of December, we are following guidance from our advisors that the best timing, from an equity capital markets perspective, will be to launch the spinoff to stockholders during the March quarter of 2016.","For the June quarter, Specialty Chemicals revenue declined 8%, but was down 4% on a currency adjusted basis. Currency headwinds impacted the top line by $11 million. The business had record sales of asphalt additives, and activated carbon, in the quarter, partially offsetting weakness in oil field chemicals and other markets.","Our patented warm mix paving solution, Evotherm, had strong performance in the US and Europe. Awareness of the performance and sustainability benefits of Evotherm continue to grow. The activated carbon business remains strong, with a growing portion of sales coming from higher-value solutions that address the more stringent automotive emission standards mandated by US regulatory agencies, that phase in beginning in 2017.","Segment EBITDA margins were 26.7%. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA margins were 27.9%. The business continues to perform exceptionally well.","WestRock Land and Development is our legacy land development business. Which, after entitling approximately 100,000 acres for development, selling over one million acres of timber and recreational land for over $2 billion, over the last eight years, has now focused on the value-added monetization of the remaining approximately 80,000 acres of development land. Primarily, located in and around Charleston, South Carolina.","Most of the projects are held in partnerships with Plum Creek Land Company, and others, and are managed by WestRock. Growth channel trends in the Charleston, South Carolina market are very positive. The Port of Charleston is growing. Boeing continues to expand its 787 manufacturing facility. Daimler-Benz is building a new $500 million Sprinter van manufacturing facility, which will employ 1,300 people. And, Volvo recently announced the construction of a $500 million manufacturing facility that will employ 2,000 people.","Last Friday, WestRock sold a 6,600 acre track for $34 million, for all Volvo's new manufacturing facility. It's nearby commercial and industrial land holdings and master plan communities, including Nexton and Summer's Corner, are well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing regional growth around Charleston. We expect these very favorable market dynamics to support the acceleration of development land sales over the next quarters. We're continuing to pursue the disciplined development of infrastructure, and facilities, necessary to match the increased demand for land from users, developers and home builders, at a pace that maximizes value for stockholders.","WestRock will generate significant cash flow that will be available to be reinvested in the business, or return to stockholders. We have and will focus on capital allocation. It's critical to our success. We expect to have a tract of opportunities to invest in our business. We've invested $1.8 billion in capital expenditures in our business, during the past two years, including $865 million during the past 12 months.","These investments include a new paper machine in Brazil, a new biomass boiler at our Covington, Virginia mill, a new wood yard in Florence, South Carolina, 15 new EVOL flexo-folder gluers in our box plant system and the new activated carbon plant in China. WestRock stockholders are the beneficiaries of these investments.","We've recently completed our capital budget for FY16. The capital budget processes included identifying projects through the multiple lenses of the market, our business strategy, the situation at individual locations. We've prioritized these projects by business and location, in light of the aggregate fit with our business strategy. We plan to invest approximately $850 million in capital, during FY16. We estimate maintenance capital to be $500 million. For the $350 million in return generating projects, we expect to return un-levered after-tax returns in the range of 20%.","The key return generating capital projects in the paper solutions business are the Demopolis biomass boiler, the rebuild of the bark boiler at Mahrt, the carbonate cook project at the Stevenson, Alabama mill and the evaporator upgrade at the West Point, Virginia mill. Key return generating projects within the packaging solutions group include, the installation of seven additional EVOL flexo-folder gluers in our box plants and three additional presses at our Folding Carton plants, along with the conversion of our plant in the Czech Republic from tobacco to beverage operations.","We will make other investments in beverage and Home, Health & Beauty, to respond to specific customer requirements. Of $850 million, about $35 million is for Specialty Chemicals in the December quarter, prior to spinoff. After investing the capital necessary to support and improve our business, WestRock will be able to return significant capital to stockholders. During the past 12 months, the combined companies paid $310 million in dividends, and bought 265 million of stock. We would have bought back more stock had we not been prevented from doing so, as a result of the merger.","We've increased the annual dividend rate to $1.50 per share, or $400 million. And, we are in a position to buy back up to 40 million shares of stock, to move to and maintain our target leverage ratio, that's in the range of 2.25 times to 2.5 times. I like the management team of the combined company. This group has come together extremely well. And, we're working together effectively to with our company forward.","As many of you know, our Corporate Management team including me, our Chief Financial, Accounting, Human Resource and Sustainability Officers, as well as our General Counsel, are all located in Norcross. Our Chief Communications and Chief Strategy Officer's will be relocating to Norcross.","We will continue to have a very significant presence in Richmond, which will be the location of our consumer paperboard, beverage, and Home, Health & Beauty businesses, as well as the center of our Research and Development functions for the entire company. And WestRock University, the center of our talent development activities.","The work that we've done on integrating the businesses, the work we've done on the dividend, share repurchases and the capital budget, the work we've done to put our organization in place, combined with the strong results we've posted for the June quarter, provide us with a firm foundation and momentum as we enter the first year of WestRock. I'll now turn the call over to Ward. And, I will come back after Ward's comments and wrap up the call. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. Slide 14 is the RockTenn segment income bridge for the June quarter. We had strong growth in segment income, with an increase of $32 million. The combination of price and mix was a negative $34 million, related primarily to the decline in export containerboard, and pulp pricing, over the last year. There has been some price and mix decline in box pricing over the last year, but only at approximately 1.5%.","Cost deflation continued to be a benefit during the quarter, with reductions on both recycled fiber and virgin fiber. Recycled fiber prices were down approximately 23% from last year. Our overall virgin fiber costs were down 3.8% from last year, from a combination of lower prices, capital investments and the implementation over the last two years of our new wood buying strategy. We continued to make strong productivity gains, generating $31 million in benefit in the quarter, with good momentum as we move to the $1 billion target for combined merger-related synergy and performance improvements.","D&A, a non-cash item, was $9 million unfavorable. Last year, we recognized a $9 million gain, recording previously unreported spare parts inventories. MWV segment income improved by $14 million over last year, despite the effects of currency. Cost deflation was a $12 million benefit, with gains in energy, fiber and chemicals. Ongoing productivity and margin improvement programs created $21 million in higher earnings, and provide a good platform for our current initiatives. Pension income was $13 million lower, on a quarterly basis.","Immediately after the merger announcement, we started on the integration, analysis and preparation. And, developed detailed plans for every synergy opportunity. We engaged outside advisers to help us in the certain areas. The billion dollar target includes both companies specific cost reduction and performance improvement targets of approximately $700 million, and the merger-related synergies target of $300 million.","Over one half of the $1 billion target will come from our ongoing productivity and performance improvement programs across our manufacturing footprint, and cost savings from capital investments. Almost 30% will be from procurement opportunities. And, the remainder will be from manufacturing optimization and reductions from the elimination of duplicate corporate costs and support functions. The billion dollar performance improvement savings will be realized at about a third over each of the next three years.","We expect to realize a run rate of a $150 million in savings by the end of September. The elimination of duplicate corporate expenses will be realized quickly. We have developed concrete plans behind each of these areas, and have pushed the savings goals down to each business and function. Everyone will be held accountable for realizing these targets. Total transaction related costs were approximately $115 million. And, the estimated cost for us to capture the merger-related synergies are approximately $100 million. We estimate 20% to 30% of this will be paid from pension plan assets.","I want to highlight that the billion dollars is before inflation. Labor benefits and insurance expense accounts for approximately $3.5 billion per year. And, normal inflation on this category should be approximately $100 million per year. The balance of our inflation will depend on commodity price trends, and could add another $125 million to $175 million in inflation per year. We will update the investment community on our progress against our target, as part of our quarterly results.","We bring a disciplined cost focus to the business and are instilling that view across 42,000 employees. We are currently rolling out allocations of the applicable corporate overhead cost to each business and cost center. And, we know from our past that it drives full accountability and visibility across the organization. By fully allocating costs, the businesses are able to challenge the corporate departments on their cost and spending. And, management can determine where the best returns and investments should be made, if at all.","Our post-merger balance sheet is very strong, as opening leverage is approximately 2 times, and our maturities are very well spaced out. Both S&P and Moody's reaffirmed their ratings on WestRock at investment grade. Our $4.9 billion bank financing package has attractive terms. And, combined with our other facilities, provides us with more than $3.5 billion of current available liquidity to execute, on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy.","With leverage at 2X and our stock price at these levels, we have an opportunity to move rather quickly, to increase our leverage toward our 2.25 times to 2.5 times leverage target. Our current debt mix is 62% fixed and 38% floating. Our combined average interest rate is about 4.7%. Our marginal cost to borrow on our available lines is less than 1.35%.","Before turning back to Steve, let me provide you an overview of some of the key assumptions that will help you in your modeling of our September quarter. Although our purchase price accounting work is not yet finalized, $270 million is our current estimate of depreciation and amortization for the quarter. Of that, approximately $70 million is quarterly intangible amortization expense, or $280 million on an annual basis. This will flow through our SG&A line, and should be considered when making comparisons of our SG&A expense, versus peers.","We will do everything we can to drive unnecessary costs out of our business. For example, we are actively working to sublease the entire New York Park Avenue office space, and will seek to set sublease currently available space in Richmond. We are evaluating other opportunities to sublease available space across our Company.","Effective with our July 2 pension plan merger, we are approximately 109% funded on a GAAP basis, in our US plans, and are embarking on a de-risking liability-driven pension investment strategy that is approximately 80% bonds. The corresponding expected return on the asset portfolio is 5.87%, which is reducing our forecasted pension income to about $8 million for the quarter. By moving immediately on merging the pensions plans, we saved $14 million in pension contributions, that would have been due on July 15.","We have provided a cost of goods sold breakout, which outlines our cost pools across our entire manufacturing footprint. In addition, we have provided 18 annual commodity consumption volumes to help you. The current estimated annual dollar spend across these eight categories is approximately $2.8 billion.","As we think about our exposure to foreign currencies, we look at our geographic revenue mix overall. Which is 79% North American and 21% outside of this region. Of this 21%, approximately half is comprised of exports of containerboard and paperboard, that are priced primarily in US dollars. The remainder is sold in local currency.","Our largest foreign currency exposures are related to the euro and the Brazilian Real. We estimate that he 10% strengthening of the dollar against these currencies would have a $30 million negative impact to EBT, on an annual basis. Back to you, Steve","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. Trends in most of our markets are stable to positive. This includes overall containerboard, paperboard and packaging markets. Raw materials prices are also relatively stable.","With respect to the outlook for the September quarter, we expect that the performance trends we have seen over the past quarter will continue. And that, our success in the quarter will be influenced by how we perform and maintain our momentum, including capturing the opportunities available to us as a result of the merger.","When we announced the merger on January 26, we said that, together, we are creating a global industry leader in consumer and corrugated packaging. A company with true competitive advantages, including an outstanding organization, a market focused customer centric strategy and scale. We said that we'd be leveraging the strengths of both companies into a larger, more balanced and more global, business that the combined company would have an enhanced presence in the marketplace that will provide substantial opportunities for profitable growth.","We said that we'd have the financial strength and flexibility to enable this growth. All that remains true six months later, in fact, after six months, I feel even better about this combination, WestRock, than I did in January. We have a strong foundation and a near-term road map to capture the billion in merger-related synergy and performance improvement opportunities, by the end of FY18. We are very focused on cash flow generation, overall.","Corrugated and Consumer Packaging are attractive businesses, where scale and differentiation matter. We offer a set of products, services and scale that can't be offered by any other company. This provides us the opportunity to grow. We have the cash flow available to invest for growth on a disciplined basis. And also, the ability to return the significant cash to stockholders, via dividends and share repurchases. I want to thank you for your time and interest.","We will now turn the call over for Q&A. Operator, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Sir, your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. And, thank you for that thorough overview of the new entities, very informative. What I was hoping to get was, first of all, any sense as to the pacing on the share repurchase? Or, how we should think about how you're coming at the share repurchase program? And then, just two cash flow questions. One being, in terms of pension contributions going forward, are you now expecting any? And of what magnitude, if so? And then last, let me stop there.","Steve Voorhees","I'll let Ward respond to the pension question. With respect to share repurchases, we have our program out. There's a variety of ways we can go about implementing that, and just haven't come to a final conclusion yet.","Ward Dickson","With the pension plan, obviously with the merger of the US plans, we don't need to make contributions. We still have the partially unfunded pension plan in Candida, and we will be making contributions of around $35 million in the year.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Alright, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.","George Staphos","Thanks everyone, and good morning. I guess the first question I had for you, in past quarters, you've provided and earnings-per-share guidance for the upcoming quarter. If you mentioned it here I missed it. If you did not mention it, I'm guessing it's because there's so many moving parts with write-ups, with the acquisition accounting, et cetera. That, it may be is not fruitful for you to do that. Could you comment to that end, whether you'll be providing quarterly earnings guidance on a going forward basis?","And then, specific to the productivity goals and inflation, would it be fair to assume that, because of your actions, that the labor inflation, and to some degree even the commodity inflation, should trend lower in years 2 and 3 of the program, such that you maybe get some widening of spread, and improvement in earnings from that source, thanks.","Steve Voorhees","We did not provide guidance and you just hit the mark on why. We just haven't come to a conclusion about whether we'll provide revenue guidance going forward. With respect to the labor question, Ward, do you have thoughts on that?","Ward Dickson","George, if you look at the overall synergies and performance improvements within the billion dollar goal, labor is a component of it. We identified that the labor across the whole company, so that's both the SG&A pool and the manufacturing and indirect manufacturing expenses, $3.5 billion per year. It is a component of the synergy pool. But, as you can tell, the largest individual item in the synergy pool is the procurement savings that we're going to have, by having that combined leverage of the two companies. So I think trying to project what inflation and commodity price movements are going to be over the three-year period is hard. We just try to put a stake in the ground for you.","George Staphos","Ward, if I could just ask a follow-on, just on the guidance. Then, I'll turn it over. Historically, the fourth fiscal quarter was RockTenn's largest quarter. Would there be anything now, in terms of the mixture of the two businesses, supply chain, what have you, such that that would not be the case? Again, recognizing that there are going to be lots of moving parts in this particular quarter. Thank you.","Ward Dickson","As we look at the underlying performance of the business, some of the trends that Steve highlighted. I would say that we're seeing continuing into the fourth quarter. We will start to recognize some of the initial synergies, related to some of the corporate overhead pools. But again, the primary reason that we described for not giving guidance in the quarter was that, we truly want to close the books for a month. We've got a lot of moving pieces, as you described, with the opening balance sheet and the consolidation.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Philip Nadeau. Sir, your line is open.","Philip Nadeau","Good morning, strong quarter, congrats on that. You outpaced the market pretty nicely, on the corrugated site. How sustainable is that? And, do you start comping that benefit in Q4? And, any color in terms of how trends are shaking out in July would be great.","Steve Voorhees","I'll let Jim Porter respond to that.","Jim Porter","Good morning, Philip. We're pretty excited about the performance of our corrugated business, and the progress that we've made over the last number of months, we believe are solid and sustainable. Obviously, there's market variations that we have to adapt to. But, we've done tremendous work at changing the culture of our corrugated business, and investing in the assets. And, building a very execution-oriented manufacturing process. And, one focused on providing innovative solutions to our customers. That, we believe, is being received very well. I hope that gives some color, that supports our view.","Philip Nadeau","Got you. And Jim, I think last quarter, you guys were talking about how, in corrugated, you were going to build some inventory, and go into fiscal fourth quarter, you're going to draw it down. Can you provide any update on that front?","Jim Porter","The question is on containerboard inventories?","Philip Nadeau","Yes. I think if I remember correctly, on the last call, you mentioned you were going to build some inventory and fiscal 3Q and then draw it down in fiscal 4Q. Any update on that front would be helpful.","Jim Porter","Okay, exactly. Inventories are something that we micro-manage, if you will, to ensure that we can provide adequate supply to our internal packaging operations, as well as our customers. And, we've just completed a large downtime quarter. Being the last quarter. And so, our inventories dropped, as did the industry inventories dropped. As we reflect on inventories in general, I know there's a lot of press on the costs for current industry inventories, relative to the average 10-year inventories. And, we just think that's really not apples to apples, today. Examples being that, we acquired the Smurfit-Stone assets in 2011. And, they just had a very unsustainably low level of inventory. That was not capable of providing our internal packaging operations the ability to perform, with appropriate on-time delivery and supply chain costs that were sustainable.","And so, we today focus our inventories on what is the optimal safety stock, doing supply chain math to try to manage that very crisply. And so, we think inventories are at a sustainable level. That is something that we will flex with changes in our mill operating uptime, and the conditions in the market relative to rail and truck availability et cetera.","Philip Nadeau","Okay. That's helpful. If I could sneak one in for Ward. If I heard you correctly, you're looking to potentially ramp up your leverage pretty quickly to that 2.25 times to 2.5 times. Is most of that going to be used for buybacks? Or, maybe some cushion for M&A? How should we be thinking about that? Thanks.","Ward Dickson","The 2.25X to 2.5X, and our capital allocation strategy, is one about balance. We have the authorization in place to be able to go ahead and execute around the share repurchase. And, we have the liquidity to do that, and to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they arise. I think the message that we gave when we announced the strategy is, it's one of balance. We'll be able to execute on any of the levers.","Philip Nadeau","Okay, very hopeful. Good luck on the quarter, guys.","Ward Dickson","Thanks.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Mark Wilde","Good morning. Steve, I wondered just going back to this billion dollar number. If you could just give us a little color on how you think about the interplay between taking costs out, and actually dropping that to the bottom line, versus the ongoing cost reduction that you have to do to stay competitive in the business?","Steve Voorhees","Both of those factors are considered in the billion dollars. We have got some feedback that maybe the billion dollars might be light. I think a billion dollars is a lot of money, and if we can do that, that will be a tremendous performance. And, I think we are looking at trying to optimize the business. And, I want to be able to grow the business overtime. And so, that's the balance that we need to be looking at and will look at.","Mark Wilde","When you put it all together, how much of that billion do you think you can actually hold onto?","Steve Voorhees","I think the expectation is we - are you talking about from a -","Mark Wilde","From a margin standpoint, how much of that really is in margin, and that you can retain in margin?","Steve Voorhees","I really can't speculate on that because we're in a competitive business. A lot of companies are doing very similar at times. All I know is that, the billion dollars is the opportunity I see that WestRock has, today, as we said. And, I feel very good about our ability to do that. Okay. And Steve, one other question. I've been with you a few times over the last six or eight months, where you've talked about the importance, in transactions, of just getting the culture right from the get-go. You want to provide just a little color on what you're doing, right now, to the culture right? We've invested a lot of time integrating both organizations. I think both organizations are a lot more complementary and similar than I think a lot of people thought. We're not taking it for granted. We're investing a lot. The management's going out and identifying the issues which are out. And, we are addressing them.","I'm very optimistic about the organization coming together. I prefaced, or made an initial comment, that we have got enthusiastic alignment about the aspiration that we have for WestRock and everywhere I've been, and I've been a lot of places over the last several months, that resonates very clearly across the organization.","Mark Wilde","Okay, great. Good luck in the coming quarters.","Steve Voorhees","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Alright, thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Mr. Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Sir, your line is open.","Adam Josephson","Thanks, good morning, everyone and congratulations on your solid performance of thus far. Jim or Steve just one on containerboard. Steve you said, or I believe earlier, that the linerboard market is tight. We've seen the export data, kraft linerboard exports up pretty significantly, year to date. And, obviously, prices are down to some extent. So, can you just reconcile the statement that the linerboard market is tight, with the significant increase we've seen in exports year to date?","Steve Voorhees","Go ahead, Jim.","Jim Porter","We have seen significant increases in export. And, we have a very tight linerboard environment in North America. Our market place is the world. We, of course, have a very strong position in the North American independent converter community. But, we also sell to most countries of the world. And, that's been our philosophy, to try to diversify our mix to those markets. And, we see solid demand in every one of them Relative to the currency impact of a strong US dollar, that does it have pressure on price. The good news is, is that price hasn't dropped at par with the currency changes. And, frankly, much of that change in currency-related price occurred in the last quarter of 2014, in the last two quarters of 2014. And, our current year at three quarters has been relatively solid. We think much of that impact is gone. We're seeing strong markets in the world and prices firming.","Adam Josephson","Just one follow-up to that. I appreciate that the global market is growing, but are you surprised that exports are up? Kraft linerboards are up 9%. I wouldn't think that global demand would be growing at that kind of rate.","Jim Porter","What we see is that virgin containerboard is very much in demand. The international markets of recycled containerboard, which trade at lower levels, the substitution has occurred. And so, the growth in agricultural markets of the world are being fueled by virgin containerboard. And, we don't see that surprising at all. And, frankly, that's our underlying premise for being heavily invested in that business.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. And, just one on OCC. Do you have any thoughts, long-term, as to where OCC is most likely to go? And, what implication do you think that would have on North American containerboard industry competitive dynamics?","Steve Voorhees","Great question. We have tried to, and always do, build trend-lines out into the future and the only thing for certain is they're usually wrong. What we see in the current marketplace that the global market has firmed. China has been somewhat sleepy for the last number of months and quarters. For the last three months, there was some firming. However, it's softened again. We think that generally the recovered-fiber markets are firm. We do not see any runaway trend occurring. Relative to long-term, it's a global market, both wood and recovered fiber. We'll likely have some upward inflationary trend, but we would guess those to be in balance, as recovery rates increase globally. And the marketplace plays out.","Ward Dickson","And, to the question of North American competitiveness we think the cost structure of the North American containerboard business is highly competitive with anywhere else in the world. And so, we like our position.","Adam Josephson","Thanks, a lot. Best of luck in the quarter.","Jim Porter","Thanks.","Operator","Alright, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Sir, your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Yes, thank you very much, good morning, and congratulations on all the hard work that I know has been going on for a long time. Thanks also for the update on the integration issue. It's interesting. It seems like you guys are probably among the larger players. And, you can correct me, the least forward integrated into boxes. And yet, we've seen this trend in the last couple years of independent box plants, or at least the sheet feeders that provide them, being acquired by mill owners. I didn't know if that's, especially with the last year's West Coast mill purchase, if that's something that you would consider, as you think about growing the company, is more forward integration?","Steve Voorhees","Chip, yes we would. I think we'd look at opportunities to improve our business, and that would fit within that category.","Chip Dillon","Okay, got you. Could you talk a little bit about, you mentioned the tightness in kraft linerboard. And, the AF&PA reported that if you look just at craft linerboard, the US capacity is actually lower today than it was six years ago. I'm sure part of that was due to the Smurfit-Stone shutdowns and crisis. But, nonetheless, we've seen a big competitor announce a small increase in their system capacity over the next few years. Do you feel that there are still actions you can take, to free up kraft linerboard capacity in your system? And I asked that because you've already done quite a bit of work, on your system, in the wake of the Smurfit-Stone deal.","Steve Voorhees","I think we have opportunities to improve our overall system. I think it's kind of hard to speculate on what we'll do with respect to capacity, going forward. I think in our billion dollars, we do have capital across our entire system, to improve the operating performance.","Chip Dillon","I see. Thank you.","Operator","Alright, thank you. Our next question comes from Ms. Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Ma'am, your line is open.","Debbie Jones","Hi, good morning.","Steve Voorhees","Hi, Debbie.","Debbie Jones","I was wondering if you could help us understand your results in Brazil. You had a great quarter. Obviously, you\u2019re performing much better than the market. How much of this have to do with your competitive position and the investments that you've made down there?","Steve Voorhees","I think it has a lot to do with the investments that we've made. We had a very significant investment in the middle, and they've been knocking it out of the park. We've also focused on protein markets, which fit the product that we make. We've had good success there. And then, we've expanded regionally in different areas of the country, which has given us more position in the box market. That pretty much explains the performance. I will add, all that doesn't occur without people. And I went down there, I was very impressed with the organization they have in there. They fit extremely well into the overall WestRock system.","Debbie Jones","And, just one follow up. You said a pretty attractive dividend. How should we think about that, going forward, in terms of your dividend policy? Whether it be progressive, looking at a payout or cover ratio?","Ward Dickson","Debbie, this is Ward. Although we haven't given a payout ratio, we feel like we set a pretty attractive dividend, compared to the S&P 500 Index, and competitive with our peers. We look at it in combination with our overall capital allocation strategy, in the context of both our ability to invest in our business, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, and then to also pursue share repurchases, to manage within the target leverage ratio. I think we feel pretty comfortable with where we set it, and we think it's very attractive initial dividend level.","Debbie Jones","Thank you. I would agree, and I will turn it over.","Operator","Alright, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Sir, your line is open.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks, good morning.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gaffner","Hey, Steve. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on the projected synergy, or overall cost savings run rates. I think you said you would be at $150 million by the end of September, on a run rate basis. Is that just since July 1? Or, is that for the full fiscal year that you would get to that run rate, and is that mostly around the SG&A savings?","Steve Voorhees","What we started to do is, we started to form the teams and do the planning. We started to evaluate costs from the beginning of the calendar year. And so, It's the accumulation of efforts that has been taking place. And just remember, it's the combination of the synergies, and just the ongoing productivity efforts, that we have across the whole organization. What we did highlight is that, we will recognize a portion of the SG&A and infrastructure cost, related to some of the duplicate corporate costs, pretty quickly. And, that is contributing to the run rate. Plus, also, the procurement synergies. We're moving very quickly on sourcing activities within the combined WestRock. And, we'll start to achieve some of those gains as we exit the calendar year.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And, when you look at the capital you outlined four 2016, the $850 million, anything you've identified on the $500 million around potential capital avoidance? Where, maybe some assets were over invested in? Maybe, could that come down in 2017?","Steve Voorhees","No. There might be someplace, but I can't think of anywhere. What we did, given the circumstances, do a very complete job of our capital planning. And, I think we are very measured in our approach, and I think that's just what we came up with.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And just lastly, given the combined entities only been together for about one month, have you had any customers come to your proactively around cross-selling opportunities? Where, maybe, you didn't have certain substrates before? Has that come to fruition yet?","Steve Voorhees","I'm going to let Bob Beckler respond to that.","Bob Beckler","Scott, that's a great question. It's been one of the pleasant surprises of the merger, right out of the gates. We're seeing it all over with customer interests. It really falls into three categories. As you pointed out, just the sheer breadth of offer that we have in our packaging platform, corrugated folding carton, beverage, packaging dispensing systems and merchandising displays. Also, we have scale in all of these packaging segments. And so, we are number 1 and number 2 in each of those that I just listed. And then, finally, there's a recognition that these have interplay. That they are connected.","And so, we're having a lot of dialogue with customers around how to connect together our capabilities. Not just around the packaging products themselves, but our ability to work with them in their facilities, to bring out the complete value that the packaging can offer. So, summing it all up, the answer is a big yes and we're very excited about the potential.","Scott Gaffner","Great, thanks for all the details.","Operator","Aright, thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Sir, your line is open.","Antony Pettinari","Good morning and congratulations on the debut. Prior to the merger, the Specialty Chemicals spin was already in the works. As you look at the portfolio today, is it fair to say that you\u2019re pleased with the WestRock portfolio as it stands? Or, do you think over the next few months, there might be additional businesses you might reevaluate, as to whether they're a fit for WestRock, longer term?","Steve Voorhees","We're comfortable with the portfolio as it currently stands.","Antony Pettinari","Okay. And then just following up on Scott's question, regarding the billion dollar target and performance improvements and you're $850 million CapEx guidance for next year, as you move beyond 2016, would you anticipate CapEx would ever need to ramp up meaningfully to hit that billion dollar target? Or, do you think you can achieve that target while keeping CapEx around that $850 million level?","Steve Voorhees","We're looking at a number of projects. And, I think they generally fit within the capital that we've had. Out there, I think we always look at our system and try to find opportunities to be able to invest capital wisely. I think the premise is that, we can do that within the capital that we outlined.","Antony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one final one. As you pursue the performance improvements, are there any large IT systems integrations, our IT rollouts, that will be required to tie together RockTenn and MeadWestvaco's financial and manufacturing systems?","Ward Dickson","Certainly, from an infrastructure point of view, there is. So, there's the opportunity to consolidate data centers across the combined footprint. And then, we do have the opportunity to harmonize some of the applications in our North American mill portfolio. And we have included those in some of our plans, over the course of the three-year period.","Antony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. I will turn it over.","Operator","Alright, thank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple quick ones, because I know we are deep in the call. But, if I could come back to the - you gave a capital outlook next year of $850 million and that's inclusive of what you're doing this year, for capital return projects and other elements. What might the spend be, to get the rest of the billion dollars? i.e. maybe the $300 million of deal-related synergies, et cetera. Should we think of something as a one- to two-year payback, that's required to get those, that comes out? So, an idea of what other cost expenses are. The next cadence of that, for the next, call it, next 12 months or 18 months.","Steve Voorhees","Within the $100 million there's some of the expenses related to the IT projects, that I described. For which, we'll be able to yield some meaningful savings, again, data center consolidation and other opportunities. I think the other components of it are really, of the billion dollars, are the ongoing productivity programs that we have in both organizations. That includes investments in capital, for a return generating projects. Within the $300 million, the three key components of the $300 million were null and converting footprint optimization, SG&A and infrastructure cost reductions and then the procurement organization. Getting the leverage across the combined spend of the two companies. There really isn't a lot of other incremental cost inside the $100 million that we described. So, we had severance related costs and we have some capital related costs on the IT side.","Chris Manuel","I appreciate that. What I'm asking is, to get that $300 million in savings - so, for cash that you are going to have gone out the next 12 months or 18 months, for severance, manufacturing, optimization and other pieces. Should we assume a three-year payback, that it's $100 million then? Or, something like that? Or, how should we think about that?","Ward Dickson","Again [Multiple Speakers] a cash flow model. And, we're looking for some of the big inflow\/outflow components.","Steve Voorhees","Again, we described the - out of the $100 million required to capture the synergies, we described - a portion of it is going to be paid from the pension plan assets. And then, the remainder of it will be paid, I think, over the course of the first 18 months to 24 months of the integration.","Chris Manuel","Thanks. That's helpful. I might have missed part of that. The second question I had was, as you talked about the ramp-up of share repurchase, can you maybe help us with what might or might not be, from a timing perspective, the advantage of beginning our share repurchase program either ahead? Or, the advantage\/disadvantage of waiting until after you've executed the chemical spin to do that.","Steve Voorhees","I don't think the chemical spin is a factor in how we think about share repurchase.","Chris Manuel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have Mr. Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research again in the line. Sir, your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. I was hoping to just come back and maybe get a little bit more help, if you could, on the set up for the coming quarter. One question was, I see you have the 12 month EBITDA for MeadWestvaco and RockTenn separately. Do you have the third, what the most recent, quarter for MeadWestvaco was? And is it fair to, essentially, just use the base of those two combined? You provided guidance on a number of the other measures. But then, if we were to look at what we would've expected RockTenn, separately, to have done one quarter to the next, MeadWestvaco one quarter to the next, would that get us to a number? Or, might there be some other drivers that we need to be conscious of, that can affect where the outcome would be? I realize that it may simply be there are no other outcomes, and it's not an important question. I just wanted to make sure I was not missing something.","Ward Dickson","Some of the obvious other drivers that you have to look at is, any changes in commodity cost, sequentially. Any changes in exchange rates, sequentially. But Steve, I don't know if you have anything to add?","Steve Voorhees","Mark, I think you outlined the questions and I think you've got relevant questions. I think you're very good at going through our disclosure and putting together your model. I think what you've got, I think you should be able to work with.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Speakers we still have one question on queue. This comes from Mr. Richard Leach from RLR Capital Management. Sir, your line is open.","Richard Leach","Thank you for taking my question. What do you estimate the fully diluted share count will be for the September quarter?","Steve Voorhees","$266 million.","Richard Leach","Great. That's it. Thank you very much.","Steve Voorhees","If there are no other questions, I very much appreciate your staying on this lengthy call. And, I appreciate your listening to the prepared remarks and look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you everyone. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"22955":["WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call August  1, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","James Armstrong - Vice President of Investor Relations","Steve Voorhees - Chief Executive Officer","Ward Dickson - Chief Financial Officer","Jeff Chalovich - Chief Commercial Officer & President of Corrugated Packaging","Pat Lindner - President of Consumer Packaging","Conference Call Participants","John Babcock - Bank of America","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","John Rider - Stephens","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global","Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets","Steve Chercover - D.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Chris. Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings call. We issued our press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. The release and presentation can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the right side of the application you are using to view this webcast.","With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; our Chief Financial Officer, Ward Dickson; the Chief Commercial Officer and President of Corrugated Packaging, Jeff Chalovich; as well as our President of Consumer Packaging, Pat Lindner. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filing with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call.","We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. As mentioned previously the slide presentation is available on our website.","With that said, I'll now turn it over to you Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thank you, James. Good morning. Thanks for joining our call this morning as we discuss our fiscal third quarter results and outlook. WestRock's net sales increased to $4.7 billion. This was 16% over last year. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased to $858 million. This is 14% over last year. Our adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 18.3%.","The WestRock team is performing extremely well as we proactively respond to a changing industry landscape, characterized by the challenges of additional new paper capacity, combined with softer demand in some markets. We see increasing opportunities for sustainable packaging, e-commerce packaging and value-added packaging solutions. We generated $749 million in adjusted operating cash flow during the quarter and we deployed $351 million of this cash flow in capital investments. This included $181 million invested in our strategic capital projects. We paid $117 million in dividends and we reduced our net debt by $282 million. Our net leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.95 times. Our pension plans remain fully funded.","Improvement in our financial results has been driven by the actions we have taken to grow our business organically by providing value-added solutions to our customers, improving our asset base through capital investment and simplifying our business to take advantage of our scale. I'll discuss the progress we're making in each of these areas during my comments.","Let's turn to slide 4. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased by $104 million. Setting aside the impact of KapStone, volumes declined primarily due to lower containerboard and paperboard shipments. We had favorable price and mix in both segments due to the flow-through of the previously published price increases. Our productivity improvements outpaced inflation. Inflation of $44 million was primarily due to wage and other cost. Higher wood and freight cost were essentially offset by the lower cost of recovered fiber.","We captured $47 million in productivity from the capital, synergy and other performance-improvement projects we've implemented over the past year. Economic downtime and scheduled consumer outages reduced EBITDA by $45 million and the KapStone acquisition contributed $152 million of year-over-year adjusted segment EBITDA improvement.","Corrugated Packaging segment sales, excluding recycling, increased 32% and adjusted segment EBITDA increased 28% as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. North American corrugated adjusted segment EBITDA margins improved to 23.1%, up 110 basis points. This was the seventh consecutive quarter that we have reported North American corrugated adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 20% or more.","This sustained strong performance is a direct result of WestRock's Corrugated Packaging team's focused implementation of our differentiation strategy to help our customers win, all the while investing in the capital systems, processes and people to enable improvements in the quality and cost of our products across our integrated system. We reduced containerboard and kraft paper production by taking approximately 259,000 tons of downtime, including 94,000 tons attributable to planned maintenance and 165,000 tons of economic downtime. Our inventories at the end of June were 123,000 tons below March levels and 182,000 tons below the peak in December. Our inventory levels are now in our desired range of what we need to efficiently operate our system.","Our box volumes increased 20% on a per-day basis over last year. Our organic box volumes increased 2.7% due to our success in delivering customized solutions that enable our customers to win in their markets. Corrugated sales into distribution and e-commerce uses were up. We saw growth in packaged food. Agriculture shipments were down due to wet weather in the Western United States.","Our containerboard integration rate was 80% for the second consecutive quarter. You might recall, on our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call that we first articulated the goal to increase our integration to 80%. At that time, our integration rate was 72%. We have made substantial progress in just two years.","We are updating our integration rate target to reach 90% over the next several years. This provides us ample room to grow our box volumes, while serving our preferred domestic and export markets. The Florence paper machine project is well underway and the new machine is on schedule to start up during the first half of calendar 2020.","As a reminder, this project will replace three obsolete paper machines with a new state-of-the-art, low-cost paper machine that's optimally designed for today's and tomorrow's market requirements, producing lighter and better-performing kraft linerboard.","Brazil. Brazil's adjusted segment EBITDA margins for the quarter were 27.9%. The Porto Feliz box plant is running very well and ramping up production. Our Valinhos box plant is largely down. We'll have our grand opening of WestRock's largest and most technically advanced box plant in October. The Tres Barras mill upgrade project is well underway. Construction's on track and startup is scheduled for the first half of calendar 2021. The majority of the capital investment on this project will incur -- will occur in fiscal 2020.","The integration of KapStone has progressed exceptionally well. We are realizing our synergy and performance improvement targets ahead of schedule. We're at an annual rate of $80 million at the end of June and we expect to exceed our $200 million target by the end of fiscal '21. The pace of the KapStone integration is benefited from the investments we have made in our box and mill system over the past several years. Our scaled and simplified operating systems and regional structure have accelerated our integration activities.","Multiple KapStone box plants in the Longview mill have already transitioned to WestRock operating systems. We've internalized 71,000 tons of annualized box shipments through our Victory Packaging system. And we expect to achieve 100,000 annualized tons by the end of September. With the addition of KapStone, the scale, geographic reach, full range of containerboard and kraft paper grades and box-making technologies of our Corrugated Packaging network enables us to reliably and efficiently serve our customers throughout North America.","The Consumer Packaging business reported adjusted segment EBITDA of $233 million during a quarter in which we invested in three strategic capital projects at our mills that will improve margins and the long-term performance of the business. We realized price\/mix improvements of $38 million and productivity improvements of $9 million.","Our backlogs remain at four to six weeks across SBS, CNK and CRB. We completed the major capital maintenance outages at Mahrt, Demopolis and Covington in the quarter. The Mahrt outage was completed early in the quarter and we are exceeding our project objectives for volume, quality and cost. We replaced the headbox at our Demopolis mill in June and this investment is also performing well. At Covington customer qualifications are in process and have gone very well to date.","The aggregate impact of these outages as well as regular maintenance outages at our other mills adversely affected our financial performance in the quarter by $22 million. The mill outages challenged our supply chain resulting in lower paperboard sales in the quarter, impacting EBITDA by an additional $16 million. Wood cost particularly at our Evadale mill remind -- remained elevated in the quarter due to the unusually wet weather in the region.","With the completion of these projects, we expect our supply chains to stabilize and see margin improvement during the current quarter. Converting shipments in Consumer Packaging increased 1.3% year-over-year. North American converting shipments increased 2.7% was partially offset by declines in Europe and Asia. Sustainable packaging and plastics replacements are generating significant market demand and interest.","We currently are working with dozens of customers on projects to replace plastics with fiber-based packaging. And we're currently at a $70 million run rate of incremental annual sales and we expect to reach a $100 million run rate by the end of this fiscal year.","We provide our customers with customized value-added solutions using the industry's broadest portfolio of paper and packaging solutions. This portfolio differentiates WestRock in the marketplace and enables us to help our customers lower their total costs, grow their sales, reduce the risk, and achieving their sustainability goals.","Our strategy of bringing our full suite of solutions to our customers is driving organic growth. 144 customers are buying more than $1 million of products and services from both our consumer and corrugated segments, accounting for approximately $6.8 billion of sales per year. These numbers represent more than a 40% improvement over the past three years.","We're enhancing the strength of our product and service offerings with the investments we're making in digital technology to automate customer experiences, simplify our processes and standardize our systems. A couple of examples include, the digital channel that many of our customers currently use to view and place orders and the advanced data analytics we use to anticipate unplanned downtime, reduce quality issues and minimize production variability.","We operate proprietary software that combines primary, secondary and tertiary packaging design to create packaging that minimizes waste and improves packaging performance for the benefit of our customers.","I want to take a few minutes to talk about the increase in SIOC packaging. SIOC is S-I-O-C Ships in Own Container. WestRock's comprehensive portfolio uniquely positions us to partner with customers to meet today's changing sustainable packaging mandates.","Amazon will soon require that all suppliers provide item -- that provide items, which are 18 by 14 by eight inches or larger used-packaging certified as ready-to-ship or face additional fees for packaging.","Using our integrated suite of products and working with our customers, we've developed solutions that create branded SIOC packages that meet these changing requirements.","A terrific example of our effort to develop SIOC solutions is our work with Colgate-Palmolive. In collaboration with Colgate, we created the SmileBox, which combines a folding carton manufactured by our joint-venture partner Grupo Gondi with Corrugated Packaging manufactured in our Winston-Salem facility to deliver an optimized branded SIOC package that's packed using WestRock machinery. The SmileBox has been very successful for Colgate. We're currently partnering with them on two dozen other SKUs for this type of packaging solution.","As consumers push for more sustainable packaging, ones that are recyclable, renewable and minimize material use, WestRock's comprehensive portfolio of fiber based packaging solutions enables us to meet these needs for our customers. Branded SIOC packaging provides our customers with an opportunity to further build their brand loyalty and recognition and improve their customer experience.","Our partnership with customers extends to helping them build a sustainable supply chain. We're working with our customers including U.S. Auto Parts on installing our Box On Demand machines to create custom sized boxes for their products.","This rightsizing of packaging, lowers packaging materials and shipping costs. Our packaging solutions lower our customers' total cost and help them meet the changing e-commerce and market requirements.","Now I'll turn over to Ward. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. Turning to slide 11. We outline our key assumptions for our fourth quarter guidance. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter to be between $880 million and $925 million. This compares to adjusted segment EBITDA of $858 million in our third fiscal quarter and $802 million in the last year's fourth fiscal quarter.","Sequentially higher seasonal volumes across both segments should more than -- should be more than offset by the flow through of previously published containerboard and kraft paper price declines and lower containerboard export prices. We expect sequential cost deflation driven by declines in virgin fiber costs, freight costs, recycled fiber and seasonally lower energy costs.","In addition, we expect to see material sequential gains due to lower scheduled mill outages and seasonal productivity improvements in the fourth quarter. We anticipate consumer packaging margins will improve over third quarter levels.","Depreciation, amortization and other items should be approximately $0.02 per share higher quarter-over-quarter and our tax rate in the fourth quarter should be consistent with our third quarter rate. We received $15 million in business interruption proceeds from the Panama City insurance claim in the third quarter and we expect to receive a similar amount in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our balance sheet. We remain committed to returning our long-term leverage ratio and generating significant free cash flow. We expect fiscal 2020 capital expenditures will decline to a level of approximately $1.1 billion, $300 million less than this year.","We also anticipate the capital expenditures will decrease $900 million to $1 billion in fiscal 2021. As we complete our strategic capital projects we remain committed to a stable and growing dividend and our primary use of free cash flow in the near-term will be debt reduction.","I'll now turn it back over to Steve for closing remarks.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. WestRock team's performing extremely well as we proactively respond to a changing industry environment characterized by the challenges of additional new paper capacity combined with softer demand in some markets.","We see increasing opportunities for sustainable packaging, e-commerce packaging and value-added packaging solutions. We're growing organically by creating customized value-added solutions for our customers that support their needs to grow their sales, reduce their total costs and risks all while helping them achieve their sustainability goals.","We're investing in our business for the long-term to sustain and expand our competitive advantage. And we're building our systems and processes to take advantage of the scale of our platform.","We're moving from a period of a growth by acquisition, investment in large strategic projects and building the advantages of scale into our business to a period of increased focus on organic growth, innovation, productivity and free cash flow generation, a combination that will create value for our customers\u2019, stockholders and teammates for the long term.","James, that completes my prepared remarks. We're ready for Q&A.","James Armstrong ","Thank you, Steve. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can we please take our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open. ","John Babcock","Good morning. It's actually John Babcock on the line for George. Just starting out I was wondering if you could talk about \u2013 well, first of all, the early fiscal 4Q volume trends. And then earlier you also referenced getting your integration rate to 90%. And wanted to get a bit more color on how you expect to get there and if you can provide a little bit more detail on timeline of your input?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. Good morning, John. It's Jeff Chalovich. So quarter-to-date starting on July our shipments are up about 5.4%. That's organic. If you take KapStone and then we're up a little bit over 23%. So part of the 5% came from early in the month -- prime day in some of our e-commerce shipments. So that's about one point of that 5.4% and then our Victory shipments contributed about 0.8% to that.","Overall, our backlogs are strong. They've ticked down a little bit from the first half, but they're in line with what we saw in both May and June months. And we finished 2.2% up in May and 4.4% in June. So I'm not expecting a 5% but our volumes and backlog's still strong through this month.","The strong markets -- we continue see strong markets certainly in e-commerce, bakery, snack foods. Ag started a little slow as we mentioned, but we're seeing pickup now with the better weather in the west and some of the northwest. Cherry season was decent and now apple. We're waiting we see some pickup there.","Now we continue to win basically with solution sales while we've shown the ability to grow organically. And if you look at how we've grown the last three years we're adding 180,000 to 200,000 tons a year to the converting system. So that will imply 4 to 5 years we can make that 90% integration rates. And we've shown the ability to do that over the past three years.","Now we have some great examples of our business growing what Steve mentions based on our differentiation. And so the solutions we're providing in supply chain optimization automation some of the Box on Demand that you saw solving problems in DIM weight taking costs out. We have some great examples of wins in the period in the quarter clearly that really show the benefit of solutions selling through the corrugated segment, but also the breadth of products we bring across the enterprise.","And I'll point out a few little large bakery customer that with our new Linkx acquisition we added $1 million of machinery based on our pellet sizing opportunity. So that's the BoxSizer. We had our first two sales of BoxSizer. We have about 40 customers in line of 40 machines in the queue that customers\u2019 wants to talk to us about those. So we have an open house late in August where we have about two dozen customers looking at that business. But that's $5 million of sales wrapped up for five years, $5 million a year for five years.","Our merchandise display had their first machine sales through their group, $9 million of sales in equipment for a seven-year contract, $5 million a year or $35 million. We had an enterprise win, oatmeal customer that does breakfast foods, bags that go into a folding carton and those folding cartons go into a box. That was our first sale of machinery there, about $3 million in machinery and then $11 million of folding carton and boxes.","And then, Victory had their first machine sales through our APS group. We had $1 million in sales from machine, $1 million in Corrugated Packaging and $0.5 million in the consumables for a five-year. We're obviously seeing great lift in our retail-ready shelf-ready packaging through our graphics business. So all those things combined will help us to grow continually. And then, on the other side of the house, for our Machinery business, we have great things going on with consumer and plastic replacements and shrink. They're just augmenting and helping us grow. And I'd say, Pat if you want to comment on that piece.","Pat Lindner","Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate that. Well, first of all, a little bit on the quarter and how we're seeing the original question around the fourth quarter demand. In our volume trends, we still see pretty strong demand. I think year-over-year, we're probably flat, up slightly. But sequentially, we expect to be on track and up a little bit.","We are ramping up, as you'll see in our results from our three strategic outages in our mill system. We see strength in food service as well as in beverage and you'll also see from our results that our converting assets we're up about 2.7% in North America and that\u2019s driven by food service and beverage largely and that continues into this quarter.","What Jeff was mentioning around some of the plastics replacements and we may get into this later, but this is a tremendous opportunity for our business and for our entire company. It's rare to see in an industry this type of, what I'll call, not-in-kind substitution. We're replacing material like plastic with paper and we're seeing this really ramp up. It hit a tipping point for our industry and this is really exciting.","A couple of the examples, or maybe one I'll just share right is -- and we talked about this last quarter briefly as an introduction, but we won some significant business with Diageo where they are replacing their plastic shrink wrap with a paper-based solution. It's our Cluster-Pak solution.","And to Jeff's earlier point around machinery, a key part of us winning this is our value proposition that we bring around machinery and producing -- and designing and producing a machine that operates at much faster rates, it's in the competitions. And along with that comes the carton business that's based on our CNK, our high strength and high wet strength CNK product.","So, that's a great example and there are others as well that we have. But that's a great example where we're taking machinery, combining it with our design around materials. And just in this quarter, the quarter reporting on, here in the third quarter we picked up two new machines, as they scale up, and the cartons associated with that. So we're really excited about the opportunity to leverage our full value proposition and our capabilities in driving the plastics-to-paper replacement efforts.","James Armstrong","Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire","Hi. Good morning everyone. Just a question on the CapEx outlook. I think late last year you were talking more like $1.25 billion for 2020 and some flow-through from growth projects into 2021 on a base of about $1 billion. And then, I think you lowered it in April to like $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2020, maybe $1 billion in 2021. And now, looks like you're taking it down again to $1.1 billion next year, $900 million to $1 billion in 2021, if I heard you right.","Just wondering, what are the moving pieces there? Does that imply maybe that you don't think there'll be as much growth in the industry and you don't need to spend on projects? Or are you maybe just finding more savings and efficiencies in the projects and the spending that you're doing today?","And then just sort of tied into that, the comment around improving the integration to 90%, sort of, seems to imply some investment is needed in the downstream converting assets to kind of get there. Just wondering, if you think we'll just -- we might see some growth investment in that part of the business as some of the mill investment winds down. Thanks.","Ward Dickson","Okay, Brian. This is Ward. I'll start and then I'll have Jeff chime in on the converting investments. So you're right. This year we lowered our guidance to $1.4 billion. Embedded in that $1.4 billion, this was the peak year of our capital investments in our strategic projects. We'll invest over $500 million in the strategic projects.","Next year, as we move from FY 2019 to FY 2020, we've pinpointed FY 2020 now in the midpoint of the range that we previously gave you. We have just over $250 million, between $250 million and $275 million, that's targeted for the strategic capital projects next year. So the decline year-over-year is really being driven by the decline in the strategic projects.","I will say and as we've gotten into the KapStone assets, the integration of those assets, remember that we had set an ongoing CapEx level to support KapStone at approximately $150 million. We believe now with a better understanding of the assets that those investments are lower. So that's why we're confident in the \u2013 that we can both complete the strategic capital investments and continue to make investments inside of our system, to generate productivity and differentiation. As you know, we have invested substantially into our \u2013 over the last three to five years into our container network through the EVOL deployments. And so we have been modernizing that system and we're generating the benefits from those investments. Jeff, do you want to add anything to that?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. Hey, Brian. So I'd tag along to what Ward said. One of the things we found as we looked at the projects in the KapStone queue for capital over a three and five year period they were heavy in these next five years on container on their converting assets. And they have between $30 million and $60 million in Greenfields coming up. Based on the scale of our system, we don't need to do that. We have invested well as Ward has said in the container systems. So we've built up the capability over the last five years to grow organically. And so on our normal capital rate we continue to do that. And we've been able to reallocate capital based on what we've seen in the KapStone. But it also showed that we have the ability to create a list of high return projects on assets. So we're going to continue to look through that through the system, but this year and into the next year some of the capital that needed for new box plants, we don't need to do that. And we're able to reduce the capital expense because of that.","Brian Maguire","Okay great. One follow-up on consumer if I could for Pat. Just any change to your pricing term? I know one of your big peers talked about shortening some of the lags and implementing pricing. Not sure, if that was as much of a priority for you or you're seeing any change in terms going forward.","Pat Lindner","Yeah. Thanks Brian for the question. And when it comes to pricing, of course, we can't comment on any forward-looking dynamics in the marketplace or plans that we might have. But when we look at the pricing in this specific question around lag in capture of previously published price increases, we look at it in terms of a number of different net mechanisms that we have. And as you know, we have a wide cross-section of different customers and markets. So we have pricing or contracts in terms of pricing that link pricing to PPW as well as open contracts and cost base indices.","So it's a little bit difficult to give you just one answer because of the complication associated with that, because it does vary so much across the customers in the markets. But I think as you can see from our results, over the last nine months we have realized about $100 million. Actually, it was a little over $100 million of flow-through from those previously published price increases. And in the third quarter alone, it was $30 million a year -- $38 million year-over-year. So we're confident in our ability to capture the gains associated with those previously published price increases, but it's a little bit complicated to give you an exact number, because of the different mechanisms that we have.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Good morning. And thanks for all the details. If I look at your CapEx guidance just a quick question on this for the fiscal year that starts in three months \u2013 I'm sorry a year from three months from now the fiscal 2021 and I assume your DD&A saves at $1.53 billion that would suggest you would generate $2.25 billion of free cash flow, if you earn zero which is 6% of your stock price which means your free cash flow yield at zero earnings would be higher than almost all the rigid flexible packaging stocks. Could you just make sure my math is right? And also could you \u2013 do you have a thought as to whether that $900 million to $1 billion is sort of a sustainable level of CapEx that reflects modest growth projects in addition to maintenance?","Ward Dickson","So Chip, this is Ward. To be clear, we will generate a lot of free cash flow in this business. And that one of the levers that we have is we have been investing in these strategic projects. We will invest over $1 billion in these projects. And they are going to generate approximately $240 million worth of incremental EBITDA that will flow through to both earnings and cash flow generation for us. So we are comfortable that the ongoing level of strategic \u2013 base CapEx is going to be in that $900 million to $1 billion range. There is a small tail of the Tr\u00eas Barras mill in fiscal 2021. We have about $50 million to $60 million of capital that remains in FY 2021, and then the rest of it is our base CapEx that we're comfortable with. We do believe that the dividend yield and the free cash flow yield of WestRock is one of the compelling points of our valuation.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And just quick follow-up, when you look at the \u2013 that you were talking about the e-commerce impact of SIOC and you gave an example of the SmileBox. How do you think of some of the initiatives of making for frustration-free packaging that say Amazon is leading than others? How will the net impact of that be both on yourselves and the industry? I know, there are a lot of moving parts but are you seeing a reduction in corrugated demand because of this? Or is it slower growth? Or is it actually helping?","Jeff Chalovich","Hey Chip it's Jeff. Like you said it's -- there is a lot of moving parts. We are doing a considerable amount of testing for our customers for SIOC packaging. We have seen no degradation in our demand because of SIOC. It's -- I don't know if it will be a plus or a minus, but right now it hasn't degraded at all. We have seen more fallout in the smaller-box stuff from some of the envelopes and we are coming out with fiber-based envelopes from our consumer business and testing those as we speak in this quarter.","And we are looking at what we can do with our paper business also in some of the pouches. We also came out with a new machine that is making pouches out of fanfolds. So our pack on-demand will pack small from a 4x4, 6x6 up to a hoodie sweatshirt, a large bulky sweatshirt will help us compete in those markets and meet customers' demand in SIOC and also dim weight and shipment reductions. So, overall, we think we are well-poised to design, innovate around that. And when we help our customers win, I think, overall, that's good for us in the markets.","James Armstrong","Just as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Operator, can we have our next question please?","Operator","Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Your line is open.","John Rider","Hey good morning. This is actually John Rider on for Mark. So, question is if you could give us an update on the kraft paper business and if you expect pressure on plastics to have a material impact on that business over the two, three years? And just in terms of that if you could just give us a sense of which kraft paper markets are doing better than other?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. So, I'll start at the high point of the kraft paper. It's our DuraSorb, so saturated kraft. Demand is strong in that market and if we can make it, we can sell it. The demand on the kraft paper in aggregate is a bit matching containerboard. I think there has been more pressure lately on the kraft-bag markets. The extensible market's more challenged and that was really because seeds, cements, fertilizer in the Midwest, our customers' producing for those who were affected by the floods. So, that's off a bit along with the kraft bag, but not -- it's not substantial. It's a few thousand tons from what we expected.","And overall I would say that if you looked at inventories and stock where we have seen destocking in the containerboard space, the kraft bag space is a bit different right now. And we see inventories higher in a bit of a slower destocking in our kraft sack business and the extensible is where we have seen more than our regular bag.","In the long-term, I think yes that we have opportunities through our customers with plastic replacements and opportunities in the sustainability realm. And as I said we're looking at pouches, envelopes, and other things we can use in our kraft space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. First, I just wanted to clarify Jeff. So, when you were talking about July business, would you say that represents some pickup as one of your competitors suggests they were seeing? Or is it more kind of the same of what as what you had been seeing as another of the competitor had suggested?","Jeff Chalovich","It's a bit of a pickup Mark. Even without the prime and literally it's a bit of a pickup. If you look through the last quarter into this quarter, it's a pickup.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. And then I think that previously you told us a roughly 20% of your corrugated sales were now going through machinery-tied systems. Can you update us to what that might be now and where you think that could potentially go over? Any defined period of time?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. We're over 30 now more getting towards 40 with associations of our machinery to our packaging. And as we continue to expand the machine business. That pull ratio will continue to also grow. So, as we look at driving our differentiation higher, that's a major pillar in our differentiation strategy and solving major challenges for our customers.","So, there's not a customer today we don't talk to that's not having labor challenges, efficiency challenges trying to streamline their observations and solve supply chain issues. So, with our ability of innovation design and then to marry that with our automation platform across our whole enterprise, we expect sales lift from that.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thanks. That sounds like a really big increase. Is that a big reason why you think you've been very successful in gaining share in the last year or two?","Jeff Chalovich","Yes, that's part of it. I think the other part is the design that goes with that the innovation and just the solution set. We are providing solutions for customers across a broad array and we're able to do that now with our folding carton business.","NPS is another one. So, I'll give you a great example we just had. They are in a horticulture space and their horticulture tags were going to be replaced with labels. They needed an automated solution to label the flower pots. And so in 90 days, we designed a machine with the supplier partner, produced the machine. We kept the labels, we got the labels. They are digital so a person can scan on the label without having a horticulture tag and sold four machines immediately. And there's great upside for that. So that type of ability in our system across the whole enterprise is a great way to differentiate and grow our sales.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ketan Mamtora","Good morning. Can you remind us what is your integration level in Consumer Packaging? And has your view changed at all on kind of what level you need to be there in Consumer Packaging?","Pat Lindner","Yes. Thanks very much for the question. This is Pat. So our integration level overall is we consider to be about 60%. Let me describe a little bit of how that breaks down. In SBS we are a little bit over 50% integrated as a whole. About 20% of that goes through our folding carton business internally, so our internal conversion.","But that's a little bit understated because we have specialty applications such as tobacco, commercial print and a couple of other applications like liquid packaging where we consider those to be integrated because effectively we are specifying most of those downstream. So when you put all of that together we are actually in SBS about 55%.","In terms of CNK we are higher than that. We are at 70%. And CRB is about 60% a smaller part of our portfolio URB the uncoated recycle board is down around 30%. So overall net-net the weighted average of that is about 60% as an overall company. As far as your second question around are we happy with that and where it is we continue to look at this on an ongoing basis.","And our main priority right now is to -- as we drive integration and move that further to an integrated system, it's really all about organic growth for the plastics replacement opportunity and organic growth in general. But we see that as an opportunity to think about how do we strategic play in our markets and how we best serve our customers in those markets with our paper-based solution with again plastics replacements being one great opportunity.","That's not to say that we won't selectively explore inorganic opportunities but I think as you probably know there is -- other multiples in this space are still pretty high. And we've got to be very selective on deals that would look attractive to us. And so our focus right now is to drive organic growth as we look to in certain places to integrate or to increase our integration levels.","Ketan Mamtora","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D. A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","Good morning everyone. So first of all on the capital allocation priorities with respect to debt, I know you are still a touch above your target leverage ratio. But following the debt repayment in Q2 are you approaching a point where repurchasing stock might move up the pecking order in the capital allocation framework, considering you have got a 5% dividend that's probably up there -- commenced with some of your -- the coupons on your debt?","Steven Voorhees","That's a great question. I think that's something that we look at periodically. Just as the trade-off of that I think this past quarter we chose to pay down debt. But we will continue to look at over time. If you look at us over time we have done both.","And I think you've cited a couple of aspects that would make kind of share repurchase relatively more attractive. But I think this past quarter we were very comfortable paying down debt because I think from an enterprise standpoint our stockholders are getting the benefit of that almost dollar for dollar.","Steve Chercover","Yes. I agree. So I guess at some stage if you think that your equity is undervalued then it also makes sense to be front-end load it. And just a quick one on the KapStone synergies, they are continuing to accrue ahead of schedule. I know that you said you'll do better than $200 million which was the initial target. Is there a point where you are going to quantify how much more than $200 million you might be able to achieve?","Steve Voorhees","I think there won't be a point. I think our -- we'll get to $200 million and then we'll figure out how far we'll get past $200 million.","Steve Chercover","Okay. Thanks Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez","Thank you. Good morning guys. One quick one on Consumer Packaging, what's your outlook on at the SBS market which has been -- hasn't been as strong as the other grades? And also in terms of sustainability are you seeing similar trends in the U.S. as you are seeing in Europe in terms of shifting from plastics to paper-based packaging?","Pat Lindner","Yes. So thanks very much for the question. This is Pat. So, on the SBS market we actually see areas of pretty good growth. And as you know SBS is a pretty complicated one because of the broad market that it serves unlike some of the others which are a little bit more work focused in their markets.","So just looking at a couple of those segments, when you look at foodservice as an example foodservice is pretty strong right now and that's driven by sustainability, but I think it's also driven by just the trends in consumers today. There's a lot more interest in take-out and snacks and smaller meals rather than eating out with big meals.","And so a lot of our customers and retailers right now are looking to take advantage of that and offer packaging that helps service those needs and that demand. And many of those applications are moving towards to the extent they were in plastics they're moving towards paper more and more. That is the trend in North America. There's no question about that.","Now as far as other markets, certainly tobacco for SBS, certainly tobacco and commercial print continue to be in a secular decline, so that offsets some of those increases.","Now we're also pretty excited about what's happening in some of the plate markets as well as cup stock. The sustainability thing and this is one that's in Europe but also in North America to your other question, your second question is that SBS demand we think in the future could well be driven by some of the trends around sustainability around cup stock replacement.","And today those cups, for example, at Starbucks and others are polycoated so plastic coated on the inside. Now at WestRock, we can recycle that all the way through our entire system, our recycle system. But that's not true of many other recyclers in the industry. And so one of the things that we're doing there is that we're developing a fully recyclable coating and we recently won an award for that, the NextGen Cup Challenge. We won that and that was supported by a number of different companies like Starbucks and Coca-Cola and others. And so we're excited about that win.","We are in the process of customer trials. We\u2019re scaling that up where we think if that turns and really if we can commercialize that there's over 650 billion cups -- paper cups used in the world. And so we think there's an opportunity there, obviously, to drive some SBS demand. But that's still a piece that's very much in development.","And just closing out on your North America versus Europe in terms of sustainability, I think Europe has been in the lead in some areas, certainly on the beverage side. I mentioned Diageo example where we picked up some nice business around shrink wrap replacement and there's others happening as well with other big retailers and other big brands.","North America has been a bit more focused on that foodservice side. We think beverage will come, but around plastics and different types of packaging when you look at aluminum cans in particular, North America has a pretty eclectic and diverse selection of different packages that are used. That will happen but that one's a little bit behind the trend in Europe specifically on beverage.","Edlain Rodriguez","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. A question on the Florence facility for next year. How much -- given that a lot of that I assume is just going to be improved productivity and lower costs, how much is that project delivered just on that? So forgetting the small increment in capacity. But if we just focus on the improved cost position et cetera, can you give us a sense of that how big an impact that can be?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. I think what we've said previously it's in the $60 million range.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thank you","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Actually I just want to quickly follow-up on SBS. I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about, I mean so basically we had read about some supply changes in box for -- particularly in SBS. And so essentially wanted to get a sense for whether you're seeing an increase in demand associated with that?","Pat Lindner","Yeah. So SBS overall there has been a lot of changes in that market. And we can't comment other than some of the previously announced changes and additions and subtractions to the capacity that you've all seen.","I think going back to my earlier comment plastics replacements give us an opportunity to drive some increased SBS demand. I think its long-term direction is going to be dependent on the ability to capture some of those wins in plastics replacement.","The tobacco as well as the commercial print are offsets to that. So it's a little bit difficult to tell how all that is going to sort out, but right now what we see is we still have long backlogs in SBS. They're four to six weeks and maybe even on the upper end of that. We're ramping up from some of our production right now from the strategic outages to capture as much of that as we can.","So right now in the immediate term and right in the near-term it's really -- still pretty strong and pretty robust. But long-term I think depends on capturing some of these new innovative solutions that help solve some of the sustainability challenges particularly in the foodservice space.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to James Armstrong.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Chris and thank you to our audience for joining our call today. As always reach out to us if you have any questions. We are always happy to help. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Marcella, and I will be your conference operator today. I'd like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Results Call.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Marcella. Good morning, and thank you for joining our fiscal second quarter 2019 earnings call. We issued our press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the right-side of the application you are using to view this webcast.","With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; our Chief Financial Officer, Ward Dickson; our Chief Commercial Officer and President of Corrugated Packaging, Jeff Chalovich, as well as our new President of Consumer Packaging, Patrick Lindner and Bob Feeser. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question answer session.","During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates, and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. ","Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. As mentioned previously, the slide presentation is available on our website.","With that said, I'll now turn it over to you, Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, James. Good morning. Thanks for joining our call today. Our WestRock team delivered outstanding results in the second fiscal quarter of 2019. Our adjusted segment EBITDA of $757 million improved by $108 million over last year. The increase in EBITDA was primarily driven by the acquisition of KapStone and our adjusted EPS was $0.80 per share. ","We are responding to changing market conditions by matching our production to our customers\u2019 demand. During this past quarter, we reduced our containerboard and kraft paper production by nearly 300,000 tons with approximately 100,000 tons from plant maintenance and 200,000 tons from economic downtime across our system. ","We are focusing on organic growth opportunities where we can create customized value-added solutions for our customers that reduce their total cost and\/or grow their sales. This focus increased our packaging shipments during the quarter and increased the use of the converting assets across our system. This contributed to the realization of $68 million in productivity in the quarter.","We successfully completed the installation of the new curtain coater at the Mahrt Mill in March. This was the first of three significant projects in our Consumer Packaging Mill system and will be completed by the end of June. ","In aggregate, these projects will enhance our ability to meet our customers\u2019 developing needs and improve our cost structure. The advantages of our broad paper and packaging portfolio coupled with the multiple levers we have in our control provide me with confidence and our team\u2019s ability to create long-term value for our customers and our stockholders. ","Turning to the financial results for the quarter. We benefited from the flow through of previously published price increases for all of our major paper grades. The positive impact of price increases were offset by lower containerboard export volumes, economic downtime, mill outages and wage and other inflation. Higher wood costs were largely offset by lower recovered fiber cost. Our net leverage ratio was 2.96 times at the end of March. ","Corrugated Packaging adjusted segment EBITDA of $553 million increased by 24% over last year. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve reported North American corrugated margins of 20% or more. During the March quarter, we lowered our inventory levels by 60,000 tons and so far in April, we\u2019ve reduced our inventories by another 30,000 tons and have taken 55,000 tons of economic downtime.","Our box shipments grew 20% year-over-year on a per-day basis. After adjusting out the volumes from the KapStone Box plants, our volumes grew organically by 2% on a per-day basis over last year. Gains in e-commerce, food service, processed food and bakery contributed to this growth. ","Let\u2019s discuss our integration rate. Our integration rate for the last twelve months has been 77% and it was 80% this past quarter. Organic growth in box volumes contributed to the increase in integration. KapStone\u2019s complementary footprint have supported additional sales to existing WestRock customers who are now able to access our broader geographic footprint. ","We\u2019ve integrated an additional 67,000 tons in the annual box shipments through our Victory Packaging System. Also contributing to the increase in integration has been a decline in our export volumes, which during this past quarter accounted for only 10% of our total containerboard shipments. This compares to 15% in the same quarter of last year. ","We saw higher year-over-year inflation, especially in wood, freight, energy, labor and benefits. These inflationary pressures was partially offset by lower recycled fiber cost. We are making progress rebuilding the Panama City Mill. We expect the mill\u2019s two machines to build back up to normal production during the June quarter. Other repairs will be complete by the end of the calendar year. ","We recorded income from this $30 million in business interruption insurance proceeds. These proceeds were not included in our guidance for the quarter. After taking these proceeds into account, the contribution to income from the Panama City Mill was approximately equal to last year\u2019s contribution when the mill was fully operational. ","Brazil\u2019s adjusted segment EBITDA margins for the quarter declined to 22.2%, down from 26.8% last year. This decline was driven by overlapping cost as the Porto Feliz box plant ramps up and the Valinhos box plant ramps down. This will continue until Valinhos is closed this summer. ","Our Consumer Packaging business performed well during the quarter with sales up approximately 2% year-over-year as we realized higher prices from previously published price increases. Adjusted segment EBITDA was ahead of last year. The outage expense related to the Mahrt curtain coater project and significantly higher wood cost especially for our Covington Mill contributed to slightly lower margin. Without these two items, adjusted segment EBITDA margins would have been 180 basis points higher than what we reported. ","Our team delivered strong productivity of $41 million as a result of high operating utilization across our converting system and the benefits from the ongoing productivity program and capital investments. Commodity inflation was elevated in the quarter driven by wood costs that were $17 million higher year-over-year due to fiber supply challenges from the extended wet weather. ","We\u2019ve seen improvements in wood availability in April and we expect cost to moderate in the second half of the fiscal year. Backlogs remains strong across all of our major grades. In the second quarter, we experienced sales growth across our target end-markets, especially food service, retail food, beverage, beauty and cosmetics. ","In beverage, our machinery solutions are enabling customers to replace printed shrink film with more sustainable paperboard multi-packs. We\u2019ve installed more than 20 machines year-to-date including high speed machines for soft drink applications and basket wrap machines for beer to replace printed plastic film. Customer activity remains high and we have a strong machine pipeline for the second half. ","Our team at Mahrt successfully executed the installation of the new curtain coater in March and the mill is now fully operational. The start-up of the machine has gone extremely well and we are seeing the productivity benefits and lower coating cost that we expected. The Covington Mill upgrade is underway as I speak, and it will be complete in May. ","We are installing a new head box at the Demopolis Mill in June. The cost of the Covington and Demopolis projects will adversely impact our margins in the June quarter. In the September quarter, we will benefit from the volumes and improved quality and productivity available from all three projects, Mahrt, Covington and Demopolis. ","Looking into fiscal 2020, we expect improvement in margins from the capital projects and also the additional actions that we\u2019ll take across the segment to improve the value that we provide our customers and reduce the cost that we incur to deliver this value. We\u2019ve owned KapStone for six months. We\u2019ve made great progress with our integration activities. ","I am pleased with the level of engagement that our new teammates have demonstrated, and we are proceeding well with the integration. We\u2019ve accelerated the realization of the synergy and performance improvements and we are now at an annual runrate of $70 million. We expect to achieve a $90 million runrate by the end of this fiscal year. ","We expect to exceed the $200 million of runrate of synergy and performance improvements by the end of fiscal 2021. We are executing well across each integration category including our mill system, our box plant system, logistics, procurement, information technology, and administration. We\u2019ve internalized 67,000 tons of annual box shipments through our Victory Packaging System and we expect to achieve 100,000 annual tons by the end of fiscal 2019. ","We are pursuing many opportunities to improve our performance and profitability in the years to come. Between our strategic capital projects and the realization of synergies from KapStone, we see runway to more than $440 million of EBITDA improvement through 2022, of which only the $70 million runrate of KapStone\u2019s synergies has been realized. ","The new Florence paper machine project is progressing well and is on track for the announced start-up in the first half of calendar 2020. As we communicated when we announced the project, the primary benefits of the investment are quality improvements, and the increased operating efficiencies gained operating one new paper machine instead of the three older machines. ","In Brazil, the first pieces of equipment are already running at the Porto Feliz box plant and we expect to run higher volumes through the facility in the coming months. We\u2019ve already broken ground at the Tres Barras Mill and a significant amount of the machinery orders have been placed. The Tres Barras Mill project is well on track to be completed in fiscal 2021. ","In total, we expect to realized $80 million in runrate EBITDA in fiscal 2020 from the projects completed this year with the strategic projects adding $240 million a year in EBITDA by the end of fiscal 2022. We are delivering value to our customers by helping them lower their total cost, grow their sales, improve their sustainability and minimize their risk.","140 customers buy more than 1 million of products from both our Consumer and Corrugated segments. This accounts for $6 billion in annual sales. We are uniquely positioned to win with our customers and with our broad portfolio of paper, packaging, merchandizing, machinery and supply chain solutions. ","In February, we expanded Jeff Chalovich\u2019s role to lead our commercial efforts across WestRock. Jeff is off to a great start and accelerating our differentiated strategy in bringing added emphasis to top-line growth at WestRock. ","I am delighted to report that during this past quarter, WestRock was recognized twice by third-parties for our innovation in the manufacturing of sustainable paper and packaging products. The Sustainable Packaging Coalition recognized WestRock with its Innovator award for a decision to accept wholly coated food service packaging at our 100% recycled paperboard mills in the United States. ","Instead of this material going to landfill, we are able to process and recycle this fiber into new paper-based packaging. We\u2019ve developed a recyclable and compostable paperboard prototype designed to hold hot and cold beverages. This prototype was recently named one of twelve winners of the Next-Gen Cup Challenge and we are optimistic about our ability to fully commercialize this product. ","Our research and development on new more recyclable and compostable packaging designs exemplifies our commitment to working with our customers to find ways to make packaging more sustainable. Our customers are demanding even more environmentally sustainable solutions. Our broad portfolio of customized, value-added sustainable paper-based packaging solutions is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift in consumer preference and it\u2019s especially applicable when it comes to creating packaging solutions that reduces the use of plastic. ","Our solutions include the use of innovative materials, new designs, and the applications using our machinery platform. Examples of our plastic replacement products today include food service solutions like EnShield Natural Kraft that replaced plastics in bakery applications and the beverage packaging solutions such as the Cluster-Pak and the EconoClip. ","We are seeing growing customer interest in solutions that make packaging more recyclable such as the non-poly coated ice cream cartons, which enable these products to enter the fiber recycling stream. We see this interest in sustainable packaging solutions continuing to grow, over the past year, we\u2019ve generated $50 million in additional annual sales and we have the potential to increase this several times over. ","A great example of how we create innovative, sustainable packaging solutions for our customers are the projects that we have underway for Diageo, the owner of Guinness. We are transitioning their packaging from plastic to paper and are eliminating their use of shrink film and plastic rings. We are providing a better billboard for their product on the shelves which will give them the opportunity to grow their sales. ","This is a powerful combination and we are able to provide this turnkey solution for Diageo with the right substrate, right packaging design and our highly productive and flexible machinery that are working in concert to help Diageo achieve their environmental and financial goals. ","I\u2019ll now hand it over to Ward to discuss our outlook. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thanks, Steve. Turning to Slide 12, we outline our key assumptions for our fiscal third quarter guidance. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA in the third quarter to be between $830 million and $870 million as compared to $757 million in our second fiscal quarter and $754 million last year. ","Sequentially higher seasonal volumes across both segments should add $20 million to $40 million in EBITDA compared to our second quarter. We expect significant sequential cost deflation driven by declines in recycled fiber, seasonally lower energy cost, and some moderation in virgin fiber cost. ","We do not anticipate any business interruption insurance recoveries for the Panama City Mill until the fiscal fourth quarter. We estimate slightly higher depreciation and interest expense and a tax rate of 23.5% in our fiscal third quarter. ","These items impact the quarter by a negative $0.03. We are aligning our outlook to the recent changes in the containerboard market. For the full year, we now expect adjusted segment EBITDA of approximately $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. ","Turning to our balance sheet. We remain committed to returning to our long-term leverage ratio of 2.25 times to 2.5 times and expect our leverage ratio to be less than 2.9 times by fiscal year end 2019. We expect fiscal 2020 capital expenditures will decline to a level of $ 1 billion to $1.2 billion and that capital expenditures will be approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2021 as we complete our strategic capital projects. ","We remain committed to a stable and growing dividend, and our primary use of free cash flow near-term will be debt reduction. ","And now I will turn it back over to Steve for closing remarks. ","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. I am going to take a couple minutes and talk about where WestRock stands at this moment and time from an investor perspective, think of starts with markets, and I appreciate the concerns about global supply and demand. I will point out that there is other trends to consider, the most significant of which is that buyers of packaging are interested in much more than price. ","Our customers are interested in reducing their total cost across their entire supply chain, growing their sales, and minimize their risk by having a supplier that performs well day in and day out. And finally, achieving their sustainability objectives. ","Paper-based packaging is well situated to help customers achieve these goals. WestRock has the world\u2019s most comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging products and we are well positioned to help our customers succeed. We deliver value by creating customized, value-added solutions for our customers and our talented and engaged workforce is committed to delivering value for our customers and profitably growing our company. ","WestRock has multiple levers to improve our results. These levers include our commercial approach that supports organic growth. Our strategic capital projects and the capture of the KapStone synergies that will lower our cost. As is the case with many companies that have grown by acquisition, we are simplifying our business with systems and processes, and along the way building our capabilities to be successful in very competitive markets. ","As we do this, we are reducing our exposure to commodity markets and increasing the stability of our business by providing value-added products and services for our customers. While we are doing this, we are generating strong cash flow, and paying an attractive dividend. And we remain committed to returning our leverage to 2.25 to 2.5 times target. ","Before we turn to your questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Bob Feeser for his 32 years of service. ","Today is Bob\u2019s final day with WestRock. Bob, I appreciate your leadership and commitment to WestRock. We could not have integrated two companies into WestRock as well as we did without your presence and your passion. So, I thank you for all that you\u2019ve done and all of us at WestRock wish you ensure the best in the next phase of your life. ","And I am pleased to welcome Pat Lindner to WestRock as President of WestRock\u2019s Consumer Packaging business. Pat\u2019s 20 years of global business experience provides valuable perspectives to all of us at WestRock. Pat has got a proven history of being a strong driver of operational excellence, innovation and growth and we are fortunate to have him on our team. ","That concludes my prepared remarks. James, we are ready for Q&A.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience to give everyone a chance to ask a question, please limit your question to one with a follow-up as needed. We'll get to as many as time allows. Marcella, can we please take our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning everyone. Thanks for the details and Bob, all the best to you as you move forward. It looks like the CapEx guide for 2020 and 2021 is a little lower than what I think you had said in the past and yes, you are maintaining obviously the high profile projects you went through. Could you just tell us where you are finding some savings if I am correct to that assessment?","Ward Dickson","Chip, this is Ward. Thank you. Yes, you are correct. We are just balancing our capital investments with our current view of supply and demand conditions. And we are very focused on returning to our long-term leverage target of 2.25 to 2.5 times. ","We\u2019ve talked in the past about a maintenance CapEx level of $500 million ongoing return generating capital projects of approximately $500 million. We have flexibility to defer or scrub those two categories and that\u2019s what we are doing in the outlook. We are continuing to devote the capital required to complete the strategic capital projects on time because of the significant EBITDA generation opportunities that those represent. ","Chip Dillon","Okay. And a quick follow-up. This might be for Jeff, I am not sure, but, one of your big competitor is down in Brazil announced a major, the Puma project, the major expansion in kraft linerboard and the first of those expansion projects involves just only eucalyptus-based pulping which we always understood that hardwood was not really compatible with containerboard. Maybe there is a light weightness to this or something unique about this. If you could just help us understand what you think they are doing.","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Chip. I can say that, the technologies advanced with paper science, chemicals, fiber that you can make a - these and sheet in fact in our business in Brazil we are mixing eucalyptus along with wood fibers in making tremendous paper for that market and for our exports. So, I don\u2019t know what markets, where they are going to use the paper, but I think the science and with chemicals that the paper should be fine. I don\u2019t really know what else they are thinking of that. ","Chip Dillon","Okay. Thank you. ","Jeff Chalovich","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Your line is open. ","George Staphos ","Thanks for the details. Congratulations to Bob and Pat and everyone on their new roles. And I guess the first question that I had, to the extent that you can comment, what do you think was driving the recent industry weakness in box shipments recognizing that you did better in the last quarter and if you could sort of that parlay that into what are you seeing in terms of early fiscal third quarter trends, both in terms of your shipments and what customers are saying? And then I had a follow-on. ","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, George. It\u2019s Jeff. ","George Staphos ","Hey, Jeff. ","Jeff Chalovich","So, I can speak and articulate what we are seeing in our markets. As we reported, we\u2019re up 2% organically and 20% overall with KapStone. I think it\u2019s important to note the year-over-year comparisons still. So if you look at this quarter, last year it was a strong comp quarter and just give you some insight, sort of put your number two question. ","And what our customers are saying, they are our independent customers are saying they are flat, they may be a bit down, but they are coming off two record years and their view is bullish on the economy and what they are seeing in the marketplaces. So that\u2019s what their tone. What we see, our ecommerce business continues to grow at double-digits. ","We are strong in processed foods. Our ability to put innovation with our machinery business into multiple segments as along as to grow and I think has helped us the last 24 months grow the business because we are driving and answering critical customer challenges. That\u2019s in omni-channel. So, these are big CPG customers. ","They are looking to compete in box stores and retail stores and also in the ecommerce channels. We are uniquely positioned to provide solutions for that. And that\u2019s a sustainability or opportunity to drive cost out of their system and with a very good graphics business in the corrugated space paired with what we can do in our Display business and our Consumer business, we can hit all of the critical customer challenges. ","And that\u2019s continued to enable us to grow the business. We are up in April slightly year-over-year. We haven\u2019t finished yet. So, it\u2019s up a bit and it\u2019s another top comp. We are up 14% last year in the aggregate and over 3% on a per day basis. So, our box business remains solid and we will continue to grow organically in the business. ","George Staphos ","Okay. Thanks for the comments on that, Jeff. The related question, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you had 20 machine installations in the quarter. Can you help us sort of quantify that in terms of what kind of growth you are seeing year-on-year in terms of installations? ","Whether there is more of a shift towards consumer or to corrugated recognizing some cases it\u2019s marrying both. And I know you can\u2019t give a lot of detail on this, but is this helpful to your margin, helpful to your return or kind of average? Any thoughts on that would be great and thanks and good luck in the quarter. ","Jeff Chalovich","Thanks, George. I am going to let Pat answer on the 20. The 20 was Consumer and then I can \u2013 I\u2019ll let Bob on corrugated. ","George Staphos ","Okay. ","Patrick Lindner","Great. Thanks, George. Good morning. This is Pat. ","George Staphos ","Good morning, Pat. ","Patrick Lindner","Nice to join this call. Good morning. And so, yes, the 20 box shipments or machine shipments that we had really represent a nice increase over the last year. We expect that to continue into the rest of this year. What this really does is helps us add additional value to our customers at downstream, because obviously, we can not only bring our folding cartons\u2019 capability to and our box board capability to the customers, but also design that in a custom way into their solutions. ","And maybe one example of this is the one that Steve shared around Diageo, where we actually not only sold the board and helped them design the board, but we also helped install the machine and design that. And one of the reasons we won that piece of business was because that had much higher productivity than any other solution. ","And it\u2019s not clear how the outcome may have been different if we didn\u2019t have that machinery components to our offering. So, we really think when we look at our business, innovation and especially this plastics to paper conversions from design to material science with our paperboard substrates and then machinery, we think all of that is really important to our ability to serve our customers. ","Jeff Chalovich","And then, George I\u2019ll comment, we had 48 installations in the quarter and our automation platform continues to drive differentiation for us in volume growth. And paired with our Consumer business, and beverage is giving us unique opportunities and I\u2019ll give you an example. We had a large install, almost a $27 million project for a customer. ","So, it wraps up $50 million in sales for us. And we drove almost $3 million in cost out of their business. So we talk about quantifying value for the customers, we are able to do that with solutions. But it also gave our Consumer group a chance that over $40 million of business that we are looking at and we are looking at the Consumer business just not making machines for beverage, but moving into other machinery. ","Their platform is tremendous and so we are looking at doing a fully integrated install in this customer\u2019s business with an opportunity for the Consumer business also. We are also looking at new innovation in our BoxSizer and Box on Demand. So we came to market with a Pack on Demand pouch that we just rolled out at ProMat. ","So, it gives us an opportunity for a fully recyclable pouch and then if you look at our BoxSizer that we just acquired, we already have sold packaging into a retailer that had 15 SKUs who was looking to go to five SKUs, was looking at dim weight reductions, have been shipping to retailers but wanted to go to the direct in ecommerce. ","So when you talk about sustainability platform, it\u2019s still got all of the filler packs that this customer is using. It reduced their working capital, because their inventory went from 15 SKUs down to 5 and it drove our cost they had an automated solution. So, these are things that are continuing to drive organic growth for us and differentiating us in the marketplace to our customers and driving margins. ","George Staphos ","Okay, thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll turn it over. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is open. ","Anthony Pettinari ","Good morning and congratulations to Bob and Pat. On containerboard, you indicated in your comments that 10% of your total shipments are now export versus, I think 15% last year. Is 10% a good way to think about where you are early in fiscal 3Q? And then, we\u2019ve obviously seen a big deterioration of export prices, just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any kind of stabilization into the regions that you sell into? And sort of how you would characterize levels of inventory and supply demand from an export perspective?","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Anthony. It\u2019s Jeff. So, 10% I think is a good way. It may go up a few percent, down a few percent, but in general, 10% I think is a good way to think about our export. And then, if you break that down to the world, 60% of our 10% goes into the Latin America market which is more stable, more direct customers for us and the pricing has not been as pressured as the other areas of the world. 30% is Europe Mid East, Africa combined. ","And so what we\u2019ve seen in those markets has been some higher inventories, some pricing pressure and that chimes to that definitely higher inventory, some pressure on the pricing. However, what we are seeing now is, the volumes in our export is, or as we\u2019ve expected. So, we are seeing steady orders at least in the areas we participate. ","We\u2019ve had some areas, I\u2019ll call out Turkey, Israel, that are trying to lock-in prices for six months. Typically, that\u2019s a sign that they believe that the markets bottom and as they work down inventories, I would expect our business to stay stable on that market but much reduced. As you know, we\u2019ve done a lot of work integrating into a North American box business. So that\u2019s been part of the strategy and we\u2019ve been executing against that. ","Anthony Pettinari ","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just switching to the Consumer side, we\u2019ve seen this kind of divergence within SBS freights, cup stock stronger, folding carton is seeing a small price decline and pulp and paper weak. And then the delta between SBS and CNK is kind of \u2013 in terms of different priced than it has been historically. ","I was wondering, what\u2019s driving this? If you can kind of frame how it impacts your portfolio in terms of your mix between cup stock and folding cartons? And just sort of what you are seeing in those box board end-markets?","Patrick Lindner","Yes, thanks, Anthony. This is Pat. And so, the dynamics around the SBS and CNK pricing that\u2019s mentioned, of course, we cannot comment on the forward pricing dynamics that are out there in the industry. But I certainly can give you some perspective on what\u2019s happening in the markets. And I would like to focus most of this on CNK, because I think this is a pretty dynamic marketplace where we are seeing really strong demand for this product and it has really been driven by a number of things. ","In the beverage market it\u2019s been driven by the demand for wet and high strength applications. Beverage as well as frozen food and I think really capitalizing on the opportunity from plastics into the paper-based products. And so, we expect that demand to continue. I think, as Steve mentioned, we\u2019ve got $50 million or so of sales into that plastics to paper conversion. ","That\u2019s certainly driving strength. In CNK, we continue to have strong backlogs there. And we expect to get $100 million of sales this year in that type of a conversion again from plastics to paper and many more \u2013 many times over that going into the future. ","And I think the other thing around CNK that\u2019s pretty interesting right now is that the brown side of CNK is viewed by consumers as environmentally friendly. And again, adding to the strength that we see there. So, we are pretty bullish on what we see in CNK and we are also excited about having the Mahrt Mill back up and running with that big investment that we have there. ","And getting back to servicing our customers the highest level that we can. ","Anthony Pettinari ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Global. Your line is open. ","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. Just one detail question. The insurance recovery impact on EBITDA in the quarter, was that $60 million? ","Ward Dickson","Mark, this is Ward. Remember there are three categories of the insurance recoveries and the claim. We\u2019ve incurred M&R expense, just direct cost repair cost and those costs and those recoveries have been adjusted out of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. ","And then, the business interruption, the lost production volume and the lost profits, that has flowed through adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS and the recoveries have flowed through adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. And then finally, there is reimbursement for the capital investments. So, the total recovery was $60 million and that was in three buckets. ","A portion of it was devoted to the capital investment we have to replace the direct cost that we exclude from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS and then the business recovery for the business interruption losses. So the amount that flowed through adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was the recovery related to the business interruption claim. ","Mark Weintraub","Got it. And so that was the $3 million net income number?","Ward Dickson","Yes. ","Mark Weintraub","And so, can we assume it was roughly $40 million in terms of the EBITDA contribution?","Ward Dickson","It was $30 million of EBITDA we tax effected it to the \u2013 to get to the nine times.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Great. Super. Thank you. And how much more potentially could we be seeing from Panama City in Q4 that would flow through the EBITDA-adjusted number?","Ward Dickson","It would \u2013 we are envisioning an amount that\u2019s not that much different than what we experienced in the first half. The other thing, as you think of Panama City, as we ramp up the full production and we look at the second half versus the first half, we are actually incurring operating losses in the first half before the business recovery \u2013 business interruption recovery. ","And then, we saw those losses are reducing greatly in Q3 and then we returned to full operation as we move into Q4. ","Mark Weintraub","Great. Super helpful. And maybe one real quick follow through, if we were to look at KapStone pro forma, would the box shipments for the quarter still have been up for WestRock in total year-over-year?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, it\u2019s Jeff. Yes, so 2% year-over-year without KapStone. ","Mark Weintraub","And if we were to include KapStone, is it pretty close to that same number? Or does that actually move, I realize it\u2019s pretty small, think of it move the dial, but does it move the dial if we looked at what KapStone did last year, add that to what WestRock did last year, and then compare it to what WestRock did in total this year. Is it still pretty close to 2%?","Jeff Chalovich","We are going to need an abacus for that. So I am not quite \u2013 so, we are up 20% combined. I am not clear what their box shipments in the quarter were, but I know we were up 2% organically and with KapStone included, we are up 20%. ","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. ","Mark Connelly ","Steve, we\u2019ve seen WestRock and RockTenn respond to containerboard market and balances with higher exports, with plant closures and economic downtime. Can you help us understand how you think about those options with a bigger system with higher potential export potential? And with respect to downtime, has your approach to taking downtime shifted or you are thinking about it? You used to talk about your one mill as a swing mill. I am curious with the new system in with lower OCC whether that approach has changed.","Steve Voorhees","I think first on the downtime, we have a larger system. So we have more flexibility. We are continuing to match our production to meet customers\u2019 demand. Our system just gives a lot more flexibility. So, you really can\u2019t identify one mill as a swing mill. ","For the purchase of the market, we are \u2013 our approach is to focus on our customers and grow organically. I think the more we can sell boxes, the better and I think that\u2019s one of the key findings but it\u2019s really an advantage to KapStone\u2019s box plant system. We are able to have a broader platform to be able to do that. And I think it\u2019s contributed to the increase in our integration. ","Mark Connelly ","That\u2019s helpful. Just one more question. Working capital was a bigger use of cash than I expected. Can you help us understand why and where you think we might end up for the year on working capital?","Ward Dickson","Mark, this is Ward. So, seasonally, if you think about it, our first half versus second half, let me just step back and just talk about the total cash flow generation. If you look, there is a seasonal element of our cash flow generation. Last year, we generated approximately $1.7 billion or 69% of our full year adjusted operating cash flow in the second half, and this year is no different. ","We are projecting a similar level of cash flow generation in the first \u2013 in the second half of this year. And the key drivers really are higher EBITDA in the second half. And then working capital always shifts from a use in the first half to a source in the second half. We\u2019ve talked about the reduction in inventories. If you think about it in the first half of our year, we pay out our annual bonuses and then we start to accrue those bonuses as we go throughout the year. ","So the pattern that we see in the working capital model as we project our full year cash flow generation is really fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in previous years. ","Mark Connelly ","Very helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from Davidson. Your line is open. ","Steve Chercover ","Thanks. Good morning everyone. So, I want to start, first of all with the 6-Pack solutions, the EconoClip and Cluster-Pak, I mean, this seems to me a real trend now. And why did it suddenly become so urgent? Are you guys driving this or is it the beverage companies or the consumers? ","Patrick Lindner","Yes, Steve. This is Pat. And I think the short answer is it\u2019s really a lot of the consumer and as well as in turn the consumer packaging companies. And maybe a little bit of background that I have on this, from a personal side, I\u2019ve spent the last 20 years in the plastics industry and was in this industry in packaging in a number of different ways and as you know, there has been a lot of effort in the plastics industry around recyclability and compostability and making the products more environmentally friendly. ","But efforts have changed significantly and I would say, consumer preferences have changed significantly over the last couple of years and it was really kind of a tipping point or a turning point and what they are basically saying, consumers are basically saying is that, we don\u2019t want single-use plastics in our stream, in our consumer stream. ","And a lot of that is driven by some of the images probably out on social media. You can see the single use bottles floating in ocean and plastic bags in various places. And so, that\u2019s a big shift. And so, our customers are now coming to us asking for a solution. And we have a pretty broad array of solutions that we are bringing to them that capitalize on our capability around design, around material science. ","And it\u2019s not just the paperboard science, but also the coatings technology to make sure that these products meet the customers\u2019 needs and the application needs. And as we\u2019ve talked about and Jeff articulated nicely, the opportunities we have, the leverage our machinery capability there brings us \u2013 allows us to have a really \u2013 a holistic approach to this. ","So, EconoClip and Cluster-Pak, these are real options and real opportunities. They are being very much driven by end-user demand. ","Steve Chercover ","Well, congratulations on your shift from the dark side to the right side of histories. And sticking with the G had on plastic, the little box that you show on Slide 10, the EnShield Bakery Box, so is that \u2013 the see-through window, so, is that plastic or is that like a \u2013 would it be Cellophane?","Patrick Lindner","Yes, that is still plastic. And so, there is different solutions that we are looking at for that. But I would like to highlight some of those applications leverage what we call our EnShield technology. One of the challenges with replacing plastics is achieving the barrier property that they inherently have around grease and oil resistance and just general moisture resistance. ","And so, we\u2019ve developed recyclable, compostable, environmentally friendly products that are based in water, aqueous dispersions in coatings that we can put on these packages to render and achieve the same types of properties. ","So, we are pretty excited about EnShield and it\u2019s broad application really across all of our substrates. And we will continue to work with our customers wherever we can to replace plastics is driven by consumer demand. ","Steve Chercover ","Thanks. I have just one quick one on the box side. The 2% organic growth, is it odds with the industry stats. So, can you help us reconcile that? Are you gaining share? Or is there maybe something wrong with the statistics?","Steve Voorhees","I think we have been gaining share based on our ability to differentiate in the marketplace and providing solutions for customers that really add value and the things that Steve articulated earlier. We are helping them reduce the total cost in their supply chains. ","We are helping them activate brands and some more products through retail-ready, shelf-ready solutions on shelf displays, graphics in general, we have a naturally sustainable product and with the G hard you just mentioned on plastics, we are well positioned across our system to take advantage of that. ","And then we have scale that helps our customers manage risk when we go into change business or install machines to do full line integrations. The risk is much lower and it\u2019s easy to switch and it\u2019s easy to the users across North America, Brazil, Canada, Mexico. So, I think all of those things have helped our customers win and we are winning with them. ","Steve Chercover ","Great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Mark Wilde ","Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. ","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Mark.","Jeff Chalovich","Thanks. ","Mark Wilde ","I wanted to start, Jeff, if we could talk about, what looks like a little bit of a potentially a paradigm shift in the business where the corrugated business, where you\u2019ve got new entrants building large, converting plants and also mills that use a lot of low cost mixed waste. ","And I know a lot of people in the industry have been dismissive with this in the past, but at least one of these players is just steadily marching across the country building mills and building converting plants. ","Jeff Chalovich","I am sorry. What was the question?","Mark Wilde ","How do you think about? Is this a really a paradigm shift in the industry?","Jeff Chalovich","I can\u2019t say in the industry Mark. I think they have a player that they are running and what they are trying to do, I think from our standpoint what we are doing in WestRock is we are running offense in the things that we control and that we do. We have a great mix. So, one of the benefits of our system of our size, we have a good mix or recycled and virgin kraft liners - virgin kraft fiber. ","So, we are a balanced system and it gives us great flexibility in markets good and bad. And so, we like that position and we\u2019ve been delivered about how we\u2019ve gone about that. We are continuing to invest in our mill system that drive our cost, to the lower side of the cost curve. We\u2019ve built a very solid converting system and then combine our systems with our consumer display. ","We are unique in our industry. So I think that, we have continued to grow our business. We continue to add margin. So, I think we are well positioned and our customers are voting with purchase orders and organic growth for us. So, I think we are very well positioned in the market. ","As far as a paradigm shift in the industry, I can\u2019t speak to the whole industry. I know what we are doing and how we are executing and we will continue to integrate through our box plants and build a system that helps customers win in their marketplaces. ","Mark Wilde ","Okay. And then, I just for a follow-on, I just want to turn back to this machinery issue, because, a few months ago, you had a company sold at a very high multiple that had very higher margins just turning kind of kraft paper into dunnage inside packaging - for consumer packaging. ","And I am just curious, WestRock and KapStone have historically produced a lot of kraft paper. That market gets pretty rough in the down market. Just, what\u2019s \u2013 is there an opportunity for you to kind of replicate that strategy or replicate that kind of products going forward? Because it seems like that\u2019s where all the margin is in the business. ","Jeff Chalovich","That\u2019s a great question. We look at our machine platform broadly. I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time in those markets, but it\u2019s a great question and we will think more about that. But it\u2019s certainly as we look at machine platforms and opportunities, we\u2019ve looked at multiple spaces just like that.","Mark Wilde ","Okay. Good enough. Good luck in the quarter. ","Jeff Chalovich","Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Debbie Jones ","Thanks. Good morning. The first question I had was on Covington and cup factory. I just heard Anthony asked this part of the question earlier, but, if you are looking to giving to me, is there going to be a bit of an inflection point beyond what we\u2019ve already seen in demand for these grades, as is going to be strategic companies shift their way from these non-environmentally friendly applications? ","And which is reported by some of the things that you highlighted, but I was hoping that you could talk us to what your expectations over the next couple of years and then specifically how you are positioned on that?","Patrick Lindner","Yes, thanks, Debbie. This is Pat. And so, I think we are positioned really well across any one of these substrates. We are \u2013 one of the nice things about our portfolio is we are pretty agnostic as to which material or which substrate is actually used in, so across, CNK or CRB, URB, SBS. ","We really look to meet the customers\u2019 needs and they are going to be natural shifts based on what the customers are really looking for and we\u2019ve been able to make some of those shifts over the last couple of years and we will continue to do that as it makes sense. And maybe I can ask Bob make additional comments on this perspective.","Bob Feeser ","Hey, Debbie, it's Bob. Just related to cup market, specifically in food service, that continues to be a big trend. The shift away from foam, in particular and we are seeing high-single-digit growth in that part of the market and I would expect that to continue going forward, as more of those conversions happen. ","And clearly the innovation that we're bringing to the market by trying to remove plastic liners in cups is going to further accelerate that as well, that's why we're so excited about the work with the next-gen cup challenge as well and feel very good about the innovation that we're bringing to that market.","Debbie Jones ","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. It just it seems like with both McDonalds and Starbucks back in life it, they are quite curious about it. But it's so little confusing to me as to what the potential uptake is from that, but that's helpful. ","My second question just sticking with volumes in the Consumer segment, I think on the last call you did mention that you thought there would be an inflection at least in the volume bucket of the EBITDA bridge in the second half of the year, and I was just wondering if that's still the case.","Patrick Lindner ","Yes. So I think - this is Pat again, Debbie. So I think for the rest of the year, first of all, our volumes right now are about flat as you saw the top-line is up about 2%. That's really some of the price that that we are realizing from the price previously published price increases. So right now, we expect volume to be - it has been above flat. We may see some increases here. ","We are thinking the market in general, all in is about 1% to 2% CAGR and we are kind of still holding with that point of view. We've got some things that are improving and increasing. We've got some strength in food service. We've certainly got some strength in healthcare with our NPS portfolio and cosmetics in the beauty segments as well. ","But as you know, there is things offsetting that such as the some of the secular decline that's been going on in tobacco and to maybe a lesser extent commercial print. And so, we are probably looking at similar to what we had before. We are looking at overall probably 1% to 2% on our general volume growth for this business all in.","Bob Feeser ","Yes. Hey, Debbie, it's Bob. Just a quick follow-up on that. We will see some normal seasonal strength in the second half of the year. And then also, it's important to remember to our volumes in the first half of the year have been a bit muted, because of the big strategic outages that we've taken in the mills. So in the fourth quarter, that will be behind us. The facilities will be running full. So, we should see some modest growth in the fourth quarter.","Debbie Jones ","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Can I just squeeze in one more, I wonder if you can update on Grupo Gondi in trends in Mexico. If you could just comment on what you're seeing there and what the expectation is?","Jeff Chalovich ","So, we continue to partner with Grupo in Mexico. Their business is solid, our exports to them and to Mexico have remained solid. So in general, the market conditions remains strong. It\u2019s a great business. They continue to invest \u2013 the mill project is well underway. ","They continue to build world-class box plants and continue to grow their business organically. And so, in general, the relationship is strong. Their business is strong. And then I think the opportunity to continue to partner with them with customers in North America is solid.","Debbie Jones ","Okay, thanks, Jeff. I'll turn it over.","Jeff Chalovich ","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Gabe Hajde ","Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions. One, could you discuss what's going on in the non-containerboard pieces of the KapStone business? There is a little less visibility with respect to sort of supply demand and\/or pricing trends, particularly kind of talking about the extensible kraft grades and what you are seeing with demand and pricing there?","Jeff Chalovich ","Sure. In general, the kraft markets are a bit challenged, not significantly like a containerboard pricing is good. And then, I think the extensible markets, I'll talk specifically for us on some of the saturated. So there's kraft extents when saturated, there is large opportunities on the saturated side for us. We have opportunities to grow that market. ","The compound annual growth rate is pegged to be between 5% and 7%. So we think there is opportunities to expand in that market where there is not a lot of players across the globe. The segment for us has been steady. Again, there is some challenge in the pricing. ","But we have locked up some of our large customers and longer-term contracts. And then the extensible market, that's not much different than our kraft market. So, in general, that's that business is fine.","Gabe Hajde ","Okay. And shifting gears a little bit, historically, I think the industry and at least WestRock has talked about box is performing to a spec as opposed to the specific linerboard or medium that goes into on whether it's a recycled or kraft content. Given where recycled fiber costs are, have you had any sort of influx of customers asking for more recycled boxes or anything like that just on the margin?","Jeff Chalovich ","No, Gabe, I think you articulated well upfront. So what we have basically across our box customers is a request for performance-based specs. So they want us to build a box that suited for how they use it and the conditions that go into DCs and warehouses. So we are building a box to the spec. The quality of our paper products across our mill system. ","Whether that's recycled or virgin, we are using liners that are recycled or virgin and applications that meet our customers\u2019 demands. So, we could do that with a 42-pound virgin kraft liner or 42-pound recycled liner same thing with high performance liner. So, either ECT values or performance-based specs or what our customers are moving to and we are well positioned to meet that demand.","Gabe Hajde ","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Gaffner ","Thanks, good morning and congrats Bob and Pat on the changes.","Bob Feeser ","Thanks.","Scott Gaffner ","I just wanted to talk a minute, go back to the some of these new products that you mentioned, Cluster-pak and EconoClip. I was hoping, maybe you could help us out a little bit with the addressable market there, just given the fact that a lot of the market as you mentioned is in plastic rings today. ","I know there is some customers that are agnostic to price especially some of the premium customers you mentioned, but how should we think about the addressable market there for, say paper versus plastic on those types of applications?","Patrick Lindner ","Yes, thanks Scott. This is Pat for the question, really appreciate it. I think there are a lot of markets that could really capitalize on this. And maybe I'll start with Europe. The plastics challenges that have been out there were \u2013 I think they are probably most acute and most are first really recognized in Europe and so we have seen a number of customers come to us and ask for solutions and as quickly as we can deliver them. ","And that's particularly in the beverage market, but also in the healthcare market - there is this, as well as cosmetics and beauty there is this initiative that P&G is very involved we call it Ecopush, which is another example on a very different market beauty and cosmetics where they are trying to get rid of any type of container that is environmentally unfriendly and so plastic certainly fit into that. ","And so, when you specifically think about the addressable market, it's really hard to put an exact figure on. We've kind of thought that - as we said, we've got maybe $100 million worth of sales into that conversion expected this year. We are certainly well on track for that. As far as where is it goes from here, we've talked about and I think talked in the past about maybe $400 million of sales. ","But we are not sure that that's represents the entire market as we go global with this conversion. So, somewhere in the neighborhood of north of 50,000 tons, could be 70,000 tons, somewhere in that neighborhood is kind of what we're \u2013 it\u2019s kind of what we are projecting. But we are really bullish on it. We are really excited about it and the number of applications that we have continue to increase.","Scott Gaffner ","Understandably, thanks for the detail there. Jeff, if we just look at the box shipments in 1Q, I mean, you mentioned the tough comps. But we did know about the tough comps maybe coming into the quarter. Clearly, things downshifted a little bit in 1Q. ","Is there anything outside of weather that you are seeing, whether it's the KapStone business in the Pacific Northwest, where they are shipping not just actual containerboard, but shipping boxes to customers in the region where you've seen a slowdown, or anything regionally or end market-wise that you could point to outside of the weather for the slowdown in 1Q box shipments relative to expectations?","Jeff Chalovich ","So from our standpoint, we are not \u2013 we are up. So I'll start with that. If you are talking about what we are seeing industry-wise, but we are not, we are up 2% organically and 20% total. So our shipments continue to grow. There are some regional challenges. The West Coast is challenged in Ag. It's off to a slower start, but we see a pickup there. ","I think the sheet feeder business in the country has had some weakness. But in general, I think the biggest industry-wide one is Ag. That's been slower start. That's been really weather and then of course you had a bunch of weather events in Q1 that was hurting the overall shipments I think.","Scott Gaffner ","Okay, fair enough. Just lastly, $150 million EBITDA reduction at the midpoint of the guidance then, if volumes are kind of as expected. Is it more just external shipments whether that's export pricing, et cetera, if you could just sort of bridge the old to the new, what were the buckets that really moved? appreciate it and good luck in the quarter.","Ward Dickson ","Hey, Scott, this is Ward. So, our current guidance range reflects potentially lower volumes to our both domestic and export containerboard and lower volumes relative to our previous expectations on the kraft side as well. We've also flowed through the impact of the $10 per ton published price decrease for the balance of the year. ","Now, we have had some benefits and lower recycled fiber. But as we talked about, we had elevated virgin fiber and energy costs in Q2. Although, we are seeing moderation in second half, it's moderating from a higher point. And then we've taken, we've highlighted the downtime that we've taken in the month of April.","Our full-year outlook for the Consumer business is really largely unchanged. So the primary drivers have been a reflection of the supply demand conditions that we've seen in Corrugated. And beside all of that, we are still focused on all the things that are in our control. We are executing the strategic capital projects. We are focused on capturing the synergies and completing the integration of KapStone. So, we feel good about how we are performing in these conditions.","Scott Gaffner ","Thanks, Ward.","James Armstrong ","Thank you and thank you to our audience for joining our call today. As always, reach out to us if you have any questions. We are always happy to help. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I would now like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","James Armstrong","Thank you, Jake. Good morning. And thank you for joining our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. We issued our press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our Web site. The release and presentation can be accessed at ir.westrock.com, or via a link on the right side of the application you are using to view this webcast.","With me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; our Chief Financial Officer, Ward Dickson; our Chief Commercial Officer and President of Corrugated Packaging, Jeff Chalovich; as well as our Chief Innovation Officer and President of Consumer Packaging, Pat Lindner. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discussed during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filing with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call.","We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. As mentioned previously, the slide presentation is available on our Web site.","With that said, I'll now turn it over to you Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, James. Good morning. Thanks for joining our fiscal fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. It's been an eventful year at WestRock, and I'm proud of all that our teams accomplished. During the past fiscal year, we've completed the KapStone acquisition and we've made substantial progress on the integration in the strategic capital projects that we have underway. We've delivered solid operating performance, including generating over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the fourth consecutive year since we formed WestRock.","In this morning, we announced that we're increasing our dividend by 2.2% to $1.86 per share on an annualized basis. The increase demonstrates our confidence in our ongoing ability to generate strong cash flow for the long-term. As many of you know, WestRock's vision is to be the premier partner and unrivaled provider of winning solutions for our customers. Our performance in fiscal '19 advanced our progress toward achieving our vision. We have the advantages of the industry's broadest portfolio of sustainable fiber-based paper and packaging solutions combined with an organization that's becoming increasingly successful at delivering the customized value-added solutions that help our customers win in their markets.","As an example, since July of 2018, our sales of plastic replacement solutions have generated a run rate of more than $100 million in annual sales. For the entire fiscal year '19, net sales of $18.3 billion were 15% higher year-over-year, excluding prior year recycling sales. Fiscal '19 was marked by several key achievements. We grew our North American box segments by 18% from 80 billion square feet to 94 billion square feet.","And while most of the increase was due to the KapStone acquisition, we still grew our organic daily box shipments by 2.5% in fiscal year 2019. And this compares to the industry growth rate for the same period of 0.5, or 0.5%. We grew our enterprise sales where customers buy more than $1 million annually from each segment to $7.3 billion. More than 150 customers are realizing and appreciating the value of our diverse differentiated portfolio.","We generated $2.4 billion in adjusted operating cash flow, and we use that cash flow to invest more than $1.3 billion in capital, including our strategic capital projects. We returned more than $550 million to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. We've paid down $757 million in debt since the end of the first fiscal quarter, and we remain focused on returning to 2.25 to 2.5 times leverage target.","Let's turn to the fourth fiscal quarter. Our sales were more than $4.6 billion, up 13% compared to the same quarter of last year, also excluding prior year recycling sales. Our adjusted segment EBITDA margins were 19%. Our Corrugated Packaging adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 22% remain strong despite the softer year-over-year market conditions. North American Corrugated Packaging adjusted segment EBITDA margins were 23%. Our consumer packaging business reported EBITDA margins of 16.1%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. We grew converting shipments and implemented previously published price increases for paperboard.","Our adjusted segment EBITDA increased $89 million or 11% year-over-year. The KapStone acquisition, lower inflation and productivity improvements, contributed to this EBITDA growth, which was partially offset by lower volumes, a pass through of previously published price changes and lower prices for pulp export containerboard and craft paper.","Now to our Corrugated Packaging segment. Our adjusted segment EBITDA increased 14% year-over-year. Adjusted segment EBITDA margins in North America of 23% represented another outstanding performance by WestRock's Corrugated Packaging team","The flow through, previously published price reductions for containerboard and craft paper, lower pole prices and weakness in export prices, negatively impacted EBITDA during the quarter. However, the negative EBITDA impact from declines in volume and pricing was more than offset by the inclusion of KapStone and our results, as well as lower cost and productivity improvements. Given the softer supply and demand environment for containerboard, we matched our production with our customers' demand. During the quarter, we took 97,000 tons of economic downtime and an additional 34,000 tons of maintenance downtime.","We saw growth in many of our end markets, including agriculture, bakery, e-commerce, pizza, protein and retail. Our broad based strength in these end markets was slightly offset by lower margin business that we exited, and also by lower year-over-year external containerboard and craft-paper shipments, excluding KapStone. Our integration rate for the year was 77%, and we\u2019re targeting long-term integration rate of 90%.","For the month of October, our daily box increased by 1.8% over the last year. During the month of October, the combination of the increase in the box demand over last year, stronger than expected demand from domestic and export customers and our scheduled maintenance downtime, allowed us to operate our systems with no economic downtime, while reducing our inventories by 36,000 tons.","For the entire December quarter, we scheduled 131,000 tons of maintenance downtime. This includes 65,000 tons of downtime for the outage now underway at our Florence mill. This outage is taking place, while we\u2019re executing our project to replace our three older paper machine with a new modern paper machine. After we complete the outage later this month, we want to start up one of the three older paper machines that has capacity of 15,000 tons a month. We expect to start up the new paper machine in the spring of 2020.","The strength of WestRock's differentiated product portfolio shows up in our results. We distinguish ourselves with high quality board and design, and consistent delivery of value for our customers, including the value we deliver through our machinery offerings. Our platform includes a scaled footprint with a broad portfolio of products and services. Our platform, combined with our commercial approach, supports our ability to meet the needs of thousands of local, regional, national and global customers and helps to explain how we\u2019ve been able to sustain above market organic growth rates and attractive EBITDA margins.","In Consumer Packaging, adjusted segment EBITDA margins grew 100 basis points on lower revenue. Year-over-year, pricing improvements, lower energy, material and freight costs and productivity improvements, were only partially offset by lower volumes, lower pulp prices and wage inflation. In addition, volumes were lower year-over-year as slight growth in converting shipments was more than offset by lower paperboard shipments, primarily due to the restoration of inventory following the strategic outages at Mahrt and Covington.","Currently, backlogs and all of our grades are at levels that we expect during this time of year with SBS, CNK and CRB backlogs in the range of three to six weeks. We've just begun to tap the full potential of our broad fiber based packaging portfolio. Since 2016, sales from customers that buy more than $1 million per year from each segment have grown by approximately $2.5 billion or roughly 50%.","As the market realizes the value of our differentiated portfolio and the ability to deliver the right fiber-based solution, regardless of the substrate, we expect further sales opportunities and growth. We're optimizing our system to reduce cost. We're investing in a number of strategic projects that will drive cost savings and efficiencies throughout the system.","We expect to realize more than $240 million a year in incremental EBITDA from these initiatives. I'm excited to see each of these projects come to fruition and especially enthusiastic about our new box plant in Porto Feliz. I attended the opening last month this box plant's well-equipped with the capacity produce about 5 billion square feet each year. We also operate the first preprint machine in South America. Our Porto Feliz has an amazing workforce that is highly capable has the expertise to deliver high-quality packaging to a wide variety of customers.","We're realizing the synergies from the KapStone acquisition. Through the fourth quarter, we've realized $90 million in annualized synergies and are on schedule to achieve more than $200 million by the end of fiscal year '21. We've internalized 100,000 tons of annualized shipments to our Victory Packaging system, and now supply 250,000 tons to Victory.","Asset optimization is another lever of EBITDA improvement to drive costs out of our system. In September, we announced the North Charleston mill reconfiguration that will reduce linerboard capacity by 288,000 tons. And once completed in the spring of 2020, will eliminate $40 million of annual cost.","Now let's talk about sustainability. Our customers are embracing the increasing desire for sustainable packaging solutions. They are setting aspirational short-term and long-term goal for increasing their use of packaging that\u2019s recyclable, reusable and\/or compostable. Fiber-based packaging is especially well positioned, because it's made from either recycled fiber or virgin fiber that's been sourced from sustainable forest.","Our team at WestRock is enthused about working with our customers to help them meet their sustainability goals by creating customized alternatives using WestRock's differentiated portfolio of Corrugated Packaging, Consumer Packaging and machinery solutions. We've been successful doing this. And so far since July of '18 we've increased our annual run rate of sales by $100 million by replacing plastic in a wide variety of use cases. The largest market today has been food and food service where we've replaced plastic with our paperboard, clamshell and folding carton solutions, perfect for dine-in, carry out and delivery use.","In beverage, we've replaced shrink wrap, our Cluster-Pak paperboard solution, and used our CanCollar paperboard rings to replace plastic rings for dozens of customers. Our machinery makes the transition to paperwork solutions easy and cost-effective for our customers. We're frequently asked what the addressable market is for plastic reprising.","While it's difficult to estimate exactly, we believe the addressable market is at least $5 billion. Importantly, the addressable market is expanding as consumers demand more sustainable packaging. We\u2019re working with our customers to innovate to develop more fiber based packaging opportunities. WestRock\u2019s designed paperboard science and machinery capabilities position us for continued opportunities to work with customers to develop even more sustainable fiber based packaging application.","Many customers regularly tell us that labor efficiencies and the need for improved productivity are among their biggest challenges. Our machinery solutions address these issues for all types of businesses. We provide solutions that best fit our customers' needs. Often when customers are just starting out with us, we can instantly boost their productivity by supplying them with a simple case erector or case sealer.","Further, we can help even the largest operations that use their footprint more efficiently by designing turnkey solutions for both primary and secondary packaging, and increasing throughput without additional labor or expansion cost. Approximately 35% of our corrugated packaging sales are to customers that use WestRock\u2019s machinery solutions. Our machinery replacements keep growing. We typically have longer-term contracts and stable demand for machinery customers that appreciate the service and innovative solutions that we've developed.","One new machinery solution that we've recently developed is our Pak On Demand pouch system. Consumers have begun pushing back against single use plastics, including plastic bubble mailers. Through Pak On Demand pouches, we\u2019re able to make custom sized corrugated pouches that help our customers eliminate the use of single use plastic.","The Pak On Demand system helps lower labor cost and reduces or eliminates board fill. The pouches help our customers grow their sales and improve productivity, while providing the recyclable packaging experience consumers demand. Pak On Demand demonstrates how our machinery offerings help drive supply chain efficiency and often meets new sustainability goals for our customers. WestRock create solutions that solve our customers' critical challenges helping them lower their cost, grow their sales, improve their sustainability and minimize the risk. This creates value for our customers.","The first alert Packaging story, as a current example, have WestRock's enterprise approach is helping our customers solve their critical challenges. First Alert started with a complex supply chain with more than a 150 SKUs and the challenge of creating a sustainable package that provides an improved customer experience. We also needed to keep the same footprint and reduce the cost of access of tooling changeovers. Solving for this complexity and creating a sustainable packaging solution, that's the type of challenge of WestRock team loves to solve.","WestRock team reduced the SKUs into three common cards sizes and 13 common blister cards using our NatraLock paperboard. We converted the paperboard, provided to clear blister shell and provided the machines to heat seal the new and improved package. WestRock won the sustainable Packaging Award for this package from the paperboard packaging Counsel.","This award highlighted the 61% reduction of plastic in the packaging and the 36% reduction in packaged weight. This was one of only 13 awards from the Paperboard Packaging Counsel that we received with the most in the industry and a very positive reflection on the performance of our highly capable team. We're providing sustainable packaging solutions that create value for our customers every day.","Now I will turn it over to Ward to discuss our full year and first quarter FY ' 20 outlook. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. On slide 15, we outlined our fiscal year 2020 guidance. We expect net sales to be between $18 billion and $18.5 billion. This guidance reflects the flow through of previously published declines in North American container board and craft paper index pricing, and the full year impact of market pricing declines that we've experienced in export container board, craft paper and market pulp. Offsetting these declines is an additional month of KapStone sales, as well as forecasted growth in our corrugated box volumes in North America and Brazil, and the increased volumes in our Consumer Packaging business.","Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion. The key assumptions include the impact of pricing declines that I just mentioned, and our ongoing inflation in wages, benefits and other non-commodity cost categories. We anticipate commodity deflation, especially in recycled fiber. We will also experience some operational impact in our mill system from the Florence and Tr\u00eas Barras upgrade projects.","We also expect productivity improvements during the fiscal year of more than $200 million. We have provided an adjusted EBITDA guidance range to reflect the potential variability of our key assumptions around volume, pricing and input costs. Our earnings pattern will reflect typical seasonality and is directly impacted by the timing of maintenance outages and our strategic capital projects.","We project that approximately 45% of our adjusted EBITDA will be generated in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half of the year. One of the strengths of WestRock is our significant cash flow generation. We project adjusted free cash flow to be more than $1 billion for the fifth consecutive year. Adjusted operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $2.1 billion. We anticipate a higher cash tax rate and increased working capital usage during the year.","As we have shared previously, we will invest $1.1 billion in capital expenditures to maintain and improve our mill and converting systems, including $275 million for our strategic projects in Florence and Tr\u00eas Barras. As we complete these projects, we anticipate that we will return to 900 million to $1 billion annual capital investment level in fiscal year 2021. In the appendix, we have provided additional details that should help you complete your models.","Turning to Slide 16. We detail the key assumptions included in our first fiscal quarter 2020 guidance. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA in the first quarter to be between $670 million and $690 million as compared to $733 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Some of the current analyst models for our first quarter of fiscal 2020 do not account for the earnings seasonality that I mentioned earlier.","Walking through the year-over year bridge, we expect higher volumes to add $40 to $50 million of adjusted segment EBITDA, as we include a full quarter of KapStone in our results, given the November close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. We expect price and mix to negatively impact results by approximately $110 million. The pass through of previously published container board pricing, lower export and craft paper prices, will be partially offset by the benefit of the previously published indexed price increases in our Consumer Packaging business.","Pulp prices are down globally and we anticipate a negative year-over-year impact of approximately $30 to $35 million. Finally, we expect $42 million to $47 million improvement over the prior year quarter as lower commodity cost productivity improvements more than offset higher scheduled maintenance outages of 170,000 tons. This is 103,000 tons higher than the prior year quarter. And as you would expect this also includes a higher year-over-year wage and healthcare cost. We have provided additional items to assist you with completing your models for the first quarter. And now I'll turn it back to Steve for closing remarks.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. WestRock team is performing well as we proactively respond to a challenging industry environment. We're seeing increasing opportunities in the market for sustainable packaging, e-commerce and value-added packaging solutions. We're taking advantage of these opportunities in several ways. We're growing organically by creating customized value added solutions for our customers that support their need to grow their sales, reduce their total cost and risk, all while helping them achieve their sustainability goals.","We're investing in our business and in our people for the long term to sustain and expand our competitive advantage. We're building our systems and processes to take advantage of the scale of our platform. We're using digital technology to enhance our customer experience, improve our operating efficiency and better engage our team mates. We're moving from a period of growth by acquisition and investment in large strategic projects to a period of increased focus on organic growth, sustainability, innovation, productivity and free cash flow generation, a combination that will create value for our customers, stockholders and teammates for the long term.","That concludes my prepared remarks. James, we're ready for Q&A.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience to give everyone a chance to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question. We'll get to as many as time allows. Operator, can we please take our first question","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport global.","Mark Weintraub","I was hoping just to understand the walk through to the free cash flow number. And perhaps it's the fact that you're saying its $1 billion plus, and that gives plenty of scope as to what the plus could be. But if we look at the EBITDA and we back out the CapEx and we know the cash tax rate is at 21%. I come up with something north of $1.3 billion on the free cash flow, which would seem to be providing quite a bit of room for either working capital build or something else going on. Any color along those lines would be great.","Ward Dickson","Mark, this is Ward. So you're right. You read key components of the guidance correctly. So the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA range is $3.1 billion cash interest will be around $400 million. The cash tax rates rises from 17% to 21%. We did say in my comments that we expected a modest increase in working capital so there'll be some normal seasonal fluctuations as we go through our maintenance outages and execute the strategic capital projects. In addition, part of the strong performance that we had in Q4, there was some timing of, we had a very strong cash collections quarter in Q4. There was some amount of that was timing Q4 versus Q1 and then we also mentioned that we're rebuilding our inventory levels and consumer as we came out of the strategic outages.","We will be focused on driving free cash flow generation, we did say more than $1 billion and we'll be focused on inventory reductions as we go through the year and also on expanding our supply chain, financing and payables to balance the exposure that we have with our customers as they push for extended terms. So we feel very confident in this guidance and we said more than $1 billion there is implied a small working capital build and we are going to strive to minimize that.","Mark Weintraub","And just one other quick one, if I could. Previously you talked about the strategic investments generating about $50 million of EBITDA, the year just ended and additional $65 million in fiscal '20 and then additional $70 million in '21, and additional $90 million in '22. Are those still the types of numbers that are embedded in the guidance you provided for '20? And you did also mention that there would be some costs related, for instance the Florence, et cetera. Could you give us a sense as to transitional costs would be in '20 offsetting some of the benefits that we get from the projects?","Ward Dickson","So again, Mark, you read my comments correctly. The achievement of the returns from the strategic capital projects is still in line with what we previously disclosed. What we've said with the major outage that we'll have Tr\u00eas Barrasas and as we get prepared for the transition in Florence, the negative impact of those two items will be between $35 million and $50 million in the year. So in this year, it offsets some of the benefits as we prepare to complete those projects.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical.","Chip Dillon","My question has to do with -- you mentioned about 35% of sales now, maybe 40% to customers that buy both, folding cartons and paperboard, and container board and boxes. And if you could talk about where you're finding synergies or those customers are finding synergies, other than say just pricing. Is there another reason you're seeing such overlap?","Jeff Chalovich","Chip, good morning, it's Jeff. We are seeing value and our customers are finding value in the broad portfolio of offerings, simplicity of doing business with one group, we have enterprise account leads with our top accounts. And if you look at our top 200 or 210 customers, we do about $10 billion in those. And some of those we have, we mentioned 152 of them we do over $1 million each. And then some of them are large customers we don't have quite over $1 million each, but there's about $15 billion of fiber-based packaging in those 210 customers. And we think about eight or nine of that is addressable for us in our space. And we built account teams, account plans to look and grow that business organically by solving those critical customer challenges through the supply chain.","If you look at our surveys from our customers, our customers, whether the consumer or on the corrugated side, tell us help us with the supply chain optimization. So that's total cost take out and we can best do that across the platform with the folding consumer Corrugated business, and then automation with machines. The second is sustainability and you saw we presented today. So we have a sustainable product. We pair that with process and automation that takes out fiber and optimizes the packaging together. They're asking for channel help, brand help. And so with our capabilities across the business and one place to go for that, we're finding synergies for our customers that they value and that's helping fuel our growth.","Chip Dillon","And then just one quick follow-up. I think Ward mentioned $30 million to $50 million in start-up costs I'll call them for all the projects that start up in fiscal '20. Do those largely go away in fiscal ' 21 or how should we see those eventually dissipate?","Ward Dickson","Chip, this is Ward. So we will largely be through the strategic capital projects. We'll have just a small tail with Tr\u00eas Barras as we move into fiscal 2021, and then the benefits from all of the projects will start to ramp up as we complete fiscal '20 and get into '21.","Chip Dillon","So said differently, you're not only going to get a benefit in '21 and '22 from Florence, which I think you've said was somewhere around $70 million but you're on top of that, you'll have a reversal of these costs. Is that right?","Ward Dickson","That's right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from George Staphos with Bank of America.","George Staphos","Thanks for all the details, as always. I wanted to continue on the questioning on systems and cross-selling and machinery, and maybe kind of a quick first one and then a longer follow on. Jeff, can you comment how many machine installations do you have currently at customer periodically, you gave us that figure just would be helpful. I remember the last number being somewhere in the range of 3,000. But if you could give us a quick update on that that'd be great.","Jeff Chalovich","So George, we have about 3,675 roughly, so between 3,600 to 3,700 deployed, across the system and customers, and the APS sales this year are up about 40%. So strong year helping us grow organically and differentiating us to our customers helping them solve those critical challenge across our platform and we're up 4% as a system across the whole machine platform and consumer and corrugated.","George Staphos","My other question, taking a step back, you talk about, and you're seeing it in total, a benefit from cross selling between corrugated and consumer and you also talk about the benefits that you're getting from sustainability across the platform. It strikes me though. Just looking at the volume numbers that corrugated might be getting a bigger lift from both. So differently said consumer volume was only up slightly on a converted basis but given the cross-sell opportunity from corrugated given the benefit that you should be getting from sustainability, should we be seeing perhaps a stronger volume growth number in Consumer on a converted basis? If so, what's been the headwind, if you will there? Thank you and good luck in the quarter.","Pat Lindner","This is Pat Lindner. Yes, it's a bit and so the consumer volumes as you noted in the quarter were down overall and the converting volumes were up and they were up actually year-over-year quite significantly and are in the 4% to 5% range. The challenge we had in the 4th quarter around volumes really wasn't related to cross selling. It really was related to is what Steve mentioned in more mentioned around restoring our inventory levels, primarily in SBS as well as in C&K from the strategic outages. And just to give you an idea of that when you look at fiscal year ' 19, overall production across all of our paperboard grades or was about 60,000 tons less than in fiscal year ' 18 and that was really because of our strategic outages. So we're obviously now coming out of that in the first quarter here.","Our fiscal first quarter, we're building our inventories back so we can capture some of that growth, but we see tremendous demand in consumer and corrugated across the whole enterprise. We see tremendous demand driven by sustainability and plastics replacement and we're going to continue to capture that as our ability to supply restores to normal levels.","George Staphos","I thought you had said converted was up slightly, but that explains it. Thank you very much.","James Armstrong","Just to remind everybody, we would like to limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many questions as possible. Operator, can we go to our next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Chercover with D. A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover","So a few quarters ago the hot topic was Amazon rightsizing packaging. I think they referred to it is frustration free, but have you really felt an impact on volumes? I mean I assume this is very good for pack on-Demand, but how about for your overall system?","Jeff Chalovich","So we've seen no degradation from that I think this gives us an opportunity again to help solve critical challenges, so the frustration pre-package is really the packaged experience of the opening and then the, as you mentioned the pack on Demand our box size or our automation platform in general help to right size the package, so that you take out waste, number one, it can reduce the fiber, so if you think of a mandrel formed carton; you can take up to 30% of the fiber up good sustainable solution and you can run multiple packages on a machine, which is the tooling change.","Box size, that we just invested in helps multiple footprints and you can right size the package and get rid of all the internal peanuts, plastics, all things that you have to throw away and can't be recycled and then as you mentioned our pack on Demand gives us an opportunity to get rid of some of these plastic packaging envelopes that are not recyclable and we've put out a machine we just introduced PMI and sold two. We had one built as a beta machine we sold 2 off the floor because of the appeal of number one , the optionality of size and that its 100% curbside recycling. So we're not seeing a degradation, we see this as an opportunity to solve problems for customers and their supply chain in the e-commerce channel, including for folks like Amazon.","Steven Chercover","And this is related, I know that in consumer your key competitor does have machinery but I don't think you other competitors in corrugated really talking about the machinery like you do. That's your knowledge, do they have these capabilities?","Jeff Chalovich","We're the only Corrugated manufacturer that builds machinery. I think some others can place they may make agreements with outside vendors, but we have a full machine business where we build, we work with OEM suppliers so our platform is very well established and it is different than our other competitors. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead, sir.","Anthony Pettinari","I was wondering if you could provide any more detail on backlogs for the 3 boxboard grades, I think you cited 3 to 6 weeks, which is somewhat wide range and then just maybe following up on George's question you've articulated and integration target for the corrugated business. I'm just wondering if you have a similar target for consumer or any of the three grades within consumer given you seem to have a lot of these Sustainability opportunities on the consumer side as well.","Pat Lindner","This is Pat. Good morning. So let me talk about the backlogs. First is your first question. So as you've seen in some of the published industry statistics, some of the backlogs have come down and with some seasonal softness. This is typical of what's happened over the last three or four years, so CRB is down around 3 And SBS might be around three or four weeks of backlog. C&K isn't published and we think those are really in the normal typical range across the industry, so we see typical activity.","Now our situation, as I mentioned in the one of my prior answers the situation is a little bit different primarily on SBS so CRB and C&K or in the normal ranges for us kind of three to four weeks at that lower end of what we shared SBS is a little bit different to the higher end and that's generally in the area of four to six weeks. The reason for that is really attributable to the strategic outages that we had, that I mentioned before and the reduced availability of capacity and volume to sell in some of our, some of our markets so our SBS backlogs continue to be longer or a little bit longer than what the industry is publishing.","We expect to catch up on some of that although in the first quarter, we do have a high number of maintenance outages that we we're not able to complete in fiscal year '19 and so we'll continue through this fiscal quarter to continue to restore all those inventories and naturally we want to serve our customers to the best of our ability and bring those backlogs down so we can, serve them in the shortest time possible when they place the demand. Relating to your second question around integration, we think about integration in really 2 different parts. Number one is around specialty applications and this is really around three primary market segments of tobacco, commercial and liquid packaging.","These are all SBS product or markets we serve those with SBS and in each one of those were specified downstream in there really to the end user and that's about 40% of our total SBS that we sell. So we consider that to be integrated through those specialty applications. When you look at food, food service beverage and healthcare and some of the other areas where we're integrated by converting the paperboard in our converting facilities, SBS assets at about 20% C&K at 70 and CRB at about 60% and our view of integration really hasn't changed that much.","We generally view integration as a positive, especially as we get close to our end user customers and sustainability and sustainable packaging and plastics replacement. So it's generally a positive and we'll continue to look for ways attractive ways to increase our integration levels, but at the same time, our open market paperboard sales in those segments is very important to us.","Many of our customers service local, regional markets that are assets in our sales forces, are not as adapt at serving are capable of serving. So we see this nice mix of integration where we'll continue to look to improve and increase our integration level combined with accessing the open market paperboard sales is a really healthy and nice combination.","Anthony Pettinari","And then just a quick one on Corrugated if I could, one of your large competitors has talked about stabilization or maybe even a little inflection and export market conditions in October. I think specifically Europe which has been pretty weak all year. I'm just wondering if that's something that you're seeing or any kind of general comments on craft liner export markets?","Jeff Chalovich","We did see some stabilization in the quarter and then the second half of October coming to November the backlogs are stable and a little bit up actually in the container board space. China is still challenged with demand and their inventories. Europe is much more stable in their inventories coming back into balance and then where most of our shipments go 60% is that Latin America and we've seen that stabilize in the last three weeks or so here also.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe Hajde","I was looking at Slide 11 and the annual cost reduction of $40 million from closing the machine at Charleston. I was curious if this was part of the 200 and synergies you guys have already identified or if it's a separate and above and beyond. And then talk about the kind of how the integration is coming along and what drove the decision to close this machine and then I know that the remaining two machines there have ample flexibility. Can you increase productivity or production of liner board at those machines, if you chose to?","Jeff Chalovich","So that was not a part of the original-200 million of synergies so that was not contemplated when we looked at the synergies originally. Now, the machines do have flexibility. Machine number one had run previously door assort, so we're moving back door assort to machine number one and craft pack to number two, we're reducing the container board we could swing them. It gives us flexibility to swing if we wanted to, but we're looking at the door assortment craft pack moving those and then running 288,000 tons less of our container board at that mill. That was an opportunity at that mill because of the cost structure to really reduce the cost and that's why we really did it. They gave us an opportunity to further match supply and demand, reduce our cost structure at that at that mill and that's why we made the decision.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Just a quick question on the trend in box shipments, I think last quarter. Jeff, you talked about it. July starting off pretty strong at 5.4 looks like, it decelerated a little bit through the quarter to average out 2, just wonder if you could kind of comment on inter-quarter trends there and similarly, as we look at 1Q October starting out at 1.8, would you expect sort of a similar deceleration or maybe destocking at the year end, any signs or expectation of that? And then the last part of it just as you look out the 2020, it looks like the revenue, EBITDA guidance is calling for 1% to 2% box shipment growth any is that a WestRock specific comment or are you expecting the industry to kind of grow at that level? And if so, any reason why you would expect it to kind of accelerate from the flat trajectory it's been on for most of this year?","Jeff Chalovich","So I'll start with the July comment. So we did see some deceleration in that quarter, but that was atypical and if you look at our September for us last year, we were up over 5% per day and so there was a bit of deceleration, but we've come back. It was 2.2 for the quarter, which was a good quarter comparatively to the industry again and if you look at last year at the same quarter, typically we were at 1.7% and then we want to 2.4 and 5.8.","So I expect because of the e-commerce in the build us to look at more of an acceleration through the quarter, then a deceleration and our comments of 1% to 2%, we've grown 2.2% this year and 4% respectively. The two years prior, I expect the business to continue to grow positively and so it's a comment for WestRock not the industry. I think we continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace, we will grow this business and we feel confident in our projections.","Brian Maguire","Just a quick related follow-up just on the corrugated integration rate looks like it a little bit below 80% again. Any reason for that or is it just timing or seasonality and some of the business?","Jeff Chalovich","Seasonality, there is some more of exports, less of our integrated to our partners, Grupo Gondi, which is seasonal that's not uncommon in the quarter over 77% for the year trailing 12 months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Steve and Jeff, in particular, I have to say this Corrugated business has come a long way since 2011 but on this, on the business itself, I just the margins remain at the high end of the industry norms and we're seeing a lot of new capital flow into the business on both the mill and converting side. I wonder if either or both of you can talk about two or three key initiatives to maintain the current high level of margins and returns at WestRock ?","Jeff Chalovich","So we are continuing number one to satisfy customers. We have a outward focus on our customers and I think that solving customer problems and focusing on their critical challenges now will help us grow this business profitably and differentiated. Secondly, we continue to invest in our system both in the mills in the box plants and across our automation platform to reduce our costs.","So cost control, productivity process control, all of those things, doing a good manufacturing process and sites; we're going to continue to do to manage our costs, grow organically and we're going to work on growing the enterprise. We think the combination of the broad portfolio of products, our solutions package is going to give us an opportunity to differentiate and maintain our margin profile.","Ward Dickson","Mark, I'll add on to what Jeff said. i think we've been very transparent about what we're trying to do. I think when you look at a project like we're undertaking at Charleston. There is not a textbook that allows you to just have that come out of the answer. So the people we have, looking at our mill system, looking at our box system and how its operated as efficiently and come up with opportunities to invest capital to get even more out of what we have.","I couldn't be more proud of the people we have in that business, and it shows up in the results and I thank you went back to 2012 and if you look at the way people have talked about the assets that we've acquired we've made, I think tremendous use of the assets on both the converting side and the mill site and compensate that with the strategy to take care of our customers, and I think that's producing the results and I expect we're going to be able to continue to do that going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc.","Mark Connelly","Following on the integration issue and container board you're at 77%. You want to get to 90 usually that means going out and buying independents but we're seeing more and more new box plants getting built shooters getting built and then we're also seeing a lot of debottlenecking going on. So how do you think about getting there when there's fewer independents to buy?","Jeff Chalovich","So the way we think about it is, we believe we can grow that 2% rate over the next 5 years, which puts us with the tonnage we need to get so approximately that 90%. So that's really organic growth . If there is bolt on opportunities in the future that makes sense for us, we'll certainly look at those, but we believe we have the system, the processes and capabilities to grow this business organically over the next 5 years and that would put us toward that 90% range.","Mark Connelly","And within your existing capital spends, are there lot of debottlenecking projects you going have to do to get there?","Jeff Chalovich","We have, as you know, if you look back from 2013 through today, we have built an outstanding system in the container plants and the mill by the investments we've done. We continue to debottleneck our plants and look at that we're bidding the constraints and our typical capital investments have taken care of that. So I believe in our normal capital investments that we have, we can continue to grow at that rate was nothing exceptional in the capital expenditures.","Mark Connelly","Just one clarification. Pat's comments about Consumer Packaging were helpful. But what I'm noticing is that the revenue per ton in that business has actually gone up very nicely even as the volumes have gone down, so was there a significant mix shift?","Pat Lindner","So thank you for the question. This is Pat. So one of the things I'm really proud of our team is how we've managed the available customer demand in this year through our strategic outages. So if you just look at our margins even on lower volume and what we just reported in the fourth quarter in 2019 was 16% at the 100 basis points over the prior year fourth quarter of ' 18 and that really reflects even with our reduced volumes and those volumes being tempered, we still were able to go after the most attractive business in service that consistent with our market segmentation and customer segmentation principles and so we're really proud of the team for doing that. So the answer is yes. To your question, the quality of the business, the mix of the business that we are continuing to serve is improving and increasing and we're really pleased to see that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital","Adam Josephson","Just two questions. Jeff one back to I think Brian's question about your box shipment forecast. So you're forecasting up one to 2 this year, you're up 2.5 last year is the lower rate of growth you're expecting just see economies slowing down, e-commerce slowing down; can you just give me a little sense as to what's, what you're thinking there? And then do you expect to continue to outgrow the industry next year as part of that 1% to 2% growth forecast?","Jeff Chalovich","So I wouldn't say we're looking at accelerating. I think that we're looking at, Yes, we look to outperform the market in general and what we've what we've planned as you've seen is 1% to 2% and we started off the year almost that 2% were 2.5. So when you look at the higher end of that, when we're planning and when we're going to market. So the expectation, again to get to the 90% integration is that we can grow this business reliably at about that rate and that's how we build the system and that's how we think about it and if the market slowdown, we still expect to outperform but I don't have a crystal ball that says what it's going to do exactly in the future.","Adam Josephson","And then just more one on working capital. Could you give us just a rough sense of what your working capital expectation is in terms of the drag on I think you said modest, but can you? Just given that the bridge was getting to $1.3 billion, and you talked about $1 billion plus. Just can you give us any sense of how much of that delta is working cap?","Ward Dickson","It's approximately $250 million.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America.","George Staphos","Just a couple of quick cleanups. One, could you relay what your assumption is for recovered paper pricing recovered fiber pricing relative to what your budget is for next year? And then just a clarification, the insurance receipt in the quarter. I assume that was in the receivable in working capital and the cash flow for the quarter. Thank you, guys. And again, good luck in the quarter.","Ward Dickson","George, this is Ward. So the OCC or recycled fiber assumption for next year is that cost remains fairly constant with the current levels through the first half of the year and a modest increase in the second half. The average for the year is down approximately $15 a ton over the whole year versus fiscal 2019. For the insurance, I will remind everybody in our guidance for the fourth quarter, we assume that we would get $10 million of business interruption, or $15 million of business interruption and we only received $10 million. The total recovery did flow through cash flow in the quarter. It was expected as we were working with our insurance provider. And we've recovered $180 million during the fiscal year. We ultimately believe the claim will be in excess of $200 million.","Thank you very much. Thank you, Jeff. I think that ends our call. Thank you to our audience for joining our call today. As always reach out to us if you have any questions. We're always happy to help. Thanks and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And that now concludes the call.

My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Results Call. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Tractenberg, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Matt Tractenberg","Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued a press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via the link on the right side of the application you're using to view this webcast.","With me today are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of Business Development in Latin America; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for Q&A.","Before we begin, I'd like to point out that during the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, and our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.","Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most closely directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.","So with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. September marks the completion of WestRock's second full fiscal year. It's been a remarkable two years. Our team's made outstanding progress in building WestRock into the leading paper and packaging solutions company that we are today.","WestRock's adjusted earnings per share were $0.87 in the quarter. This includes an adjusted tax rate of 28.4%. Full year adjusted earnings per share were $2.62. Our fiscal 2017 adjusted free cash flow exceeded our $1.2 billion target. We delivered $80 million of productivity in the September quarter, and we're delivering on our $1 billion synergy and performance improvement goal.","In September, we reached a run rate of $840 million, $15 million more than our estimates going into the quarter. Our customers are seeing firsthand what our differentiated strategy means to them. Our comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions uniquely positions WestRock in the marketplace. We're combining the delivery of our products and services to address the business needs of our customers.","As background, we developed an early focus on a group of 40 customers with a total of $4 billion in sales. It's remarkable that three quarters of these customers are buying significant amounts of paper and packaging from multiple business lines across both our consumer and Corrugated Packaging segments.","The fact that so many of our customers by both consumer and corrugated packaging from us makes a lot of sense. Since virtually all of our consumer packaging customers buy boxes and many of our corrugated customers buy paperboard, folding cartons and displays.","In 2017, this focus paid off with our closing an incremental annual run rate of more than $200 million in new business from these 40 accounts. Our success has set the stage for additional growth across our portfolio.","MPS has brought a new set of solutions and is creating even more opportunities to grow our sales across WestRock. I'm confident in our ability to further broaden our relationships with many of our customers. The capabilities of our sales and design teams are key to our success in meeting the needs of our customers.","I'm proud to say that two industry organizations recently recognized the outstanding performance of WestRock's sales and design teams. In September, WestRock's merchandising displays business received 18 Design of the Times Awards from the Path to Purchase Institute.","In October, WestRock's folding carton businesses received 13 awards from the Paperboard Packaging Council. This recognition helps confirm my belief that WestRock is unique in our ability to design and deliver outstanding solutions across so many types of consumer and Corrugated Packaging. This capability differentiates WestRock as we help our customers succeed in their markets.","We've improved our business through acquisitions. During fiscal 2017, we made five acquisitions for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.65 billion. We sold our dispensing business and received net proceeds of over $1 billion.","This net investment of $1.65 billion will increase our future adjusted EBITDA by $300 million on a net basis after the full realization of synergies and after deducting the EBITDA of the sold dispensing business. This results in an effective EBITDA multiple for acquisitions during fiscal 2017 of 5.5 times. This has been a very successful transformation of our portfolio that has increased our focus on paper and packaging.","Given the strength of our cash flows and the long-term outlook for our business, on Friday of last week, the WestRock Board of Directors approved a 7.5% increase in our annual dividend to $1.72 per share. WestRock pays an attractive and competitive dividend, and the board intends to increase our dividend over time as we increase our earnings and cash flow.","I'm pleased with the substantial progress that we've made over the past three years and how our strategy has developed. Fiscal 2017 was an important year for us and sets us up for significant growth in sales, earnings and adjusted operating cash flows in fiscal 2018.","We have attractive opportunities to grow by investing in our business and making acquisitions that improve our business. Our free cash flow and balance sheet provide us ample capacity to take advantage of these opportunities.","Let's turn to the results for the quarter. Sales were over $4 billion, a 12% increase over the prior year quarter. Our sales increase was due to $495 million from acquisitions and $175 million in pricing gains, driven primarily by our containerboard price increases. This growth was partially offset by lower volume and the impact of the sale of the dispensing business.","Total company adjusted EBITDA margins of 16.1% were stable year-over-year. This is impressive given the $162 million in inflation that we experienced in the quarter and the $27 million negative impact of the hurricanes.","For the full year, total input cost and labor inflation was $548 million. Productivity was an important contributor to earnings, with $80 million realized in the quarter and $361 million for the full year.","Our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was well below our guidance, mainly due to the very favorable resolution of several items earlier than we thought heading into the quarter. Our balance sheet remains in great shape with ending leverage of 2.54 times. Our pension plans are fully funded.","Turning to the Corrugated Packaging segment. WestRock team delivered strong results in the quarter even after considering the impacts of the hurricanes and high recovered fiber cost. The fundamentals of supply and demand within our North American Corrugated business are very strong.","Global demand for virgin containerboard is growing, and export market pricing has been increasing. During the quarter, WestRock's North American Corrugated Packaging segment sales were $1.95 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $359 million.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.2%. This is an increase of 100 basis points over the prior year quarter. Our fourth quarter North American daily box shipments increased 7.5% year-over-year due to gains in e-commerce, pizza, dairy, bakery and industrial markets, as well as the three acquisitions we made during the year. October daily box shipments have increased by 4.3% from the prior year period.","We are improving our channel mix. Our integration rate for North American Corrugated Packaging business for the quarter was 75%. This represents an increase of 700 basis points from last year and represents substantial progress toward our target of being 80% integrated.","With our strong domestic box demand, we sold 213,000 tons to export markets. This was 34% less than the prior year quarter. This was the lowest quarterly amount we've sold to export markets in over four years.","While our export volume declined, our export pricing increased. Average pricing across all export containerboard markets increased by more than $100 per ton year-over-year and more than $30 per ton sequentially.","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria resulted in a loss of 30,000 tons of mill production and a pretax reduction in income of $15 million. We incurred $7 million in incremental cost from the consolidation of two older box plants into a single state-of-the-art plant in Sioux City, Iowa, and the consolidation of our acquired Island Container plant into our Deer Park, New York plant.","On a year-over-year basis, recycled fiber cost increased $60 per head per ton with a $66 million unfavorable impact to segment results. Total inflation across the corrugated segment was $116 million. As we prepare for our winter maintenance outages, we're building our inventory and expect containerboard inventory to increase by 106,000 tons sequentially and reach a peak in our first quarter.","We expect our inventory to decline over the balance of the year, ending fiscal 2018 at approximately 60,000 tons higher than the end of fiscal 2017. We shipped 54,000 tons of virgin containerboard to the Grupo Gondi joint venture during the quarter, and we expect shipments to increase as Gondi grows its business.","Gondi's new lightweight recycled linerboard mill, with a projected investment of $300 million, will be built in Monterrey, Mexico, and will bring its annual production to more than 1 million tons. In October, WestRock increased our investment in the attractive Mexican market with an additional $108 million equity investment. This brings our ownership in the joint venture to 32.3%.","We performed well in Brazil with box line growth of almost 8%, ahead of market growth of 6%. We incurred $6 million of one-time pretax items in the quarter, adversely affecting adjusted EBITDA margins by 500 basis points.","We currently operate an older box plant in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This plant produces nearly 2 billion square feet of Corrugated Packaging. We've considered many alternatives and concluded that our best alternative is to replace our old box plant with a new, exceptionally well-equipped box plant at a new site also in the state of Sao Paulo.","When fully operational, this new plant will produce over 4 billion square feet of Corrugated Packaging. This investment will provide multiple benefits to us. First, we'll improve our cost structure and improve our already attractive margins from operating a much more efficiency box line.","Second, we build the capacity to serve the growing Brazilian market. Third, we'll integrate over 100,000 tons of our own high-quality virgin containerboard production from our trades Varkaus Mill. Lastly, we'll fund the project entirely from the cash flow we generate from our existing operations in Brazil. The net cost of the project will be approximately $125 million, and we expect that the plant will be operational by the end of fiscal year 2019.","The WestRock Consumer Packaging team delivered improved sales and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Markets remain mixed would strength in liquid packaging, food service, health and beauty and the strength balance by weaker demand in tobacco and commercial print applications.","Overall demand within food packaging and beverage end markets has been relatively stable, with some pockets of strong growth in the U.S. craft brew, Latin American and Asian Pacific beer and emerging brands in food. Backlogs across our systems are normal for this time of year. Our SBS and CNK system backlogs are about five weeks and CRV backlogs are over two weeks.","Net sales were $1.87 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $280 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 15%. Segment shipments, excluding pulp, increased 6% and were helped by the NPF and Hannapak acquisitions. Pricing and mix were favorable as we realized PPW published price increases, and we shifted pulp production to higher-value paperboard production.","The impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma reduced our production by 22,000 tons and reduced our pretax income by $12 million. The consumer packaging team delivered $33 million in productivity for the quarter and $205 million for the year.","This outstanding result has been due to the effort by the entire team and includes the impact of integrating our businesses, closing redundant facilities and operating more efficiently at our mills, our converting plants and across our SG&A categories.","The Multi Packaging Solutions business performed very well in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $65 million was more than MPS reported as a stand-alone company last year. The integration is well underway. We've announced the closure and restructuring of three plants that were made redundant as a result of the acquisition.","As of the end of the quarter, we've achieved more than $20 million of run rate synergies and performance improvements, and we remain on track to achieve $85 million by the end of fiscal 2019.","The Hannapak acquisition performed well in the quarter, and we're introducing our global customers to our new capabilities in the region. Overall, WestRock had a solid quarter. We're well positioned in executing our strategic plan.","I'll turn the call over now to Ward. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thanks, Steve. Our land and development monetization activity is on track to deliver $150 million to $175 million in cash flow next year as well as realize the full cumulative $275 million to $300 million in cash flow from these efforts.","As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the September quarter in an annual run rate of $840 million. We realized $340 million of run rate growth in fiscal 2017 and had $361 million of synergies and productivity flow through our income statement in the year.","Our drive to generate productivity is shared by all of our businesses and functions. Beyond capturing the merger and acquisition-related synergies from internalization, footprint actions and procurement savings, we continue to invest into capital projects that reduce our costs, drive earnings growth and improve our competitiveness across our mill and converting network.","For example, we've installed 29 of the planned 30 EVOL Flexo Folder Gluer\u2019s in our container plants. In our Consumer Packaging converting network, we've updated 13 facilities with printing press and die cutter investments over the last two years.","Our culture of continuous improvement is demonstrated by the breadth of our deployment of Lean Six Sigma across our facilities. We now have more than 850 trained black, green and yellow belts across our company.","During fiscal 2017, we completed approximately 1,000 projects that were, in aggregate, a significant contributor to our overall performance improvement. As previously indicated, we expect to reach our $1 billion target during the upcoming June quarter.","Our business is stable, and we generated significant adjusted free cash flow, more than $800 million after dividends in fiscal 2017. How we allocate this capital is important to our overall strategy and to increase shareholder value. Our first priority is to invest in our business, and we have numerous opportunities in fiscal 2018 and beyond.","Our base capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 will be $850 million, with approximately 50% of that for maintenance and replacement projects, and the remaining investments generating an attractive return that improve our mill and converting assets. We have consistently generated after-tax unlevered returns on average in the 20% range.","In addition to the $850 million of base capital in fiscal 2018, we expect to invest $100 million in two strategic projects: the Brazilian box plant and the installation of the state-of-the-art plant and coder at the Mahrt mill. The net investment in these two projects will be approximately $175 million to $200 million over a two-year period, and are expected that they will provide unlevered after-tax returns in the high teens.","As evidenced by last week's dividend announcement, we are improving our business and growing our earnings and cash flow, which enables us to increase the dividend and return more capital to our stockholders. Share repurchases also remain an effective way for us to return value to stockholders and maintain proper leverage on our business.","Fiscal first quarter earnings are usually lower than the fourth fiscal quarter due to three factors: First, seasonal demand is lower in the December fourth quarter as compared to the September quarter, along with one less shipping day sequentially.","Second, increased mill maintenance activity with 113,000 tons of maintenance downtime across our containerboard and consumer mill systems as compared to 19,000 tons in the September quarter, and third, higher medical insurance cost as employees spend more on health care in the December quarter.","In the first quarter, we expect the combination of price and mix to be positive and volumes to be negative. The net impact of these items is a negative pretax impact of $30 million to $35 million. The assumption regarding WestRock's recycled fiber index is $120 per ton in the first quarter or a decrease of $55 per ton sequentially.","Given this recent decline, we expect an overall sequential commodity deflation benefit between $28 million and $38 million pretax. While OCC should be favorable, we do expect some negative impact from freight and chemicals and increases to virgin fiber pricing due to the recent weather.","The hurricane impact from both Q4 and the carryover into Q1 will have an approximate $20 million positive impact on first quarter results. The combination of maintenance downtime and the previously mentioned group insurance will have a $35 million negative pretax impact. The increase in the adjusted tax rate to 32.5% to 33% will have a negative impact of $0.05.","Increases to net interest expense, D&A and outstanding shares will have a negative impact of approximately $0.03. These items would lead you to a first quarter adjusted EPS range that is more than 50% higher than last year's first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.47, a testament to our stronger business and solid industry fundamentals.","Moving to the full year. We're very excited about the state of our business and overall industry conditions and are expecting a very strong fiscal 2018. With our current portfolio composition and positive volume and pricing dynamics, we expect strong growth in the upcoming year.","First, we anticipate net sales growth to be up approximately 10% from the prior year period, resulting in more than $16.3 billion. These sales will be approximately 55% in Corrugated Packaging and 45% in Consumer Packaging.","Second, we anticipate adjusted operating cash flow of more than $2.3 billion, a growth of more than 15%. And finally, we expect to achieve adjusted segment EBITDA growth of more than $2.8 billion, approximately 20% over fiscal 2017.","Included in our guidance is approximately $275 million to $300 million in productivity and acquisition-related synergies, including internalization of additional tons. With the potential volatility in recycled fiber prices, transparency regarding our inflation assumptions is important.","We anticipate overall commodity inflation of $90 million and increased labor, health care and benefit costs of $130 million. Included in the commodity inflation figure is an average recycled fiber index price for WestRock of approximately $140 per ton for the year, as compared to $147 per ton this year.","Due to the investment that I discussed earlier, we are forecasting total CapEx of $950 million for the year with $850 million in base CapEx and additional $100 million for the Brazilian box plant and the Mahrt coder.","And finally, we recommend using a full year book tax rate between 32% and 33%, and you can find other key assumptions for fiscal 2018 in the appendix. We're excited about the progress we are making in our business, and it is translating into strong financial performance. Fiscal 2018 is setting up to be a very good year.","Steve, I'll hand it back over to you for closing comments.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. I'm proud of the progress we made in our first two years as WestRock. We're partnering with our customers about differentiated solutions that help them win in their markets, and we're building our business in an industry with very attractive long-term fundamentals.","Our strategy is working. We have a large pipeline of internal and external opportunities that will improve our business for the long-term. In fiscal 2018, we expect to significantly grow sales, EBITDA and cash flow.","Using our capital allocation framework, we are reinvesting our cash flow to generate strong returns, improve our business, create long-term value for our customers, employees and investors.","On December 8, we'll be holding our first Financial Analyst and Investor Day in New York City. For those of you who won't be able to attend in person, we'll be webcasting the event live. You can contact Matt for more information. Matt, I'll turn it over to you.","Matt Tractenberg","Thank you, Steve. I\u2019d like to remind the audience, that in the interest of time, please limit your questions to one with a single follow-up, if needed. We\u2019ll get to as many as time allows. Sarah, can you please open the call for our questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the all details and congratulations on the progress in fiscal 2017. My two questions are going to be really more on strategy and bigger picture. Steve, if you would \u2013 and gentlemen, if you could talk about how defensible you think the strategy is and your positioning is relative to your \u2013 obviously, very competent peers that's been able to generate \u2013 if I heard you correctly, that $200 million run rate pickup in EBITDA from customers right \u2013 to paraphrase your cross-selling? What are you doing differently, to the extent you can comment on that on this call, that you think is defensible that machinery or something else?","And then the second question is, we again appreciate all the color you gave us on your guidance and assumptions. On OCC, given the volatility that we've seen over the last several years, which is probably a little bit more than normal, how is that being built into your strategy, if at all, in terms of how you run your business going forward? Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, George. First, the $200 million increase in sales.","George Staphos","Thank you. Sorry about that. Have to change the model again. Okay.","Steve Voorhees","Yes. I think with respect to defensibility, our business is one of blocking and tackling. I think our \u2013 we just need to block and tackle better than our competition. And we're doing a lot to integrate our product and solution offerings. I think \u2013 I mentioned the 40 accounts. I think we organized those teams over a year ago, and we include on those teams experts in each of the products and solutions that are relevant to the key account. I think we're doing very well with that. We've also organize dedicated teams to meet the needs of specific end markets.","And I'm not going to go through all of the specific end markets, but a really good example of this is craft beer, where we have developed \u2013 George, you mentioned machinery, we have developed the custom machinery solution offering both corrugated and folding cartons. And we're spending a significant amount of resources to provide commercial and technical training across our sales force and support our ability to provide solutions to the customers. And I think we made acquisitions, MPS in particular, provides us great experience in integrating the sale of cartons, labels and inserts, providing great example to us as we build those capability across WestRock. Again, I'm very confident in our ability to do that and just very happy with the strategy.","George Staphos","Steve, you think your machinery capability is a little bit better or differentiated versus peers? You don't have to spend a lot of time. It\u2019s just a quick tag on.","Steve Voorhees","I think it is. I think in \u2013 both the corrugated and consumer great capability.","George Staphos","Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","And I think, George, you saw it at Path Expo. So in fact, I'd like you have some direct experience with that. With respect to OCC. OCC is volatile. I think it's difficult to assess the direction it will take long term. I think we're balanced. Our fiber mix is about 60% virgin and 40% recycled. And I think we build into the way we operate our business being flexible to try to adapt to whatever market conditions and OCC prices affect us. So I think our strategy is rich in that regard.","George Staphos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Debbie Jones","Hi, good morning. I wanted to focus a bit on Brazil. Can you talk about your decision to invest any amount of capital? What are you seeing if it\u2019s going to changes your mind on your purpose in the region? And should we expect any kind of near-term headwinds as you're focusing on these projects in the region?","Steve Voorhees","Debbie, I'm going to let Jim Porter respond to that.","Jim Porter","Good morning, Debbie. First of all, we've got just a great business in Brazil. It's a outstanding management team. We've got a great portfolio of assets. The best virgin containerboard in the market and a growing marketplace. So it's \u2013 we love that business. And currently, we're near capacity in our packaging system. And as Steve mentioned in his remarks, we've got a business in Valinhos. That's about a 2 billion square foot plant. That's produced excellent results over time, but it's really at capacity, and we have the opportunity to upgrade it.","So this new plant will be one in which we replace that volume with state-of-the-art capabilities and in fact double that capacity, giving us the capability to capture the growing market in Brazil, reduce our cost and further integrate over 100,000 tons of our high-quality virgin board to capture the needs of the Brazilian market. So we think it's an outstanding project returns in the high-teens. And it just further complements the already excellent business we have in that region.","Debbie Jones","Okay. And then just quick question on the Q4 guidance. Are you assuming \u2013 or can you quantify at all how much you think is [Audio Dip] hurricane-related headwinds? And then on the maintenance and insurance benefits, are you \u2013 headwind \u2013 are you going to kind of parse that out? And how is that aligns to your expectations? Is there anything on the hurricane moving into Q4 as it related to maintenance? Sorry, that I believe about that?","Ward Dickson","Debbie, this is Ward. So the hurricane, the bleed over into Q1 is primarily in the logistics and supply chain with some M&R as well. And it's \u2013 we have about $8 million, $7 million to $8 million embedded into our outlook for Q1 related to additional costs that we'll have really \u2013 as a result of the hurricane. When I look at the group insurance and the M&R, that total is \u2013 or the group insurance and the maintenance and outage expense, that amount, it's roughly split half and half between those two categories. And the group insurance, sequential increase that we projected is consistent with the level that we saw from Q4 to Q1 of last year.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks, I will turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire","Good morning, everyone. So I want to start with a question on the export prices in containerboard. You noted they're up quite a bit sequentially and year-over-year. And I know, over the last year or two, priority has been to improve the domestic integration and ship some of your export tons towards the domestic market. Just wondering if the pickup in export pricing and the sort of narrowing of the spread between domestic and export price over the last couple of quarters has changed your thinking there at all and just your prioritization of capital going forward. Do you \u2013 do these downstream integration still makes sense? Or does the pretty strong export market make that an attractive outlook now?","Steve Voorhees","Jeff.","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, Brian. Good morning. So there has been a narrowing of the gap in export market, and as Steve reported, we\u2019re up little over $100 a ton. We'll maintain a significant presence in the export markets. We have long-standing and valuable relationships in those markets, and we intend to stay there. As we stated in previous calls, we continue to manage details of our three channels, including box, domestic and export. And over time, though, integration of our box plant system has been and is today the most profitable channel, with the least amount of market fluctuations over time. That's why we're trying to increase our integration rate. Even as we do that, we have over 700,000 tons plus, even if we made it to 80% of containerboard that we can export. So we're going to maintain a significant presence in those markets.","Downstream acquisitions are still attractive, and each acquisition we judge on its own merits. So what other returns we can generate? Does it fit our strategy? Would it put us into new and expanding markets? What synergies can we garnish? And over time, integration has been the least volatile and offers the most attractive margins in all of our channels. So as far us looking at those, we have a disciplined approach to investing capital. We have shown the ability to integrate acquisitions over time, and so we'll continue to look at it in that regard.","Brian Maguire","Okay. And just another quick question on the consumer side of the business. Last week, we had a pretty big news from two of the players in the industry kind of combining some of their SBS assets. Just wondering, as you look ahead on the box board markets in general, do you think that, that level of consolidation is a positive for the industry? Or do you think that there could be any challenges to WestRock from it? But just kind of an overall flavor of any impact you see from that potential transaction.","Steve Voorhees","Bob.","Bob Feeser","Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Bob. Overall, we weren't surprised by the announcement. And we do think it's generally positive. It doesn't change our strategy in any way. We have a very strong business model and a strong strategy in the markets. We like the penetration that we have in the targeted end markets with our differentiated packaging solutions. We've got about 50% of our mix today that's in health and beauty, food service and liquid packaging. And we see those markets as growing better than GDP. And we've got 40% of the mix that's really what we feel is a stable retail food and beverage business. And we've got great solutions, where we're winning business in those end markets. So overall, we feel like we're going to be very good and win within those markets.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. First, congrats on the stronger volume in the box business. I was hoping to get any senses to what's been your experience in October. Did that continue? And then also, thank you for the transparency on the OCC. And you \u2013 clearly, you're building an escalation in OCC pricing as the year goes along. And I imagine that, on the containerboard pricing side, you just put as a placeholder where prices are. But I just clarify \u2013 would want to clarify, I assume that's not necessarily a forecast. That's just a placeholder. And in that context, well, what would be the critical variables, if we are in a rising OCC environment again, what would be the critical variables that might influence on how you think pricing on the containerboard side might play out, what the variables are? Obviously, I don't expect you\u2019re going to tell me what your plans would be, but the variables you need to focus on.","Ward Dickson","Yes. I'll start with the assumptions that are embedded in the model. I'll start with OCC for FY 2018. As we said, the average, in the first quarter, for our index is $20 per ton. And then we have an increase of approximately $20 per ton in the second quarter and then just slight moderation upwards from that through the remainder of the fiscal year to get to an average of $140 per ton compared to this year's average of $147 per ton. Embedded in our revenue model is the full year impact of the implementation of the previously announced price increases both in Corrugated and on the consumer side of the business. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Bob.","Bob Feeser","Hey, Mark. Good morning. These multiple variables when we look at when we consider how we go-to-market. Certainly, inflationary cost, input cost we look at. We look at our channels. We look at our inventory supplies. We look at our demand, and how that's shaping up. We look at \u2013 do we have specialty projects, how we can differentiate it in markets. So there's a host of variables that we consider in our strategy when we look at pricing going forward. October, I'll talk a little bit about the volumes. Our volumes remain healthy. So we're at 7.5% in the quarter. We're up over 4% in October. Even with some of the headwinds in the hurricanes, our Puerto Rico plant is still only at 30% production on the Island. So the markets remain strong. Our inventories remain tight. Our backlogs remain strong. So we started off the month as we ended the quarter, and we don't see that changing right now.","Mark Weintraub","And just to clarify, was that 4% average a week or average a day?","Bob Feeser","Yes. Per day.","Mark Weintraub","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Ventura [ph] from Nemo Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Just to come back on those box volumes numbers one more time. Sorry if I missed it. But did you mention how much of that was M&A versus organic?","Bob Feeser","No I did. So when we look at \u2013 we've integrated acquisitions across our business. One plant we've totally closed and moved into our Northeast businesses. We're investing capital to grow the business. The 7.5%, just to give you a range, I'll \u2013 we're not going to continue to track it, but the 7.5% in the quarter, we are right on top of the FBA, over 4% was organic. But as we move business around the new plant and customer pairings, we're not going to continue to break out what was organic and what was acquisition because the business gets mixed into other plants, and we're investing the capital to grow the business both organically and through acquisition.","Unidentified Analyst","No, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just one follow-up. Can you talk about what your integration level will be in consumer packaging after MPSX and Hannapak? And what your target is in consumers packaging for integration, and where does that sits high up of your priorities or getting more integration?","Steve Voorhees","Yes, our overall integrations in consumer packaging are roughly 35%, and that varies significantly by substrate. So in SBS, roughly 20%, in CUK, roughly 70%, and in CRB, a little over 55%, and we haven't set a specific target for overall integrations within consumer. We continue to look at a number of opportunities that are attractive to grow the business in attractive end markets. And to the extent that, that also has integration benefits for us, that's a positive and certainly something that we would look at.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I will turn it over. Good luck in 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Good morning, Steve and Ward. First question, it has to do with what your thoughts are about \u2013 or just an update. You mentioned Gondi's new machine, which, I assume, will \u2013 is underway \u2013 or in terms of construction. And your tons to them continue to grow. But when they start the new machine up, will that free up some of the tons you're sending to them from the North American mills you have? And roughly, will that be proportionate to what they start up? Or would it be something that's less than that, just given the rate of growth?","Steve Voorhees","Jim.","Jim Porter","Good morning, Chip. No, this new mill will not impact in any way our virgin containerboard supply to Gondi and Mexico. In fact, we anticipate that as they continue to grow as the agricultural demand raises in the region. The premise is this investment is that the markets in Mexico are just extremely tight, and Gondi has a mill system of about 650,000 metric tons and packaging demand is over 1.2 million tons. So they're in the market buying recycle board in Mexico that is very tight. And so this capacity will allow us to integrate the growing packaging to meet demand that we have. And we think it's an excellent investment for an excellent business that Gondi operates in Mexico.","Chip Dillon","And on that, you mentioned the tightness down there. Does that extend also to the raw materials situation? I noticed one of their major competitors is doing something that seems a little bit out of convention by basically taking over a recycled newsprint mill way up in the Seattle area. I guess, presumably, to convert that to recycle board and send that back to Mexico would be my guess. I didn't know if you had any thoughts on that. Just so everyone knows, this was announced many months ago.","Steve Voorhees","I really have no insight in particular on that. We're aware of that investment, and it's an interesting transaction with what the strategy is. I really can't speak to, Chip.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And then lastly, Steve, you've mentioned \u2013 you all have just a fantastic track record going back certainly to 2010 and really putting with the Smurfit-Stone deal, putting together assets others have built. As you think about the future and the tight supplies in North America, how do you think about getting your hands on new boards supply? And would that include maybe partnering with others that might spend their capital to convert their capacity and in return you offer some kind of an off-take agreement? Is that something that you even consider as you look out and you think about the supplies continuing to get tighter?","Steve Voorhees","We look at a bunch of different alternatives as we look at how we can improve our business. I think we're \u2013 WestRock is a, I think, in a good position to be able to look at a number of different alternatives. I think those \u2013 pretty consistently our capital allocation strategy. So we're just trying to improve our business. I think we have the platform to be able to continue to do that.","Chip Dillon","And in that vein, do you feel you\u2019re well supplied in your own system, say it through fiscal 2019?","Steve Voorhees","I'm comfortable with where we are with our supply through fiscal 2019.","Chip Dillon","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, guys. Congratulations as far as strong finish of the year. Just a couple \u2013 one quick question and then another question. Consumer. First quick question, the $1.35 billion plus of free cash flow you talked about, is that inclusive of how much of land sale? Is that roughly $100 million, or?","Ward Dickson","The net after-tax cash flow related to the land sales next year will be approximately $150 million \u2013 $155 million to $160 million in that range. And that compares to \u2013 its approximately a $30 million increase versus what we did in fiscal 2017.","Chris Manuel","Does that leave any left for 2019? Or is that pretty much in the program?","Ward Dickson","Pretty much end of the program.","Chris Manuel","Okay. Perfect. And then the second question I had was, when we look at the consumer business, it looks like price kicked positive this quarter to first quarter in a while it's done so, about, I think, $7 million if I\u2019m looking at the slide. What's the cadence? I think you've got a chunk more there to come with the April increases across some of the grade. How does that layer through? Is that mostly a calendar 2018 event? Or could we see some of that here in your first quarter?","Bob Feeser","Yes, Chris, this is Bob Feeser. We're realizing the $20 in SBS, that was also reflected in PPW. So that\u2019s kind of continued to flow through in the \u2013 our fiscal first quarter and through 2018. Then also, the CRB increase, we're realizing the $50 that was also reflected in PPW. Most of that will flow over the next two quarters, and we will see the full annual benefit of that in our fiscal 2018.","Ward Dickson","I would also add, in the quarter, a part of that benefit is the mix benefit related to the 32,000 tons of less pulp shipment and sales in the quarter.","Bob Feeser","Yes, that's been a \u2013 just a follow-on that. That's been an important driver of price\/mix for us as well, that conversion of pulp to paperboard within our system.","Chris Manuel","Okay, guys. Thank you, good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. A question on consumer. You indicated you were pleased with the MPS business and earnings were up year-over-year. I was wondering if you could talk about what categories or products have been strong for MPS. I think, as a public company, they had seen some uneven demand trends. And if you could just talk about the overall integration of the business. And specifically, in terms of leveraging, their labeling insert capabilities, is that something that you've been able to bring to other WestRock-converting facilities?","Jim Porter","Yes. Anthony, just in terms of some of the areas in MPS that had been strong, the whole health and beauty segment in general has been strong. The fundamentals are good in that market. And we see that growing in the 3% to 5% range. And certainly, MPS is taking advantage of that as well. Another area has been high-end confection. Our business in Europe has been quite strong. And then also the spirits business in the UK has also been strong as well. So those are just some of the segments that within MPS where we've seen good strength in terms of overall demand.","In terms of taking advantage of some of the capabilities with labels, inserts and other products, we're really beginning to integrate that into our overall offering. It's still early on, I would say, in terms of the opportunity for us to leverage that, but we're having great conversations with a number of customers, where we believe that those are capabilities that we will be able to leverage in the food markets, to some extent, the beverage markets as well.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just following up on Chip's question on Gondi. Looks like you increased your stake to 32%. I think when you originally entered the JV, it was 25%. Given the strength of the Mexican market, I mean, is there potential to raise your ownership stake further or even possibly consolidate the business at some point?","Steve Voorhees","There's that potential. I think, right now, we're very happy with where we are at the 32%. They've got a great management team, great partners. And we are very happy for with where we are.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Lars Kjellberg","Thank you. Just had two questions. In terms of the cost inflation that you're calling, about $220 million, can you give us any color on how you internally can mitigate that? Or what sort of actions you're taking? We obviously know about the continuation of the benefits from the [indiscernible] deal et cetera. But any internal metrics that can kind of call out with the net cost inflation? How you see that? And also in consumer board, there's a lot of moving parts at this moment. Of course, if you start with FX and the potential import penetration, if you've seen any change in that? And equally so, there's quite a lot of overseas capacity, in particular, that is not integrated. Are you seeing any dynamic changes in the business that would potentially improve domestic supply-demand conditions and pricing generally?","Steve Voorhees","I'll start with the productivity and inflation assumptions. We \u2013 many of our inflation assumptions are tied to broad market trends. And I believe that it really reinforces the need for us to generate productivity in our business. If you look at \u2013 that's the single most important thing that we can control. If you look at the relationship in FY 2018 of our productivity and the internalization \u2013 successful internalization of the MPS tons, it's greater than the inflation that we're forecasting for the business. So broadly speaking, we're subject to fluctuations in commodities that all of our peers face, and the thing that we have the most control over is the execution of our productivity programs and the guidance that we provided for FY 2018, we're actually gaining ground and improving earnings by generating more productivity than the input cost inflation is for the fiscal year. And now I'll turn it over to Bob.","Bob Feeser","Yes. On the \u2013 just \u2013 you mentioned about the moving pieces around paperboard in the consumer markets. It's certainly \u2013 I think that's certainly true. But Overall, we don't see any significant changes from where we were at, say, six months ago. Just maybe a comment on penetration around imports. Again, we continue to see very limited penetration in the U.S. markets. To the extent that we have seen, some that's been more in the low-end plate markets within food service and perhaps more penetration in Mexico and Latin America. But overall, very little impact on our business, at least in the end markets that we participate in.","Lars Kjellberg","Do you have any thoughts on any upcoming commercials and buy something that will add meaningful \u2013 to this market? Are you seeing anything on that? Anyone of that is \u2013 your customers, sort of trying to change suppliers?","Bob Feeser","Yes, I think it's still very early on. We're certainly aware of that pending conversion. And we are extremely well positioned in the market, commercial print markets, with major distributors, so I feel quite good about our position, and we'll see how this plays out in the market.","Lars Kjellberg","Thank you, very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner, Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks, good morning.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Gaffner","Hi, Steve, just wanted to ask about the box plant consolidation, $7 million headwind in the quarter. Is that more of a onetime event? Or what caused that? And should we expect that going forward?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, Scott good morning. It\u2019s Jeff. So the Sioux City project is an exciting project. It's really the consolidation of two plants within seven miles of one another into one plant. It's also very complex. So we're operating the Sioux City Southland while we're consolidating and rebuilding it. So we've expanded the building. The unemployment rate in that market is 3%. So we paid some stay-on bonuses for folks in North, but they were able to find jobs. So we had if we run it like a straight contingency. We've moved people in. We have significant cost from overtime, labor, some of the freight that happened from the hurricane has caused spot market increases in freight. We had to buy incremental tooling. So it has been an exciting project but added some extra cost that we couldn't anticipate. I think we've accounted for, going forward into the quarters, what we need to. So I don't see any incremental upset conditions, but the plant is going to be a world-class plant. It's exciting for customers and for our folks in that marketplace. Greenfield is probably easier to build in, but it's harder to start up and satisfy customers. So it's a good project overall.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And when would that facility be completed, do you think?","Jeff Chalovich","So certificate of occupancy should be by the beginning of December, then we do shakedowns and get the equipment up and going. So we had originally anticipated in January. And so we'll be a little early. Construction is on time. So we're going to \u2013 we're already starting the corrugator up. We got a new flex going there, another one moving in, we still have some things to moving and get running. But overall, we should have our CEO by December 1.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And then just one follow-up, Jeff, on the box business. I think you said October was up a little over 4% after the 7.5% in the quarter. Is there anything within that, whether it's just a comp year-over-year that \u2013 I mean, slight deceleration, but anything of note in that number that you call out?","Jeff Chalovich","No, I think \u2013 to your first point, we were up 4.5% FBA at the last year in October. So it is a harder comp, and we outperformed the market by over three points last year. But it's one month in the quarter. It's not final yet, either. So the 4%, 3% could move up a little or down a little. It's going to be over 4%. But no, there's nothing in our business or backlog that makes me think there's anything different than what we've experienced in the last quarter.","Scott Gaffner","Okay, thanks Jeff, thanks Steve. See you guys in a few weeks.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, I will turn the call back to you.","Matt Tractenberg","Thank you, Sarah, and thank you for our audience, for your time this morning. We appreciate your interest in WestRock, if you have question following the call Investor Relations team happy to help you. You can find our contact on today\u2019s earnings release.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company Third Quarter FY '17 Results Call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Tractenberg, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Matt Tractenberg","Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We issued a press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our Web site. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via the link on the right side of the application you\u2019re using to view this webcast.","With me on today\u2019s call are WestRock\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of Business Development and Latin America; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to point out that during the course of today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, and our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.","Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during today\u2019s call. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our Web site.","So with that said, I\u2019ll turn it over to you, Steve.","Steven Voorhees","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. The WestRock team delivered outstanding results during the June quarter. We generated $0.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $94 million in year-over-year productivity improvements. These productivity improvements, along with improved pricing and channel mix, more than offset the extraordinarily high input cost that we\u2019ve had to absorb over the past year.","Our comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions enables WestRock to deliver value to our customers. We deliver value to our customers by using our capabilities to develop solutions that help our customers grow their sales, lower their total costs, reduce their operating risk and achieve their sustainability goals. Our acquisitions enhance our product portfolio, improve our integration levels and expand our footprint. This enables us to better serve and deliver value to our customers.","We\u2019ve made substantial progress toward our $1 billion productivity goal. We achieved an annual run rate of $760 million at the end of June, and we expect to reach the $1 billion goal by June of 2018. These achievements have been a direct result of our teammates executing our strategy throughout WestRock and implementing opportunities to do things better each and every day.","We\u2019ve generated $950 million in adjusted free cash flow through June of this fiscal year, and we\u2019re on track to meet or exceed the $1.2 billion that we said we\u2019d generate this fiscal year. The reliability of our cash flow reflects the strength of our company and the strength of our business model.","We\u2019ve taken steps to further transform our portfolio to a business fully focused on paper and packaging. These steps included the sale of our dispensing business, the sale of our interest in ArborGen and the accelerated sales of our land and development properties.","We\u2019re strengthening and building our paper and packaging portfolio and have made a number of recent acquisitions. The largest of the acquisitions is Multi Packaging Solutions. MPS has substantially increased our participation in the higher growth healthcare and specialty packaging markets, has expanded our operating footprint in Europe and Asia.","Since closing the transaction, we\u2019ve made significant progress integrating the organization and identifying footprint opportunities. And we\u2019re beginning to capture the benefits of paperboard integration. We\u2019ve transitioned eight folding carton plants serving primarily health and beauty markets to the MPS operations. This has enhanced our capabilities to serve specialty packaging customers with an expanded geographic footprint.","We\u2019re optimizing the footprint of our combined system by evaluating opportunities to eliminate excess manufacturing capacity and increase utilization across the most efficient plants in our system. Last month, we announced the closure of a folding carton facility in Texas, and we\u2019re repurposing one of our Canadian facilities from a combined folding carton and label facility to one producing only labels.","We\u2019ve initiated the supply of our paperboard to our MPS facilities and expect to achieve our target run rate of 100,000 tons per year of paperboard integration by the end of fiscal 2018. We\u2019ve moved quickly to achieve the synergies from the transaction and believe we\u2019ll capture more than half of our expected $85 million of synergies during fiscal 2018 and hit a full run rate by the end of fiscal 2019.","MPS has been successful in standardizing their manufacturing processes across geographies. For example, MPS has been able to successfully provide cartons manufactured in North America, Europe and Asia to global customers interested in consistent, high-quality packaging around the world. This capability will be enhanced by the integrated supply of high-quality paperboard from WestRock\u2019s mills.","Earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Hannapak, an Australian converter with whom we\u2019ve had a long-term relationship as the converting partner for our beverage paperboard for our customers in Australia. The $60 million acquisition will integrate our converting and paperboard sales, and it\u2019s a natural extension for our consumer business in Australia. Hannapak will help improve our beverage business and will give us a platform for further growth in the food, food service, health and beauty markets with existing and new customers. The acquisition is immediately accretive on a cash flow and earnings basis.","We completed two important corrugated acquisitions in June and July with U.S. Corrugated and Island Container. The addition of U.S. Corrugated has expanded our presence in geographies where we need the converting capacity. The acquisitions integrate \u2013 the U.S. Corrugated acquisition integrates more than a 100,000 tons of containerboard with another 50,000 tons committed in a long-term agreement.","Island Container serves an outstanding host of customers in the New York and New Jersey area and will integrate another 80,000 tons of containerboard. The integration of these facilities and the commercial teams is well underway and will improve our Corrugated Packaging business in a number of ways, including increasing our integration level by 300 basis points from 70% to 73%.","Let\u2019s turn to the details of our third quarter performance. Sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $598 million for a consolidated margin of 16.2%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.74. Pre-tax income was favorably impacted by $13 million from the sale of our equity interest in ArborGen.","We\u2019re benefiting from favorable demand and price trends across our portfolio. We expect to achieve the full $50 per ton corrugated price increase that was published in April by the end of September. We\u2019re implementing several published price increases within our consumer grades that are beginning to offset last year\u2019s index price reductions.","Total commodity inflation was $123 million headwind year-over-year. OCC accounted for $81 million or the vast majority of the increase. The sequential increase of $13 per ton, the average price of OCC, was consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.","Our leverage ratio of 2.58 times was consistent with our expectations, was slightly above the high end of our targeted leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.5 times. We expect our strong cash flow to quickly bring us to within our targeted leverage ratio without compromising our ability to make investments to strengthen our business.","The WestRock Corrugated Packaging team executed extremely well in the quarter. We implemented price increases across each one of our channels. We integrated the Star Pizza and U.S. Corrugated containerboard supply into our system. We grew back volumes by providing unique and differentiated solutions to our customers.","Our operating rates remained high at 96%. We set production records at our West Point, Seminole and Florence mills. The solid commercial and operating results were partially offset by the negative impact of inflation.","Overall, North American corrugated segment shipments were flat compared to the prior-year period, as strong gains in our domestic mill and box shipments offset lower export and pulp shipments. North American adjusted EBITDA margins were 18.8%. This was an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year and 290 basis points sequentially.","North American per day box shipments increased by 5.7% compared to last year and was 4.2% when excluding recent acquisitions. The 4.2% increase was driven by our commercial team and strong demand in consumer, e-commerce and selected food service markets.","Our export containerboard shipments of 260,000 tons were 16% below last year and 22% below the March quarter. This intentional shift of tons from lower margin export accounts to more profitable domestic customers favorably impacted overall price mix.","With the recent acquisitions, we\u2019ve increased our integration and we will continue to optimize our channel mix. We expect that going forward, our annual export volume will be less than 1 million tons as compared to 1.2 million tons for the trailing 12 months ending June.","We took approximately 45,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the quarter and no containerboard economic downtime. It\u2019s worth noting that in the year-ago period, we took 72,000 tons of economic downtime.","Inventory levels remained flat as compared to the prior quarter. In the September quarter, we expect to increase our inventory position by approximately 70,000 tons so that we consistently achieve high on-time delivery rates to our customers as we prepare for upcoming mill maintenance outages in the first half of fiscal 2018.","In July, WestRock\u2019s average daily box volumes increased 10% compared to last year and 6% when excluding newly acquired companies. We\u2019ve got the right momentum in our North American Corrugated Packaging business.","Our joint venture with Grupo Gondi performed well in the June quarter. The paper and packaging markets in Mexico are growing, and our partners at Grupo Gondi are investing to meet this growing demand. Gondi is expanding its box plant capacity across the country.","Paper supply in Mexico is extremely tight and expansions are underway at our mills in Mexico City and Guadalajara. Gondi has announced plans to construct a new state-of-the-art 350,000-ton recycled lightweight containerboard mill, which will be the largest machine in Mexico.","This additional capacity will ensure Gondi is very well positioned for growth with their customers in Mexico. We expect the new mill to be completed by the end of 2019 and will have limited impact on the amount of virgin kraft liner that we provide to the joint venture.","Our Brazil team had another great quarter with 14.7% growth in corrugated box shipments versus industry growth of approximately 1%. EBITDA margins were 25% for the period, up 570 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points over the prior year.","Driven by our talented team, high-quality assets and positive markets, we continue to explore opportunities to improve and expand our presence in Brazil. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with how the WestRock Corrugated Packaging team performed during the June quarter.","Consumer Packaging team also performed extremely well in the June quarter. Overall shipments declined due to planned outages at Evadale and Demopolis, and this resulted in 47,000 less tons of pulp sold. Shipments of paperboard and converted products increased 18,000 tons or 2% on a year-over-year basis.","Industry backlogs have increased with CRB up 9% and SBS up 37% both on a year-over-year basis. Our backlogs have improved through the quarter and currently stand at between five weeks and six weeks on SBS and CNK and approximately two weeks on CRB.","Our markets are mixed with ongoing demand softness in processed foods, tobacco and commercial print, which is offset by strength in food service, liquid packaging, health and beauty markets. The beverage season has been solid with warmer than expected weather in Europe and parts of the United States.","We\u2019re winning through differentiation in our enterprise sales approach, which brings the best of WestRock\u2019s capabilities to create value for our customers. We\u2019re now at a $15 million annual revenue run rate for EnShield. This is our barrier-grade paperboard for grease and oil resistance. We\u2019ve also introduced a new fully compostable paperboard for hot drink cups and that\u2019s gaining a great deal of interest from our major food service converting customers.","We\u2019re winning with new machinery commitments from our largest beverage customers and from customers in the growing craft brew market, including we\u2019ve received our first orders for our 1210 Combo machine, which automates both solid fiber multipacks and corrugated trays into a single integrated solution. This is a great example of our ability to provide integrated solutions across our portfolio to our customers.","Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $230 million or 15% of sales. The year-over-year decline was a result of planned maintenance downtime, higher input cost and the flow-through from previously-published price reductions.","We\u2019re implementing published price increases across every grade as we enter fiscal 2018. Input cost inflation unfavorably impacted the segment by $29 million from cost increases in recycled fiber, chemicals and energy.","Our Consumer Packaging team delivered another strong productivity quarter with $50 million of improvement that helped offset cost inflation. We\u2019re realizing improvements from procurement savings, return-generating capital projects and converting footprint optimization.","And the Covington Mill team executed extremely well on productivity improvement projects and capital investments. This is a direct result of the Covington team\u2019s efforts with the production record they set during the quarter.","We have numerous opportunities to invest internally in our business, and our Board just approved a $57 million project to rebuild the cutter section of one of our paper machines at the Mahrt Mill. The rebuild includes a new carton box cutter. In addition to providing an attractive return, this investment will increase both the quality and flexibility of our production at the Mahrt Mill when it\u2019s completed in the spring of 2019.","Ward, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. In our Land and Development segment, we drove strong sales activity across raw land, industrial and commercial properties. We\u2019ve previously stepped up these assets to fair market value and realized no income in the quarter as sales prices were in line with previous estimates. I will remind you that last quarter we announced that Land and Development activity is excluded from adjusted EPS.","We\u2019re making very good progress on the remaining portfolio and believe that we\u2019ll recognize between $150 million and $175 million of after-tax proceeds in fiscal 2017. We remain committed to the previously mentioned range of between $275 million and $300 million in net after-tax proceeds by the end of fiscal 2018.","We delivered $94 million from productivity and synergy improvements in the quarter and are projecting an $825 million run rate by the end of the fiscal year. We believe that the $1 billion target will be reached by the end of June \u2013 of the June quarter of fiscal 2018.","We continue to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. During the quarter, we invested a $172 million in capital to maintain and improve our manufacturing assets and paid a $101 million in dividends to our stockholders. We ended the quarter with total debt, excluding the non-cash step-up, of $6.23 billion and pro forma leverage of 2.58 times, excluding the benefit of any future synergies.","It\u2019s worth noting that our qualified defined benefit pension plans are overfunded and allow us to allocate more capital to improve our business and return capital to shareholders. Our plans are overfunded more than $0.25 billion and require approximately $35 million in annual cash contributions around the world, with the majority of that being in Canada and in the U.K.","Our investment strategy is designed to protect our overfunded status. We have numerous opportunities to invest in our business and in additional M&A, and we expect to allocate more capital to these growth and margin improvement opportunities than in share repurchases over the near term.","We expect to modestly exceed the current target of $1.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year. I\u2019d like to point out that this goal, issued last November, has remained constant through one of the most rapidly changing business environments that we can remember. We\u2019re proud of our ability to meet our commitments to our stockholders and look forward to closing out the year on a strong note.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sequential adjusted earnings per diluted share higher than the $0.74 achieved in the third quarter. For purposes of modeling, we\u2019ve provided key sequential drivers that will impact the quarter.","First, we expect the benefit in the range of $65 million to $75 million of EBITDA from sales price increases, seasonally higher volumes, favorable mix and continued productivity gains.","Second, inflationary pressure from recycled fiber continues to impact our results. Based on our regional consumption mix, our average index price paid per ton for OCC in the second fiscal quarter was a $147. In the third fiscal quarter, that increased by $13 to a $160, in line with our expectations.","Note that the average July index price for WestRock was $177 per ton. Therefore, we expect an average cost per ton in the fourth quarter to increase sequentially by $15 to $20 per ton to between $175 and $180. However, noting the volatility that we\u2019ve seen this year, predicting recycled fiber cost remains difficult.","This assumption, when paired with chemicals and fuel costs, results in a sequential cost increase between $25 million and $30 million in the fourth fiscal quarter. Third, we anticipate aggregate incremental EBITDA of between $50 million and $55 million from the previously announced acquisitions.","Additional items that you will need to consider in your sequential modeling aggregate to approximately $0.13 to $0.14 negative impact to adjusted earnings per share. Increased interest expense is approximately $0.01 to $0.02 unfavorable. D&A will increase by $35 million per quarter from recent acquisitions to approximately $310 million per quarter for a $0.09 sequential impact.","We expect our adjusted earnings tax rate to be in the 33% to 33.5% range this quarter as compared to 30.9% in the third quarter for a $0.02 impact. The gain on ArborGen, slightly increased share count and other non-recurring items are a $0.01 negative sequential impact.","Finally, I anticipate that you will have questions about our expectations for fiscal 2018. As we enter our third year as WestRock, I\u2019m pleased with the momentum that we have with our customers and across our businesses. We are finalizing our operating plan for next year, and we believe that we are well positioned to drive growth in EBITDA and operating cash flow.","We have attractive opportunities to invest in high-return capital projects that improve our competitiveness. With these opportunities, along with the addition of MPS, I expect capital investments in fiscal 2018 will be higher than the 750 million that we plan to invest in fiscal 2017. During our next earnings call, we will provide full year fiscal 2018 guidance. We will continue to be disciplined in our allocation of capital.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steven Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. We\u2019ve made substantial progress over the past two years transforming our portfolio and building a leader in paper and packaging. The WestRock team is well positioned and committed to working together to improve our margins, grow our cash flows and help our customers achieve their goals through our comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions and our strong execution.","We\u2019ll use our consistent and growing cash flow to reinvest in our business and make acquisitions that improve our business. We expect to return capital to stockholders by increasing our dividend over time and repurchasing shares within our target leverage ratio. I believe that this is a formula that provides significant opportunities for WestRock employees, customers and investors over the short and long term.","Matt, that concludes my prepared remarks. We\u2019re ready for Q&A.","Matt Tractenberg","Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience, please limit your questions to one with a follow-up, if needed. We\u2019ll get to as many as time allows. Jack, can you take our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning.","Brian Maguire","Steve, the box shipments continue to be at a little bit of a faster growth rate than you were in, in the recent couple of years I think up 4.2 organically, 5.7 with M&A. I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019d attribute the acceleration to, if you\u2019re seeing any particular end markets that are growing a little bit faster than others or regionally, if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d call out. And then maybe give us a little bit of color on how trends were in July?","Steven Voorhees","Okay. Jeff?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. Good morning, Brian. So I\u2019ll start with \u2013 in the quarter, we experienced growth in most of our market segments, notably pizza. And so you\u2019ll recall we just executed an acquisition of Star Pizza, which put us in the specialty pizza niche. We have a large share of large pizza and large franchises, but that was a place we didn\u2019t have. Also, we had a few promotional pieces with the big four that drove increased sales.","And then our food service packaging in general is up. We\u2019re well positioned in that market based on investments we\u2019ve made both in Star Pizza, high- speed rotary die cutters that are multiple colors and then our white top position in the markets. So that\u2019s helping us differentiate and grow sales effectively in that market.","Also, we continue to grow in segments enabled by EVOLs and our automated packaging system. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve seen in our retail and consumer segments. Although some of the larger companies aren\u2019t growing, we\u2019re penetrating that market based on investments we made and customers who value taking total cost out of their systems. And so our automated packaging systems give us the ability to take the back of the house, eliminate labor, reduce total cost and give them automated packaging solutions in their businesses.","And then finally, we continue to grow from e-commerce which again is up significantly. And we\u2019re benefited by our scale and then the platform investments we\u2019ve made again in EVOLs. We can run short runs, custom orders, long runs, small boxes. So we can run a mix of business on those Flexos from mini all the way up to 50-inch business. And it\u2019s really positioned us well in the markets. And over time, we expect to continue to grow.","Steven Voorhees","July?","Jeff Chalovich","July, I would say the same figures \u2013 we see the same segments growing. 10% is organic -- or 10% total, 6% organic in our business. The markets are strong in all of our channels; export, domestic and box. And we continue to grow with our customers. And we continue to execute new field basics [ph]. Our customers are pleased with what we\u2019re doing. We deliver high-quality boxes on time and complete, and we do the same thing in our market segments and channels in domestic and export. And our backlogs remain strong. Inventories are stable, but tight and our demand is strong in most of our segments.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks for that. Just one follow-up. Maybe this one\u2019s for Bob. Just with the inflation you\u2019ve had in OCC, it seems like a renewed effort from the industry to try and get some CRB pricing. And I know the one over the summer didn\u2019t meet with a lot of success. But maybe you can kind of comment on how those conversations are going now and what your kind of outlook is for CRB pricing over the next couple of months?","Robert Feeser","Hi, Brian, I can\u2019t comment on pricing related with our customers, but I can say that our CRB system is much stronger during this last quarter. We\u2019re seeing a bit of strength. But over the last four or five quarters, it\u2019s been very, very stable. So we like our CRB business quite a bit and we\u2019re continuing to take steps to strengthen the business.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details and congratulations on the progress. I guess my first question broadly is on acquisitions. You\u2019ve obviously acquired a number of businesses in paperboard converting over the last year, some very recent. Can you relay to us what findings you have thus far? Any surprises, either positive or negative relative to any of the businesses? Obviously, MPS is the largest. And if we think about the aggregate EBITDA that you\u2019ve acquired, what would you place it at? I know you said 50 million to 55 million incremental in the fiscal fourth quarter. But on a gross basis annualized, what do you think that EBITDA amounts to across all the businesses? And then I had a follow-on.","Steven Voorhees","This is Steve. I haven\u2019t done the math on what the aggregate EBITDA is that we\u2019ve acquired. Let\u2019s talk about the acquisition opportunities that we have. When we put WestRock together, the idea is that we were going to be able to grow the business. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. And the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made, I think fit extremely well with our portfolio. And they add to our portfolio. And really without exception, the opportunities that we have as a result of the acquisitions have been I think very positive.","And I\u2019d say \u2013 now we had an expectation that they\u2019d be positive. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have done the acquisitions. But the chemistry that we have as an organization that we\u2019re building, we\u2019ve been able to I think really combine our businesses and really enhance our overall portfolio. So I\u2019ve been very pleased with the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made. They\u2019ve been really on our business strategy. And really that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to say.","George Staphos","Okay.","Ward Dickson","And George, this is Ward. The contribution in the third fiscal quarter of the acquisitions, it was really only MPS and it was less than 15 million of EBITDA given the timing of the close. So you can take that and the sequential number to get the \u2013 get kind of a run rate. And then the contribution of the converting acquisitions; Star, U.S. Corrugated, Island Container and Hannapak, I would put that in the range of less than $40 million before synergies on an annual basis. And then you -- ","George Staphos","Understood.","Ward Dickson","Yes, you\u2019ll understand the EPS historical numbers \u2013 I mean the MPS historical numbers.","George Staphos","Correct, that\u2019s helpful, Ward. My second question and I\u2019ll turn it over. From our vantage point, the management of cost inflation was quite good. You were pretty much in line with your guidance from the third quarter I think which was \u2013 or the second quarter \u2013 for the third quarter of 125 million, yet it seemed like inflation pressures were more or less building over the course of the quarter. Can you remind us what you might have done to manage the inflation either through purchasing scale, fiber substitution, et cetera? And how important will price be as a lever to managing that going forward relative to past years, particularly in the boxboard piece? Thanks, guys.","Ward Dickson","George, this is Ward. I\u2019ll start with Q3 and talk about our outperformance versus the guidance. So really our price, box volumes and productivity were better than what we anticipated. I would say that the inflation just came in slightly above the high end of the range that we gave you in the quarter. And then clearly, the lower tax rate in ArborGen \u2013 the ArborGen gain contributed to the benefit and then our guidance at the beginning of the quarter excluded MPS. So the real driver for us in terms of the outperformance was stronger productivity, stronger volumes, stronger box volumes than we anticipated.","As you look at the year, I think it\u2019s incredible that we are able to maintain the $1.2 billion free cash flow guidance. If you go back to the inflation guidance that I gave on raw material at the beginning of the year, I said it was going to be $175 million to $200 million. And as we go through Q4, that number is going to approach $400 million. And we\u2019ve been able to maintain the free cash flow guidance because we\u2019ve been able to drive stronger volumes and we\u2019ve realized price increases across all of our businesses.","And in addition, we\u2019ve generated more productivity than what we expected at the beginning of the year. To me, it reinforces the need for us to constantly drive productivity across our businesses and also the commercial excellence that we demonstrate by focusing on markets that we think that we can win in.","George Staphos","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari","Hi. Good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari","In containerboard, a number of your competitors have talked about debottlenecking opportunities and given some tonnage figures on the recent calls. Given you and the industry appear to be running close to full out, do you plan to add any capacity in your current mill footprint?","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Anthony. It\u2019s Jeff. So currently, we like the position we\u2019re in and see our best opportunities to increase free cash flow and our North American EBITDA margins by further integrating our North American box system with our mill system, and then continue to invest in our mill system to reduce our cost profile. We just executed three acquisitions in the last four months to enable us to further integrate our capital investments in the box plant system, support that integration and growth with our customers. And we continue to invest in the mill system to reduce our cost profile.","We have good optionality to manage our channel mix and reduce the tail of our least profitable channels and export and move that into North American domestic and box shipments. So we\u2019re well positioned I think to provide our customers with differentiated products, innovative solutions. And we\u2019re going to continue to execute that strategy and disciplined capital execution plan. And we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to compete and win in the market, regardless of what happens from other investments sometime in the future.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Ward, in the 4Q guidance, you gave a 65 million to 75 million benefit from vol, price mix and productivity. Understanding these are all ranges and that they\u2019re going to move around in the quarter, is it possible to roughly say how much you would split into those three buckets of the 65 million to 75 million?","Ward Dickson","The largest bucket is the pricing benefit for the continued implementation of the previously published price increases, specifically across our corrugated segment. So that\u2019s by far the largest bucket, followed by the sequential productivity and then the smallest would be the incremental volume.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Gabe Hajde","Good morning, gentlemen. This is actually Gabe sitting in for Chris. A quick question on the consumer business. I think it was earlier this week there was an announcement from the FDA about tobacco products. Just curious if you could parse out what piece of the consumer business has exposure there. I think most of it is in the SBS side, but \u2013 and I appreciate some of that\u2019s international. But just give us a sense for maybe how those volumes have been tracking and how much of that business is exposed there? Thanks.","Jeff Chalovich","Yes, the majority of our tobacco SBS business is international. It\u2019s roughly 80% of the total that we do. And the volumes have been relatively stable. Clearly, there is sequential decline \u2013 or secular decline in the market overall. We play in pockets of the market that are very much in the premium high-end brands of tobacco. And we have identified opportunities to grow the business in China, in particular. So those are areas that have been important to maintain our volume profile in the tobacco market.","Gabe Hajde","Okay. And perhaps maybe this is for Steve. But just \u2013 you mentioned some opportunities too in Brazil in the corrugated operations to either improve or expand. Can you elaborate on that a little bit for us?","Steven Voorhees","Yes, Jim Porter\u2019s here. I\u2019m going to let Jim take that question.","James Porter","Good morning, Dave. First of all, we really love our Brazil business. We\u2019ve got just an outstanding team and a strategy and an asset portfolio in Brazil that really continues to execute extremely well. Brazil is an attractive market for us with over 200 million people consuming products that need our packaging solutions every day. And we are focused on expanding in that region beyond our current organic capabilities, and we have several projects that are under consideration. I\u2019d have to say the growth in our corrugated packaging capability is our current priority.","Gabe Hajde","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Wilde","Good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","I\u2019d like to come back to the \u2013 on that CapEx and debottlenecking question, because it sounded like from Jeff\u2019s commentary that the focus in kind of containerboard is going to continue to be on increasing integration and taking out costs rather than increasing supply at all. And I wondered if you could confirm that.","Jeff Chalovich","I think you summarized it. This is Jeff. Mark, I think you summarized it very well.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then, Ward, just a point of clarification. I think you just mentioned $15 million in benefit from incremental EBITDA coming out of MPS. But in the slide deck, the number is 5 million. So can you help us reconcile that?","Ward Dickson","Is that the segment income or EBITDA? It\u2019s MPS and other. So there\u2019s some \u2013 if you look on the consumer bridge, there\u2019s $14 million of EBITDA from MPS. There\u2019s $2 million of negative foreign exchange and there are some of the costs associated with the maintenance outage that we\u2019ve had. So that\u2019s the reconciliation.","Mark Wilde","Okay, all right, that\u2019s fine. Last question, I just wondered, Steve, the announcement that we had about four weeks ago from David S. Smith about their entry into North America. I wondered if you could give us some thoughts on that. I think you guys have had a relationship, some technology sharing, with David S. Smith. And I\u2019d like to know whether this deal changes that relationship.","Steven Voorhees","Jeff is closest to that relationship, so I\u2019m going to let Jeff respond.","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, Mark. No, it doesn\u2019t change the relationship at all. We continue to work with them in the machine space, and we\u2019ll continue to do so.","Mark Wilde","Okay, very good. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. I was hoping to get more color on containerboard export markets and maybe understand a little bit more as you\u2019re repatriating more tons. Is that sort of evenly across the different export markets, or are you taking it out of one region versus another? And are there different pricing and market dynamics in the different regions that maybe speak to that?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, Mark. It\u2019s Jeff. Our preponderance of our export is still Latin America \u2013 Mexico, Latin America and that remains the same. And then we have \u2013 it\u2019s almost two-thirds of our export. And then we have some smaller positions in Asia, Europe. So we\u2019re really concentrating on Latin America, Western Europe. We\u2019re moving into Eastern Europe a bit and then a small amount in Asia. We\u2019ve exited some markets in Africa \u2013 sum of customers more specifically in the specific markets, including all the ones I\u2019ve just called out. And really it\u2019s that tail of the export. I\u2019d refer you to what Pulp & Paper\u2019s published on pricing and that would give you a guide of the different areas in pricing. And we have executed, as we said on previous calls, price increases in those areas. And again, we are managing the tail of that channel.","Mark Weintraub","Great. I believe that there are some new pricing initiatives in Europe on the kraft linerboard side. Are we seeing anything of that sort in the Latin American or Mexican markets?","Jeff Chalovich","I can\u2019t really speak to the future pricing. You\u2019ve seen what was published in Europe. Then we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens in the other markets.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Dillon","A question I had was \u2013 the first one is I think, Ward, you all laid out the increase in the cost saves you expect. You expect to go from a 760 I believe, you said, annual run rate now to 825 at the end of the fiscal year or just this quarter. So that would suggest about a $17 million absolute improvement, you divide that difference by 4. And I\u2019m just wondering in the guidance bridge, is that 17 million an offset to the cost pressures or is that part of the $65 million to $75 million number? I\u2019m just trying to figure out where that 17 is?","Ward Dickson","So when you try to bridge from run rate to sequential earnings changes, it\u2019s not that elegant. So we can actually execute a project in the last two weeks of the quarter, and we capture it into the run rate. And so again, we will have some sequential productivity improvements from the actions that we\u2019ve had. We\u2019ve embedded it in the guidance, but it\u2019s not as precise as you described.","Chip Dillon","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And then the last one \u2013 second one is looking at the consumer area; two things. One, I think, Steve, you mentioned the backlog in CRB was two weeks, which I either misheard you but that strikes me as a little bit low. And then secondly, you mentioned the Mahrt project that will come on in about I guess 18 or so months. How much downtime will that involve? And when do you expect that downtime to occur?","Steven Voorhees","Bob?","Robert Feeser","Chip, so the two weeks that we\u2019ve referenced on the backlogs for CRB is a pretty normal level for us and it\u2019s in part just how we manage our internal system, which is a big driver of the backlogs. But we have in general seen a bit of firming over the last quarter. And then on the Mahrt project, we\u2019re really excited about this opportunity to really improve the quality of our product overall and provide more flexibility to the market in general. And that project will be completed during an outage in March of 2019, and it\u2019s roughly about a 28-day outage that will take place on that machine in March of 2019.","Chip Dillon","Got you, very helpful. Real quickly, I noticed that a major or small for North America producer of corrugated packaging announced a pretty large box plant in New Jersey. It looks like it\u2019s going to eat up about 200,000 tons. Obviously, I\u2019m talking Cascades. And that would mean for them an integration move that\u2019s pretty significant. Does that mean you might have more opportunities to sell board up from Solvay and I guess other mills in that general region on the open market, or otherwise do you see \u2013 how do you see that move impacting you all?","Jeff Chalovich","I\u2019m sorry, Chip. I missed the new corrugated place in New Jersey. I didn\u2019t hear what you said.","Chip Dillon","Yes. It was announced this morning. Maybe you didn\u2019t see it. But Cascades is announcing a plant that\u2019s going to create 2.4 billion square feet of boxes, which will be about 0.5% I guess of North America, and we would guess around 200,000 tons of cut-up in Piscataway. And so assuming that is true, which I\u2019m reading here, I would imagine that that eats up a lot of their board from their relatively new machine and some of their other capacity, it integrates it. So I just didn\u2019t know if that opens up more opportunities for you all with your very profitable Solvay Mill.","Jeff Chalovich","It\u2019s possible. We have a large position with our box plants currently there. But we\u2019re always looking at our mix and our customer base. And it\u2019s one of our most profitable channels, our domestic market. So we like that market. And I can\u2019t say yet, but I\u2019m sure that as we get more clarity, we\u2019ll be able to decide if that works in our system or not.","Chip Dillon","Okay. They\u2019re saying they\u2019re spending $80 million, so it\u2019s got to be a big one. Anyway, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng","Hi, guys. You\u2019ve made a few bolt-ons recently to enhance your integration level both from your consumer and corrugated side. Is there like a target integration level you would like to achieve over the medium term? And are you signing more opportunities in one segment versus the other?","Jeff Chalovich","Phil, I\u2019ll talk to the corrugated. We\u2019d like to move our integration level up to the 80% range and that would mean our export is basically down to 10%. We like the optionality with that to manage our mix and our channels and then the low ends of whatever channel there is there, we think it gives us more optionality. So we\u2019re targeting 80% in corrugated.","Steven Voorhees","Phil, the opportunities we have are balanced across our company. One of the benefits that we have at WestRock is we can look at opportunities in both consumer and corrugated and also across different geographies, like the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made are representative of that.","Philip Ng","Okay, that\u2019s great. And I guess longer term, bigger picture, looks like you\u2019re finding still pretty good capital projects with good returns. But longer term, to offset inflation as you wrap up this $1 billion synergy target, how should we think about productivity going forward?","Jeff Chalovich","I think to be successful and to offset normal inflation, we need to be in the $275 million to $300 million of annual productivity.","Ward Dickson","And I believe that we \u2013 this year we obviously have had spikes in energy and natural gas \u2013 I mean in OCC. But if you just look at a steady state ongoing wage inflation environment and input cost environment, it reinforces the need for us to constantly drive productivity. And my estimate would be a $275 million to over $300 million on an ongoing basis.","Philip Ng","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.","Matt Tractenberg","Jack, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Lars Kjellberg","Thank you. Just one question on the consumer board. As you continue to integrate significant volumes in that segment, can you bring us through the pricing dynamics as you raise prices for SBS, CRB, CNK, et cetera? And can you also confirm that your intention to convert pulp into more paperboard to continue to have the open market exposure that you\u2019ve had prior to MPS?","Robert Feeser","Lars, this is Bob Feeser. We can\u2019t comment on pricing, but \u2013 as we\u2019ve indicated that we see a great opportunity to integrate the 100,000 tons of paperboard consumption from MPS, and we\u2019ll continue to do that and reduce our overall production of pulp in our SBS system. That\u2019s a very attractive proposition for our business overall. And then clearly, additional paperboard-related acquisitions, we have additional headroom for future integration as well. But at the same time, we have very attractive business in the external market with very good converting customers that are very valued to us. So that will continue to be a very important part of our strategy overall.","Lars Kjellberg","So there is no formulistic pass-through of index prices into the carton side, or how should I think about that?","Robert Feeser","I\u2019m sorry.","Steven Voorhees","Lars, could you repeat that?","Lars Kjellberg","Similar to box prices, if there\u2019s no index for the Pulp & Paper Week price index transfer of higher board prices into cartons?","Matt Tractenberg","I\u2019m not sure we understand the question, Lars, but we can take it offline, okay?","Lars Kjellberg","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Adam Josephson","Hi. Good morning. Steve, just a question on e-commerce. I know you mentioned it was beneficial to your box demand in the quarter. You\u2019d previously said you thought overall box demand wouldn\u2019t significantly change as a result of the growth in e-commerce. And over the last year, it seems like box demand has really picked up, partly or if not mostly, on account of e-commerce. Do you think differently today than you perhaps did a year ago about the impact of e-commerce on the alignment? And relatedly, what do you think the impact of e-commerce growth has been on the ramp in OCC inflation that you talked about earlier?","Steven Voorhees","I\u2019m going to let Jeff talk about our expectations for e-commerce now. And then I\u2019ll talk about the impact on the recovered fiber stream after Jeff talks about the overall increase in demand in e-commerce.","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, Adam. ","Adam Josephson","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Chalovich","So e-commerce \u2013 good morning. There is an effect and it\u2019s on \u2013 it has been a net positive for corrugated, but I think it\u2019s important to talk about some the macroeconomic things going on in our business, because it\u2019s just not that. So the GDP in the second quarter was a healthy 2.6%. The ISM Purchasing Managers Index rose to 57.8 in June from 54.9 in May. So the index continues to indicate growth in the manufacturing sector. New Orders Index rose to 63.5 in June with 15 of those 18 industries reporting growth. And then the nondurable industrial production rose to 1.5% year-over-year, and that\u2019s after averaging 0.3% growth over the prior 12 months.","So there\u2019s growth in our segments, and we\u2019re seeing that across the board in some of these smaller food and beverage companies, even if things like Big Beard on craft beer is growing. Noncarbonated beverages are growing. So some of the reports of some of the large accounts or customers being down are really being offset by other pieces of the market. There\u2019s industrial growth. E-commerce is fueling it, and it\u2019s net positive. But there\u2019s a lot of other positives going on across multiple markets and segments.","Steven Voorhees","And just on the impact on e-commerce. We have a very nice recycling business, and we operate a number of facilities across the country. Four of those facilities are single-stream recycling facilities. They collect the entire recyclable stream from \u2013 so this would include pulp boxes, newspapers, plastics, aluminum. So the four facilities process 300,000 tons per year and we monitor the collections of OCC from these facilities because we obviously want to get that OCC integrated into our mills. And the collections from those facilities have grown by 8% over the past year. And it\u2019s not surprising because I think everybody is using corrugated packaging as it\u2019s intended to protect the products that they are shipping and it helps as a great way to market your product. And so that\u2019s coming into the homes and it\u2019s showing up in the waste room.","Adam Josephson","Got it. And just, Ward, one clarification. You\u2019re expecting no further OCC price increases from July. Is that right?","Ward Dickson","Yes, in the 175 to 180 range, we\u2019re at 177. So it would imply that it would be stable. Obviously, that will be an element of volatility to the forecast that we have for the quarter.","Adam Josephson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Your line is open.","Gail Glazerman","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just following up on that. If you don\u2019t necessarily think e-commerce is driving OCC, can you just talk fundamentally about what you think has driven it? And maybe taking kind of a medium-term view on where you see it going, do you think it can hold at these levels, not just this quarter, but moving forward? And how that changes how you think about your business?","Steven Voorhees","Yes, sure. So let\u2019s talk about this in kind of a broader perspective. Like if you look at world demand for containerboard, it\u2019s been growing at a low single-digit rate for the past several years. Like recently, we\u2019ve seen demand increase even faster. We\u2019ve seen box demand increased 3% in the U.S. the first six months of this year. Increasing demand for containerboard is served by OCC. And so far this year, we\u2019ve seen demand for OCC increase 5% worldwide, 3.6% in North America. And then China, it\u2019s increased by 7%. And as I said, increase in demand \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing changing supply trends because of e-commerce that we just spoke about. I think that helps \u2013 explains what\u2019s happened to prices.","Now in perspective, our average fiber price over the past 12 months, so this would be the 12 months ending June, was $130 per ton. That means at the current price, $177 per ton, and our annual consumption of 4.9 million tons, we\u2019re going to have fiber price headwinds to overcome for the next several quarters because the math would indicate that. Now over time, if you look at this on a [indiscernible] it looks like prices are high. And so we would expect there to be some moderation in the price over time. We don\u2019t have a clear crystal ball on that.","So I don\u2019t know where it would be between historical levels and current levels, but we\u2019d expect some moderation. So we look at that. We look at it carefully. If you think about the situation, it\u2019s like a nice problem to have because that means the driver is increased demand for paper and packaging. And that\u2019s our business. So we\u2019re participating in the demand trends. And I think paper and packaging are great products to serve attractive markets. And so that\u2019s where we are, Gail. And I think from WestRock\u2019s perspective, I really like our position because we\u2019re balanced. We\u2019re 60% virgin, 40% recovered fiber. And so we\u2019re well positioned to adapt to whatever scenario plays out.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Thank you. And just one last one. As you look to trying to drive integration in corrugated from 73% to towards 80%, just what type of open market opportunity in terms of that M&A that you\u2019ve been doing do you see remaining? And how much of that might have to be integrated and organic?","James Porter","Hi, Gail. It\u2019s Jim. So it\u2019s a mix of both. I think that if you look at roughly 70,000 tons is about 1 point for us. So yes, there is available M&A in the market. Although some of the independents; it\u2019s smaller, there are still opportunities in the market to expand. And then our box volumes are strong. We expect to be able to grow with the market organically. And we see the opportunity to get to the 80 as a realistic goal.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And I don\u2019t suppose you want to put a scale on what you see \u2013 what percentage you see as independent market at this point?","Jeff Chalovich","It\u2019s hard to say. There\u2019s multiple ways to look at it. The FBA looks at it \u2013 the independents that are tied to some type of containerboard mills and then there\u2019s not. So it\u2019s a 20-ish percentile range of independents and those that aren\u2019t tied to mills is 10 to 13. It\u2019s not an exact science, but there\u2019s 20% out there and over 10%, I would say, that aren\u2019t tied to boards that are still operating.","Matt Tractenberg","Jack, we\u2019re going to take one last question please.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Armstrong Investment. Your line is open.","James Armstrong","Good morning and thanks for fitting me in.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning.","James Armstrong","The first question is could you talk about the drivers in the Brazil business? That was actually a great number. I just was wondering, is that sustainable and could it continue to grow? And what are you doing different in that market?","Ward Dickson","Thank you, James. So as I said, we really are quite proud of our Brazil business. The team and the strategy and the assets just continued to perform extremely well against a very difficult backdrop. But that backdrop we think is improving. We are seeing signs that the business climate in Brazil is improving. And our EBITDA margins returned this quarter to its more normal 25%-ish range. And that\u2019s due to a very strong volume growth, realization of price increases, productivity.","We\u2019ve just got a lot of tools in that Brazilian business between our very high-performing forestry assets, literally the \u2013 one of the lowest-cost virgin containerboard mills in the world and a portfolio of packaging assets that are focused on differentiated packaging solution. So that combination really has produced a winning situation for us. And as we\u2019ve said, we look to continue to invest and grow in that market.","James Armstrong","Okay, that helps. And then switching \u2013 coming back to exports out of North America. Could you talk a little bit more about your long-term thinking, getting that down to 10%? Would there ever be a scenario where you want to be at zero exports, or do you think exports will be a continued strong part of your business?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, James. It\u2019s Jeff. I think exports will remain a strong part of the business. We don\u2019t want to be overexposed, but we like the markets. The world needs virgin kraft fiber. We supply it. So it just gives us optionality in the three channels that we supply and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.","Matt Tractenberg","Jack, I think that\u2019s all that we have time for today.","Operator","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the presenters.","Matt Tractenberg","Thank you. And thank you to our audience for joining the call today. As always, feel free to reach [Technical Difficulty]. Have a great day, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Marcella, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations.","James Armstrong","Thank you, operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining our fiscal first quarter 2020 earnings call. We issued our press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the right side of the application you are using to view this webcast.","With me on today\u2019s call are WestRock\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; our Chief Financial Officer, Ward Dickson; our Chief Commercial Officer and President of Corrugated Packaging, Jeff Chalovich; as well as our Chief Innovation Officer and President of Consumer Packaging, Pat Lindner. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer session.","During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discussed during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filing with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call.","We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. As mentioned previously, the slide presentation is available on our website.","And with that said, I\u2019ll now turn it over to you Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, James. Good morning. Thank you for joining our fiscal first quarter 2020 earnings call. During the fiscal first quarter we made substantial progress executing our differentiated strategy and markets that are characterized by stable demand, increasing supply and customers with ever growing needs for innovative, sustainable packaging solutions.","WestRock while positions to meet these needs with our comprehensive portfolio of fiber-based packaging solutions. This is demonstrated by another quarter of growth of our sales to more than 160 customers buying at least $1 million from each of our segments. These customers now represent an annual rate of sales of $7.5 billion or 40% of our total sales. During the quarter our sales increased 2.2% to $4.4 billion mainly due to the addition of KapStone.","Our adjusted segment EBITDA of $675 million was within the guidance expectations that we provided in November. Our capital investments of $375 million in the quarter included $132 million for strategic projects and these projects include our new Florence paper machine and to upgrade of our of container board now in Brazil. We expect this most recent quarter to be the high-water mark for our capital expenditures for this fiscal year.","We expect our CapEx to decline next fiscal year to an annual rate of $900 million to $1 billion on an ongoing basis. During this past year, we\u2019ve completed our strategic investments at our Covington and Mahrt mills and at our box plant in Porto Feliz. The projects to be completed this fiscal year include our Florence paper machine in the North Charleston mill reconfiguration. While these investments have negatively impacted our results in this quarter these projects will deliver substantial benefits in the near and long-term for our company.","As these projects ramp up, we expect they will deliver an additional $85 million in annual run rate EBITDA at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter and a total of $175 million in cumulative annual run rate EBITDA by the end of fiscal 2021. We expect to increase this run rate when the Tres Barras upgrade is fully operational in fiscal 2022. This along with the accretion of KapStone benefits will provide productivity benefits that will sustain our financial results and cash flow generation.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4, adjusted segment EBITDA decreased by $58 million year-over-year. The EBITDA decline from the prior year was the result of the flow through of previously published price changes, lower export in domestic containerboard and kraft paper prices and lower global pulp prices. The decline in pricings is partially offset by input cost deflation, the benefits of ongoing productivity initiatives and the additional month of KapStone\u2019s results.","We had a relatively high scheduled maintenance outage quarter with 146,000 tons of downtime across our North American mill system. This is more than double the amount of maintenance downtime that we had in the same quarter last year. We generated $453 million of adjusted operating cash flow in the quarter. This was up $105 million from the prior year. In fiscal 2019, our adjusted free cash flow was more than $1 billion and we expect to sustain that $1 billion in free cash flow during the course of fiscal 2020.","We\u2019re focusing on executing our differentiated strategy with our commercial excellence, operational excellence and digital programs that will result in profitable organic growth and productivity improvements and generate cash flow that will return our leverage ratio to our 2.25 times to 2.50 times target.","Turning to our corrugated packaging segments. Sales for the fiscal first quarter were $2.9 billion this was an increase of 6.4% over the last year and was primarily due to the KapStone acquisition. When North American corrugated packaging adjusted EBITDA margins were 19.3%. This decline versus the prior year was driven primarily by lower domestic and export containerboard, kraft paper and pulp pricing and was partially offset by lower fiber and energy cost and the additional month of KapStone results.","Industry operating rates improved from 91.8% in the fiscal fourth quarter to 94.1% in the fiscal first quarter. Similar to our first quarter January demand in our North American business is stable year-over-year and backlog across domestic export and box are solid. Demand from ecommerce continues to grow at a double-digit pace. Despite the stable demand that we\u2019ve experienced earlier this month PPW price watch price reduction $10 per ton on domestic linerboard and $15 per ton on domestic medium.","Our fiscal first quarter included 110,000 tons of maintenance downtime and no containerboard economic downtime. Inventories across our system are in balance and our integration rate for the quarter was 78%, 2% higher than a year ago. Our long-term integration rate target is 90%. In September, we announced the reconfiguration of the North Charleston Mill which included the permanent shutdown of a paper machine earlier this month that reduced our linerboard capacity by 288,000 tons.","We expect to achieve the $40 million in annual run rate benefits by the end of the calendar year. This transition impacted adjusted segment EBITDA by $10 million due to higher operating cost and lower sales volume. The new paper machine at our Florence mill remains unscheduled and is scheduled to begin operation during the first half of this calendar year. The machine installation and construction are nearing completion. We\u2019re wrapping up the remaining work necessary to transition to commissioning efforts.","Our box shipments grew 4.5% on a per day basis. This includes an additional month of KapStone. We\u2019re helping our customers win in their markets. Our ability to win with customers is enabled by continued investments in the most modern, high speed, low cost, corrugators and converting equipment in the industry. We\u2019re delivering high quality products on time and infill [ph] to customers in solving their critical challenges. We\u2019re bringing a multi-faceted set of solutions to our local, national and global customers that include the most comprehensive portfolio of converted, lightweight, 100% recycled and virgin liners and cutted [ph] white top and specialty kraft liners.","The investments in right sizing technology, by box on demand and box sizer enabled our customers to reduce their packaging invoiced, help achieve their sustainability goals and dramatically reduce their shipping, manufacturing and total supply chain cost. Our containerboard product portfolio and machinery enable us to customize our packaging to meet the specific needs of our customers for the lightest weight, [indiscernible] sized and most sustainable packaging solutions that can reduce their fiber usage by up to 40%.","We have unrivaled scale and a full suite of graphics capabilities. They include the most modern pre-print operation, pre-eminent display business in North America. These capabilities enable our customers to revitalize, reinvent or launch new brands at scale.","Now turning to Brazil. Brazil\u2019s first quarter of adjusted EBITDA of $22 million was negatively impacted by the ramp up of Porto Feliz. This plant operates the first pre-print machine in South America which is now providing the opportunity for customers in this region to differentiate their packaging with exceptional graphics. While still a small portion of the plants volume, our pre-print capability supporting our growth in the market. We expect to increase production and sales over the remainder of fiscal 2020. Tres Barras expansion project is on track for startup in the first half of calendar 2021.","Moving to Slide 6, the consumer packaging segment reported sales of $1.5 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA of $184 million. Shipment volumes in the quarter of 922,000 tons were down 47,000 tons as compared to the prior year. Over the past nine months, we\u2019ve had extended outages at our Covington and Mahrt mills in order to complete our strategic capital projects. We\u2019ve also conducted major scheduled maintenance outages at these mills in the fiscal first quarter. These outages and the inventory destocking by our converting customers negatively impacted sales volumes especially in the food, food service and beverage and markets.","Market driven reductions in pulp prices the impact of 36,000 tons of scheduled maintenance outages impacted our results. The first quarter was our peak maintenance outage quarter across our consumer mill system. Shipments of converted products were stable with growth in food service and beverage end markets partially offset by some softness in branded, consumer shipments and Europe and Asia. We also saw a reduction of shipments during the holiday shutdown period from some of our large branded customers.","Consumer demand for sustainable packaging continues to gain momentum. For example, we\u2019ve commercialized fiber based pressed trays to eliminate foam and perishable food applications such as meat trays. We\u2019re also converting beverage customers from plastic high cone and shrink wrap, to paperboard packaging solutions. We\u2019re extending our carton design, paper board materials and machinery capability to canned food applications where we\u2019re building a pipeline of opportunities to replace plastic shrink wrap.","Our ability to partner with customers on innovation the broadest portfolio of products is a key differentiator for WestRock. With strategic investments in our mill systems behind us, we expect the consumer packaging segment to improve its financial performance. We\u2019re striving to achieve our medium term target of 18% EBITDA margin in this segment.","In 2016, when we formed the WestRock we supplied 102 customers that bought at least $1 million from each of our corrugated and consumer packaging businesses for a total of $4.7 billion. Since 2016, we\u2019ve grown this group of customers to 161 with $7.5 billion in annual sales. This is a 60% increase. These customers value our broad portfolio of paper and packaging solutions and the ability that WestRock has to partner with them to solve their most critical challenges.","Our machinery business is a key component to this enterprise effort. We\u2019ve placed more than 100 machines during the quarter. This brings our total machine placements to more than 3,700. When you combine all of WestRock\u2019s capabilities with a full range of paper grade and folding carton, label and insert capabilities that we have across our company. There isn\u2019t a packaging company that\u2019s better positioned than WestRock to create customized, environmentally sustainable solutions for customers that help them reduce their total cost, some more products, minimize their risk and reduce their environment impact.","Sustainability continues to be a very important topic for all of our stakeholders. Many of our customers are making long-term commitments to use packaging that\u2019s a 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable. Our partnership with Santa Monica Seafood demonstrates how WestRock\u2019s broad portfolio can enable the customer\u2019s shift to more sustainable packaging. They ship fresh fish around the world. These shipments have to stay cold from the plant to the customer. They were using hard foam packaging and non-recyclable gel cooling packs.","Santa Monica Seafood needed a machinery and packaging combination that would make their cold supply chain more sustainable and efficient. We designed a corrugated package that\u2019s recyclable and maintains the critical temperature control needed without the use of the additional cooling materials like gel packs. We\u2019ve then designed and installed the tray forming equipment needed to handle this new sustainable package resulting in lower labor cost for this customer. This is a great example of how we\u2019re combining our innovative packaging solutions with machinery to create a cost effective and efficient solution for our customers.","Another example, how we\u2019re helping our customers shift to sustainable packaging as our success in replacing plastic makeup palette with a premium paper based palette. We\u2019ve created a new high quality paper palette with the visual, structural and technical characteristics that make at the ideal paper based package for the luxury, beauty markets. This design recently received the Paper and Packaging Council\u2019s Gold Award.","WestRock\u2019s innovative solutions in paper based packaging position us well to partner with our customers to reduce the environmental impact of packaging and help them meet their ambitious goals to use more recyclable, reusable and compostable packaging.","Ward, I\u2019ll turn it over to you now.","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. On Slide 10, we outline our key assumptions for our fiscal second quarter and full year 2020 guidance. We expect adjusted segment EBITDA in the fiscal second quarter to be between $680 million and $710 million. Sequentially we expect modest seasonal volume increases across both segments. The January 2020 PPW linerboard and medium index reductions will have some impact on our domestic pricing in the quarter. Productivity improvements and lower sequential healthcare cost should more than offset higher sequential wage cost and the payroll tax reset that occurs at the beginning of each calendar year.","Our second quarter guidance includes an adjusted tax rate of approximately 27.5% compared to 24% in the first quarter due to the timing of discrete items. We still expect our fiscal 2020 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24.5% and our full year cash tax rate forecast remains at 21%. We are maintaining our full year guidance of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion of adjusted segment EBITDA. We expect to invest a total of $1.1 billion in capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 and should generate more than $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow this year.","As we complete our strategic capital projects, we anticipate that we will return to $900 million to $1 billion annual CapEx level in fiscal 2021. Due to the seasonality of our cash flows with our strongest cash flows in our fiscal third and fourth quarter. We expect net leverage to peak in the fiscal second quarter before declining in the second half. We remained focused on reducing debt and returning to our target leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.5 times. We settled our insurance claim related to Hurricane Michael\u2019s impact to our Panama City mill.","In the quarter we recovered $32 million, $12 million of which was business interruption related and included in our EBITDA. We have now closed out this claim with our insurer and have recovered $212 million. I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Steve for some closing comments.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks Ward. We\u2019re making substantial progress executing our differentiated strategy as we proactively respond to a changing industry environment. We have increasing opportunities in the market for value added paper and packaging solutions that help our customers grow their sales, reduce their total cost in risk, all while helping them achieve their sustainability goals. We\u2019re looking to the future as we\u2019re investing in our business and in our people for the long-term. We\u2019re building our systems and processes, take advantage of the scale of our platform.","We\u2019re using digital technology to enhance our customer experience, improve our operating efficiency and better engage our team mates. We\u2019ve moved past the peak period of investment and to a period of capturing the benefits of our strategic projects, growing organically, driving productivity and generating free cash flow. The combination that will create value for our customers, stock holders and team mates for the long-term.","Now that concludes my prepared remarks, James, we\u2019re ready for Q&A.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience to give everybody a chance to ask a question, please limit your question to one with a follow-up, if needed. We\u2019ll get to as many as time allows. Operator, can we have our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from First Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Chip Dillon","I don\u2019t know if you gave us a lot of detail on this but could you just tell us the process of the switch over at Florence when the new machine, you throw the switch and how much of transition or how much of a magnitude of transition cost and operating disruption you expect and kind of when you think things are going to be operating normally there?","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Chip. It\u2019s Jeff. So we expect in the quarter before the mid-year that will be operating putting paper through the machine and the ramp up runs through the fiscal year, so we should leave September, October at a run rate the capability of the machine laid in that fourth quarter and so it\u2019s just normal startups but we\u2019re finishing up in this before mid-year a lot of the wirings and novel machines in, piping, wiring, some of the finishing touches. But it\u2019s progressing well.","Ward Dickson","Chip, this is Ward. I\u2019ll remind you that, I gave the financial impact of the disruption to the mill both in the Florence and Tres Barras when we gave our guidance on the call last quarter for the full year and I estimated that would between $35 million and $50 million in FY20.","Q \u2013 Chip Dillon","Okay, with presumably no change and a quick follow-up. I know in the last in the 10-K and this I believe was the first we had seen, you talk about some call arrangements tied to the Grupo Gondi investment and just any comments about how that joint venture is going and I mean strategically what we expect you to be more likely to buy their position relative to selling your position back to them?","Steve Voorhees","We\u2019ve had the joint venture in place for several years. They\u2019re putting call rates [ph]. I think the big project that\u2019s going on, is the paper machine in Monterey which is on a comparable schedule to the one to the Florence machine. We like our partnerships and first, I think it\u2019s worked very well. So I think is it more likely for us to increase or decrease our interest say overtime it\u2019s more likely for us to increase our interest.","Q \u2013 Chip Dillon","That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from BofA Securities. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 George Staphos","I wanted to work on the enterprise sales approach, you see what progress you think you\u2019re having beyond and numbers that you discussed and in particular to see, kind of as the follow-on, whether it\u2019s having the desired impact on consumer that you\u2019d like even that you mentioned in the commentary that you\u2019re striving for your 18% goal which means that may or may not be achieved. So first of all, you provided numbers for the quarter I think you had a $7.5 million [ph] cumulative rate that grew about 3% from the fourth fiscal quarter. Jeff will you please \u2013 with that performance in terms of the growth and revenues from the customers buying a $1 million each from you and it seems like it\u2019s not really kind of my second question. It seems like it\u2019s not having quite the same effect on margin and consumer. Would you agree or disagree and what do you need to strive and ultimately achieve that goal and that\u2019s probably more for Pat. Thank you guys.","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, George. So, yes, I was pleased with the progress of the team and I think we\u2019re well positioned with the accounts that we have \u2013 that have either a $1 million in each segment already are the ones that don\u2019t quite have a $1 million in one segment and have over $1 million in the other. The customers are finding value in the solutions set we bring, so being able to optimize primary, secondary, tertiary package through the supply chain machines, combo machines and beverage that do both corrugated and folding.","We\u2019ve had some large wins on both segments and I\u2019ll let Pat talk about some of the consumer. But I think as we put enterprise leads in each of our segments and divisions and our sales force really combined us teams with machine reps, graphics reps, marketing reps, we have a full complement of teams in these customers and we\u2019re approaching is as one WestRock. So the growth has been good and I think we have continued upside in all of the segments that we provide and we see customers taking advantage from display, consumer, corrugated our machinery businesses and we look to run more than just beverage machinery and look at cartooning equipment. I think we have more opportunity to grow across those top customers that have opportunities for over $1 million each and then I\u2019ll let Pat talk about the consumer a bit.","A \u2013 Pat Lindner","Thanks Jeff. So let me talk a little bit about the margins that you asked about and we still expect to meet the 18% EBITDA run rate in the coming years and I\u2019ll just share a couple of the key elements of that. First of all, our margins have been negatively impacted and suppressed by some of the strategic outages that we\u2019ve had and these are really important parts of our plan to get to 18% because we wanted to increase the productivity in those mills and we expect to get about $36 million of run rate by the end of fiscal year 2021. So they are very important part and while they impacted our near term results very important part of the margin improvement and connecting back to enterprise sales. This gets really to our innovation capability around plastics replacement and we continue to see strong demand there in beverage, food service as well as in food and we\u2019ve so far delivered $115 million run rate since we\u2019ve started tracking this about 15 months ago and we\u2019re on track to deliver that $400 million and that we\u2019ve shared before and as Jeff said, enterprise sales is a really important part to consumer on its innovation, we\u2019ve had customers around plastic replacement really ask for combined solution between corrugated and consumer and we see that being a really important part of differentiator. So with our productivity as well as our innovation capabilities everything that we\u2019re doing, we do have confidence and certainly expect 18%.","Q \u2013 George Staphos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Mark Wilde","I wanted to ask about two kind of global issues right now. One is the impact of the Coronavirus on your business. I think this is probably more for Pat, I know MPS has a lot of business and kind of premium goods the kind of stuff that moves through Dutyfree shops. The other issue right now I\u2019m wondering about, is whether you\u2019re seeing any impact from the Finnish, pulp and papers strike. They export a lot of containerboard, they export a lot of SBS.","Steve Voorhees","Mark, I can speak to you, China. For perspective, we employed about 900 people in China. Our annual sales are between $100 million to $150 million and I think you may know this. But the China government has announced extending Chinese New Year until February 2. Shanghai has announced it. All companies won\u2019t restart until February 10. We have plants in Wuxi [ph] and Kushan [ph] that are in that same general area and so they won\u2019t restart until February 10 and then we have a plant in Guangzhou [ph]. They haven\u2019t released a similar notice. So we\u2019re planning to go back to work there February 3.","We\u2019re supporting our employee, we\u2019ve shipped masks there and I think we\u2019re just monitoring that situation pretty carefully. I don\u2019t have a comment on your second question. I don\u2019t know, [indiscernible] Jeff?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. We haven\u2019t seen anything as of this point in time. Mark and I, export. No difference from our demand and backlog in pulp or exports based on strike.","Q \u2013 Mark Wilde","All right, then Steve just back on that Coronavirus. So you\u2019re not picking up anything from any of your customers right now about slowing in demand or any thoughts in production schedules because of potential slowing.","Steve Voorhees","We haven\u2019t so far.","Q \u2013 Mark Wilde","Okay, I will turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Brian Maguire","Jeff, I know you guys talked about the box shipment growth being about 4.5% including the acquisitions. I think in the past you kind of gave us more of an organic number without KapStone and some of the other acquisitions. I was just wondering if you could provide that and maybe within that just sort of comment on how trends ended the quarter and sort of what you\u2019re seeing in January so far.","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Brian. So just the KapStone was the 4.5%. This was the last quarter going forward organic will be all inclusive. We were up 0.015% [ph] in the aggregate for WestRock organic and I start with aggregate because at the end of the month in December 31, New Year\u2019s Eve day was counted as an [indiscernible] but it was really, we had of over 80% of our plants down and not shipping that matched what our customers were. So the per day was flat, but on the aggregate, we were up a 1.5 leaving that organically for WestRock and then going forward it will all be organic sales. January is flat year-over-year and its right on top of basically what we expected for the month.","Q \u2013 Brian Maguire","Great and I think last quarter and, in your guidance, assumed you\u2019d be running maybe I think 200 basis points above [indiscernible] something that ball park is that, still the target or expectation that we\u2019ve kind of been running above NFP [ph] growth rates.","Jeff Chalovich","Our plan is to continue to outgrow and we said would grow, 1% to 2% this year growth above the industry [ph].","Q \u2013 Brian Maguire","Okay, that\u2019s it from me. I\u2019ll turn it over thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Anthony Pettinari","Just following up on Brian\u2019s question on demand with regards to $10 a ton cut the pulp and paper week published. It sounds like that necessarily reflect what you were seeing with regard to kind of firm demand. Is that fair to say and is there anything you kind of expand on that a little?","Jeff Chalovich","Anthony, sure. I was surprised honestly in the cut. We had seen some pressure in our kraft paper more than our container board and we had seen the kraft paper and some of the recycled. So I was surprised that it wasn\u2019t recycled versus virgin kraft and there had been some looseness and medium. But our export volume, our domestic volumes in box were all good in the quarter and our export pricing was flat quarter-over-quarter. So I was surprised by the move in PPW honestly. [Indiscernible] and operating rates. Inventories are in good shape and operating rates were good, so I was surprised.","Q \u2013 Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful color and then maybe question for Ward since you issued the 2020 guidance pulp and paper week is obviously published as cut. I\u2019m just wondering which offset whether it\u2019s productivity or cost that\u2019s kind of offsetting that for you and what gives you confidence in sort of maintaining the guide that despite you [indiscernible].","Ward Dickson","Our original guidance has included assumptions on pricing, volumes and costs and we provided a range because we thought there could be a range of outcomes on each one of those individual assumptions. And based on what we see today across both our synergy attainment, our ability to capture volume and commodity cost we\u2019re still comfortable maintaining the full year range. So it\u2019s a combination of all the factors.","Q \u2013 Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Mark Weintraub","Perhaps Ward, is there any additional potential price erosion embedded in the ranges now or is that cushion now somewhat gone and then just as addendum. Last year I know there was a lot of skepticism when you laid out the EBITDA and people look at the first half and how can you possibly get there in the second and you basically did. How much of the improvement that you\u2019re expecting this year or sort of seasonality versus the projects etc. that you have underway that are going to really deliver in the second versus the first half.","Ward Dickson","So I can give you a clear answer to your first question which I can\u2019t comment to you on forward pricing. We\u2019ve taken all on any individual assumption. We\u2019re comfortable with the overall range that includes price volume and cost and productivity. In relationship to the first half and the second half I told you, last year I think our profile was approximately 45% in the first half and 55% of our EBITDA was in the second half when we gave guidance for this full year we said the same thing and whether it\u2019s 44% and 46% that profile remains the same and it does reflect both seasonal volume increases that we have in the second half acceleration of synergies and productivity. The elimination most of our downtime is in the first half of the year, it\u2019s a reflection of all those that drive the first half to second half profile.","Q \u2013 Mark Weintraub","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens Inc. your line is open.","Q \u2013 John Rider","This is John Rider for Mark. First question is, can you just give us an update how you\u2019re thinking about backlogs and consumer in aggregate. They\u2019ve fallen fairly steadily and a lot of investors have been asking us whether that means we may be running a higher risk that negative growth is coming back. And if you could just help us understand what you\u2019re seeing in your order flow in the each of the three substrates.","A \u2013 Pat Lindner","Yes, thanks for the question. This is Pat. I think when you look in the backlog there\u2019s a couple different factors. But I think the primary one really is that the independent folding carton converters have been destocking over the last I would say four to six months and this is data that\u2019s available from the Paperboard Packaging Council which has shown the drawn down of inventory that those converters and this is, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the end market demand so much. But through a number of the supply issues across CRB, CNK and SBS in the industry. You saw in 2018 and 2019, you saw probably some inventory build which is now getting corrected and so we think that\u2019s the biggest issue is really just the destocking and as far as going forward it\u2019s a little bit early to tell in the year. But we\u2019re cautiously optimistic based on what we\u2019re seeing that some of the destocking will be past us and that we\u2019ll see slightly increased volumes in the second quarter and increasing throughout the year.","Q \u2013 John Rider","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful and then just our final one. So we\u2019re seeing published OCC prices at exceptionally well levels. We\u2019re just curious so your actual OCC cost is low relative to the past as the published figures are?","Ward Dickson","If you look at our earnings bridge, you can see the cost deflation that we have, a large driver of that has been the decline in OCC so our OCC cost and recycled fiber cost do match the indices and what we embedded in our full year guidance, when we gave at the beginning of the year was a $15 per ton year-over-year reduction on the average.","Q \u2013 John Rider","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Gabe Hajde","Was going to \u2013 try to focusing on the consumer segment for a moment. I was curious if you guys have seen this type of destocking behavior before as it\u2019s more pronounced in any particular grade and if you have observed it in the past how long does it persists and what was the driving force behind the customers behavior, if you comment at all to that?","A \u2013 Pat Lindner","Yes, I don\u2019t have any \u2013 this is Pat. Thanks for the question. I don\u2019t really have any comparison directly head-to-head of the past. I think this is as we work in the market and we understand \u2013 trying to understand what\u2019s going on, we think this is probably a more of temporary event than a long-term one as current situation in, as said before we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that our demand will increase as we go throughout the year and of course, we\u2019re through our strategic outages now and so our ability to supply that and capture the volume is there in our backlog doing a good healthy position. So we\u2019re really looking forward and ready to capture that recovery as it happens.","Q \u2013 Gabe Hajde","Okay, thank you. And Ward I\u2019m curious, if I remember correctly the working capital build was up to $215 million for this year given sort of, I guess, a depressing for cost environment and then the price cut here in January might that be a little less or is that still the target?","Ward Dickson","Thank you for pointing that out. As a free cash flow guidance you\u2019re right as we walk through the free cash flow guidance there was a working capital build of over $200 million and I said, half of it was timing related because of the strong collections and the timing of payables that we had in fiscal 2019 and then half of it was temporary working capital build that was associated with the major outages and ramp up of both Tres Barras and the Florence paper machine. So, as we go through the year, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on reducing that working capital build and as we exit the year, we\u2019ll have that temporary build behind us. So, we have confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to exceed the $1 billion free cash flow target and the one of the elements for us is the continued focus on working capital reductions.","Q \u2013 Gabe Hajde","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Debbie Jones","I wanted to ask, if we sit here today and just kind of look at your corrugated footprint and all those things that you\u2019ve done and the offerings you have for your customers, would you expect that you will outpace industry growth over the next 12 to 18 months?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi Debbie, our plan is certainly to do that. We have invested significantly in a footprint we\u2019ve consolidated. We\u2019ve built a robust performance excellence platform, a machinery business and then enterprise business that supports growth and it supported in the last eight quarters above the market so my expectation for our business is to continue down that path.","Q \u2013 Debbie Jones","Do you think, it will be kind of in the same level that you\u2019ve already been appreciating the market?","Jeff Chalovich","It\u2019s hard to tell, I mean we set our goals of what we expect. It\u2019s hard to say what it will be above the market without knowing exactly what\u2019s going to happen to the market.","Q \u2013 Debbie Jones","Okay and can I just ask for a quick update on Grupo Gondi and just kind of your position and relationship down there in Mexico?","Steve Voorhees","Sure, Debbie. We own 32% and Gondi management team manages so we have couple seats on the board and Jim Porter and others with our company are highly involved with them on their capital projects and we work with our customers that have packaging needs in Mexico, we coordinate that closely with Grupo Gondi to extent the customers want to have us support that.","Q \u2013 Debbie Jones","Okay, great. That\u2019s perfect. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from Davidson. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Steve Chercover","Could you please discuss the strategy to raise your integration from 78% to 90%? Is it a blend of organic and acquisition and the prices for box plants or maybe particularly folding carton operations changed?","Jeff Chalovich","Steve, its Jeff. So the strategy for us is to grow organically as you pointed out and we stated we believe we continue to grow about 2% a year, we\u2019ll be opportunistically if we see bolt-on acquisitions in the future that makes sense for us. At a full run rate if you take Charleston and no economic downtime that\u2019s about 300 basis points that would add some integration and so we look to grow organically be opportunistic in acquisition and bolt-ons. I\u2019m not clear on the question on the consumer or the botched pricing. If you look at our channels, we\u2019ve said this that, the most profitable channel is running our businesses and integrate it through our box plants and so the integration will continue to aid, our margins.","A \u2013 Pat Lindner","Thanks Jeff. Maybe I\u2019ll comment a little bit on the consumer integration elements that you touched on. Just the way we look at this in SBS. We have about 40% of our volume that is serve some specialty market such as tobacco, commercial print and liquid packaging and in those situations, we\u2019re really specified down to the end user and sell the product on through a converter. So we really consider those significant amount of volume integrated and we\u2019ll continue to operate with that business model. I think when you look at the folding carton piece, there\u2019s a difference in substrates in terms of the integration level.","Today, we\u2019re about 70% integrative with CNK, CRB is at 60 and SBS that goes through folding cartons roughly 20. We certainly see opportunities in increased integration and we\u2019ll look at those in terms of where it makes sense and in the valuation of those opportunities in organically. But really what we\u2019re trying to do is, is grow organically through the plastics replacement opportunities that we have and selling across the enterprise as we discussed earlier. So we organic growth as a main way to get there, but at the same time we will continue to look for opportunities.","And I also want to close that with saying that it\u2019s very important that we continue to strategically supply our independent folding carton customers because they sometimes give us access to markets. For example regional markets that we will not have to our large folding carton operations so really all of that is strategic to us.","Q \u2013 Steve Chercover","Yes, thank you for expanding on that. My question on the consumer side was really, if my impression that it is, maybe 10 years behind where the integration levels are on corrugated and so that\u2019s really where those big opportunities. But it\u2019s also probably more impacted by the war on plastics so I thought the valuations might be getting skewed a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","One question just on export markets. Can you just talk about, if you\u2019ve seen much change in any particular region?","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Michael. In the quarter we saw early stability across the globe and that\u2019s in all our market China, Asia, Europe, Latin America, we had good produce seasons. In Europe and Latin America, so the export markets were steady and like I said earlier the pricing was flat quarter-over-quarter so stability across our all of our export markets.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","Okay, thanks and just one on box pricing. Can you talk at all about any trends you\u2019re seeing either toward the end of last year or early this year? Thanks.","Jeff Chalovich","So we talked about the flow through from the PPW movement and so we\u2019ve seen that in our business that moves down like it, it moves up and we\u2019ve commented on some of \u2013 I\u2019ve commented on what I saw in the market in the quarter based on recycled liner. You saw some of the medium, but more in kraft paper for our business. So to that extent, that\u2019s all I\u2019ll comment on.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Participant","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Paul Quinn","Just a question on consumer packaging. You guys have highlighted the increased demand for sustainable packaging. I\u2019m just wondering how big a component of that is to get to your medium-term target of 18% EBITDA margin and when is that target expected to happen?","A \u2013 Pat Lindner","Thanks Paul. This is Pat. So as you mentioned plastics replacement. I would say overall sustainable packaging is a very important part of our growth going forward. We right now have delivered $115 million run rate in applications that are in that space and we expect over the next few years to get to that $400 million run rate. So it\u2019s an important part of what we\u2019re trying to do to grow this business organically and we\u2019re confident that more and more opportunities are coming. For example China just banned the use of single use plastics here recently and there are other taxes or charges or surcharge associated with single use plastics. And so we\u2019re engaging deeply with our customers. We got great opportunities and we think it will be important part of our effort to get to our improved 18% margin that we mentioned earlier.","Q \u2013 Paul Quinn","All right. Thanks very much. Best of luck.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters.","James Armstrong","Thank you, operator.

My name is Christa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results Call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Christa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued a press release this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the right side of the application you're using to view this webcast.","With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer period.","I would like to point out that during the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discussed during the call. We described these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, and our 10-Q for the March -- for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.","Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.","So with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, James. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. WestRock delivered excellent financial results in the June quarter. Fundamentals are strong across all of our business. Our containerboard mills are operating at full capacity, and backlogs from the consumer mills are at or near-record levels.","Year-over-year performance improved significantly. Sales increased $442 million. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased by $163 million or 27%. We generated $783 million of adjusted operating cash flow. This increased 21% from last year. We remain on track to achieve our previously communicated full year goals for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating cash flow.","In the quarter, we achieved the $1 billion synergy and performance improvements goal that we set at the inception of WestRock just three years ago. When we set this goal, we developed specific targets and plans throughout the company, including for our operating locations and for functions such as procurement and logistics. Our collective focus on the $1 billion goal has been relentless. I'm proud of our team's efforts that enabled us to achieve this milestone one quarter early. And while we celebrate this milestone, we know we have many other opportunities to drive productivity across our company.","In addition, when we complete the KapStone acquisition, we'll set our sights on delivering the $200 million of cost synergies and performance improvements that we've previously outlined. We returned over $200 million to our stockholders in the quarter, $110 million through dividends and $101 million through share buybacks, paying less than $60 per share. This brings the total capital return to our stockholders since the creation of WestRock to approximately $2.1 billion.","As you no doubt saw last Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. real GDP increased 4.1% in the June quarter. This report highlighted that goods grew faster than services. Should this positive trend continue, I believe demand for sustainable paper-based packaging will follow and grow at favorable rates.","Sales for the quarter were $4.1 billion. Our consolidated adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 18.4% increased by 220 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.09. This was up 47% over last year. The results of the quarter reflect significant growth in our year-over-year financial performance and the compelling momentum that we've had in our business.","You may have seen KapStone's press release and 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30. They posted outstanding results for the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $138 million. This is 38% over the $100 million they earned last year. On a trailing 12 month basis, KapStone's adjusted EBITDA was $509 million, which is higher than the $500 million run rate we stated when we announced the planned acquisition in January.","I congratulate the KapStone team for their performance. As we grow and innovate with and for our customers, WestRock has a need for talented people with experience in our business who will help our company grow. I'm looking forward to the addition of the KapStone team to WestRock. The KapStone acquisition is subject to the approval of the KapStone stockholders at a special meeting scheduled for September 6. We continue to work through the regulatory approval processes in the United States, and we expect the acquisition to close by the end of the calendar year.","The WestRock Corrugated Packaging team delivered outstanding results in the quarter. Adjusted segment EBITDA was up 29% to $485 million. Our North American corrugated adjusted segment EBITDA margin of 23% was 420 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. I congratulate the Corrugated Packaging team on their remarkable execution and the leadership they have throughout the organization. Since the acquisition of Smurfit-Stone, we've increased our North American corrugated margins by more than 1,000 basis points. Our margins are now comparable to our public company competitors.","We're maintaining our focus on margin improvement through our productivity programs, optimizing our supply chain and investing in strategic projects that reduce our cost. A great example of this type of investment is our Florence paper machine upgrade, which we believe will add between 60 and 70 basis points of margin to our North American Corrugated Packaging segment. The corrugated industry remains attractive and growing, and we've outgrown the market for the last 15 months. We're seeing strong demand across the majority of our corrugated end markets. WestRock's North American box shipments increased 4.1% on a per day basis and 5.7% on an absolute basis as compared to last year. This volume increase was driven by the contributions of our recent acquisitions as well as strong demand in the e-commerce and retail markets.","Our integration level for the quarter increased from 72% to 76% year-over-year. Our system is tight due to strong demand across the majority of our end markets. Our inventories are below where we would like them to be, and this has caused some inefficiencies in our network. We're working with our customers to ensure that they have supply when they need it, and many of them are entering into long-term contracts to secure their long-term supply. Sales of containerboard to domestic independent converters remain very important to WestRock. During the quarter, we shipped 292,000 tons to independent converters. In the past 12 months, we've shipped more than 1.1 million tons of containerboard to this market. We shipped 208,000 tons to export markets. This was a decline of 53,000 tons year-over-year and 65,000 tons sequentially. Our Brazil team delivered exceptional results during the quarter with record adjusted segment EBITDA margins of 28.3%. This was up 150 basis points sequentially and 320 basis points over the prior year. Construction at our new Porto Feliz box plant is under way, and we expect this plant to start up in the second half of fiscal '19.","Our Consumer Packaging team increased volumes by an impressive 7% year-over-year, with approximately half of this increase from organic growth and the other half from acquisitions, through strength in most of the consumer end markets, including health and beauty, food packaging, food service, liquid packaging and beverage. Volumes in our core food packaging business have increased over the last 3 quarters in a row. This was a significant reversal from the flat to down volumes in the center of the story that we've been seeing. We believe this signals a pickup in this market and demonstrates the success that we're having with our customers. Our paperboard backlogs improved through the quarter and are currently between 5 and 6 weeks for SBS and CNK. At 6 weeks, CRB backlogs are some of the longest we've ever seen. Pulp & Paper Week published price increases in the March and April issues across each of our consumer grades, and we're implementing these increases across our business under contract. We're also implementing the CRB and URB price increases published by PPW in June and July.","We're winning new business in multiple market -- in multiple growing end markets, including craft beer and health care. Many of these customers are entering into multiple-year contracts as they seek to lock in long-term supply with WestRock. And they're buying products across our broad portfolio, securing contracts for cartons, partitions, labels, leaflets and machinery.","Adjusted segment EBITDA in the quarter was $272 million, up 18% year-over-year. Looking at the year-over-year bridge, we generated strong growth in volume and price. Lower recovered fiber costs help mitigate the impact of cost inflation, but not to the same degree as in the corrugated segment. Our consumer mills used 1 million tons of recycled fiber a year, significantly less than the 4 million tons consumed by our corrugated mills. Our $37 million in productivity resulted from the benefits of our capital investments, procurement savings, the internalization of MPS paperboard volume and the results delivered by our Six Sigma and performance excellence teams. Our $37 million in productivity was an important contributor to our results in the quarter by fully offsetting increases in inflation of materials, energy and freight and offsetting the majority of our wage inflation.","That concludes my comments in the quarter. I'll now turn it over to Ward.","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. We had a very successful quarter in Land and Development, closing on several large land sales, including Cabin Bluff. In the past week, we also closed on the sale of Summers Corner, the last of the large residential development projects in the portfolio. We expect to be substantially complete with the monetization of the Land and Development portfolio by the end of the calendar year 2018. As Steve referenced, in the June quarter, we accomplished our goal of $1 billion of synergies and performance improvements. Even though we achieved this important goal, we will continue to seek performance and productivity improvements that more than offset normal inflation. Our culture is one of continuous improvement, innovation and execution, all key to driving strong future financial results.","Turning to Slide 10, we detail the key assumptions included in our fiscal fourth quarter financial guidance. We expect sequential adjusted earnings per diluted share to be higher than the $1.09 achieved in the third quarter. First, we expect adjusted segment EBITDA to increase by $68 million to $83 million sequentially as a result of the flow-through of previously announced price increases, seasonally higher volumes, favorable mix and continued productivity gains. Second, we expect maintenance downtime to decrease by 133,000 tons sequentially across our mill system. Lower maintenance downtime and other items will have an estimated $38 million cost benefit quarter-over-quarter.","Third, input costs are expected to be $10 million to $15 million higher than the third quarter. Recycled fiber costs have declined, and we now expect them to stay at lower levels in the near term. Based on our regional consumption mix, our average index price paid for recycled fiber in the third fiscal quarter was $78 per ton, which matches the July index price. For the quarter, we are forecasting that recycled fiber prices will decline slightly from July's levels. However, noting the volatility we've seen this year, predicting recycled fiber cost remains difficult. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS will be unfavorably impacted by the 24.5% tax rate and higher depreciation and amortization.","Turning to Slide 11. We are reaffirming our full year fiscal 2018 adjusted operating cash flow guidance of $2.45 billion as well as our guidance of more than $2.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA. We are fine-tuning our revenue guidance and now expect to see full year revenues of $16.3 billion. We expect that we will invest over $1 billion in total capital expenditures in the fiscal 2018. The $1 billion includes $150 million that we expect to invest in strategic capital projects, including the Florence paper machine, the Brazil box plant and the curtain coder project at our Mahrt mill. We are positioned to deliver record financial results for the full year and strong growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating cash flow.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. I'd like to talk for a moment about our broad portfolio of differentiated paper and packaging solutions. We're making excellent progress integrating the sale of products from this portfolio. This is providing the opportunity for us to grow our sales with customers that value our solutions and optimize our business across our system. To provide some perspective on this topic, we serve more than 100 customers who bought at least $1 million from each segment over the past 12 months. Our average sales to the top 100 of these customers are about $50 million per year and account for $5 billion of WestRock's annual sales. Sales to this group in the aggregate are evenly split between our Corrugated and Consumer segments.","Our portfolio and capabilities provide us the opportunity to work with these and many other customers in ways that no other company can replicate. We have the ability to integrate our broad portfolio into many of our customers' most important use cases. I'll provide you a few examples. Let's start with cereal. We can provide both the cereal carton and the corrugated box used to ship the cartons full of cereal. We can design both the carton and the box together in tandem to optimize the overall performance and the use of fiber. In many cases, we're integrating the carton and the box to produce a retail-ready package that goes directly on to the store shelf. This saves stocking cost for the retailer, provide shoppers with the ability to easily identify and purchase their favorite products.","We supply beverage customers with the cartons, machinery, corrugated boxes and merchandising displays, which combine to provide a powerful combination for these customers to promote their products. We're pairing folding cartons with our retail displays to help health and beauty companies promote and deliver their products directly to consumers. With our pharmaceutical customers, we can integrate our folding carton, leaflets and inserts into an integrated packaging solution that ensures that rigorous brand, compliance and safety requirements are successfully met.","Box on Demand is an important addition to our machinery portfolio, and this solution is gaining interest from many of our customers. ","Across our corrugated and beverage machine platform, we installed more than 50 machines in the quarter, and this brings our total company machine placements to over 3,400. This is a number we expect to continue to grow.","So our success is coming from more than simply cross-selling across our differentiated portfolio. Our combination of consumer and corrugated packaging uniquely positions us to solve the critical challenges our customers are facing. Whether we're helping our customers grow their sales, lower their total cost, minimize their risk or improve their sustainability, we're providing the paper packaging and machinery solutions that deliver value. I'm proud of the way our teams are working together to help meet our customers' most critical challenges, and in the process, improve our business.","WestRock's vision is to be the premier partner and unrivaled provider of winning solutions for our customers. We're driving margin growth across WestRock through strong operating execution and solid business fundamentals. We expect that our fiscal 2018 consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins will increase by more than 250 basis points.","Our team is committed to working together to help our customers achieve their goals using our portfolio of differentiated paper and packaging solutions. WestRock's broad offerings across our Consumer and Corrugated segments provide unique value for customers, enabling them to have one partner for their packaging needs that will help them win in the marketplace. Through our strong execution and capital allocation, we'll continue to improve margins and grow our cash flow and use the strong cash flow to reinvest in our business and make acquisitions that support our strategy. We'll return capital to stockholders by increasing our dividend over time and opportunistically repurchasing shares within our target leverage ratio. This is a formula that provides significant opportunities for WestRock employees, customers and investors over the short and long term.","That concludes my prepared remarks. James, we are ready for Q&A.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience to give everybody a chance to ask a question, please limit your questions to one with a follow-up as needed. We will get to as many as time allows. Christa, can we take our first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, your first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","George Staphos","Steve, also, congratulations on the recent award. I guess, the first question I had is on consumer. And just trying to see whether the performance in the segment was in line, perhaps a little worse, perhaps a little better with your forecast, and whether any of the outage expense that you called out was related to consumer or corrugated. And then I had a follow-on.","Ward Dickson","George, this is Ward, and I'll start, and I'll let Bob fill in. The consumer business was performed to our expectations that we embedded in the guidance leading into the quarter. And the outage, the excess outage cost that we highlighted was related to the outages that we had in our corrugated system.","George Staphos","So largely Florence then, Ward?","Jeff Chalovich","George, it's Jeff. No, it wasn't Florence. This was our largest maintenance outage quarter, so we had 125,000 tons of downtime. Nine of our mills had outages, eight of them went very well, 1 didn't go as well. And we had some excess costs in labor, maintenance, fiber and other costs. So that was the outage.","George Staphos","And then the other question I had, as you think about Box on Demand and the machine installations that you're getting, it's, I guess, encouraging to see the volume growth. I know it's a relatively new initiative, but is there any kind of audit so far that you could relay in terms of how sticky these sales are? Are you seeing any turnover in terms of contracts where there's been a machine installation? What kind of relative return do you get on this sort of sale versus your existing business? And what are the risks that you have to keep on top of machinery trends to keep this initiative going?","Jeff Chalovich","That was a lot in one there, George, so let me break them down.","George Staphos","Sorry about that.","Jeff Chalovich","So -- that's okay. Starting out, so they are performing to our expectations. We're really getting synergies between combining our automated packaging systems group with Box on Demand. So our EPS sales leads are already selling Box on Demand. We haven't seen any turnover in the contracts that we have. So the business is sticky. And just like our APS contractual business, it's typically a 5-year deal, and there's a high repeat rate with that business. Like most of our differentiated product, there is better margins associated with that business. If you take a plain brown box versus our differentiated products, it carries higher margins typically. And then like all the machine business and differentiation, you have to have innovation in the pipeline to continue to differentiate in the marketplace, so we have constant projects. Across our machine platforms, both in beverage and in corrugated, we're always looking for the next innovation and working with our customers to innovate and really meet their demands. It's critical that we don't do that in a vacuum, but it's solving specific problems for our customers. And so that's what we continue to do across our machine platform. I think I -- okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Maguire","I was hoping you could just comment on the pace of the box price increase maybe relative to what you saw with the increase last year. And maybe you can give some data, if possible, on how much of it you realized in the third quarter, maybe the exit rate and then kind of how much you'd expect to get in the fourth quarter?","Jeff Chalovich","Consistent with what we said on the last 2, based on our contractual business, this latest published March increase, we will recover in 2 quarters based on our contractual flow-through. So we'll leave the September quarter at a $50 run rate. Through this, the June quarter, we left over at 60%, so we had already been in the 60% -- over 60% run rate after this last quarter. And it's typical there's not a lot of difference. There's some difference in the way the contracts fall, that it happen to be before the quarter, so a little earlier, but it still basically ends in the same quarter, same run rate.","Brian Maguire","Just wanted to switch gears a little bit. The Newberg mill you've got in Oregon that has been in the news a little bit lately, I think we've seen a little bit of an increase in interest from Chinese buyers in U.S. assets. We've also seen some commentary around recycled pulp potentially being a solution to China's ban on mixed paper. I was just wondering if you're reevaluating opportunities there, if you would consider restarting that mill yourself to maybe make some recycled pulp or as a partnership with somebody else, given it looks like there's a -- could be a decent export market for product coming out of that mill.","Steve Voorhees","Brian, this is Steve. I think we kind of entered into a contract to sell the site in January, and we're unable to close because the buyer couldn't obtain financing. So we're now assessing the best use of the Newberg facility. It's going to take some time for us to determine the next steps, and we don't have an identified time frame to make that decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.","Ashish Gupta","This is Ashish Gupta for Mark. First question was, just wanted to go into the strength in kraft paper markets, just more or less in reference to your comments about the strength of KapStone. Just wondering if you can provide some color on what's driving that.","Jeff Chalovich ","Ashish, it's Jeff. So our business in kraft paper, there's multiple use in our world, I can't speak for KapStone. So ours is food service, strength in food service packaging business. There's also strength in fillers. So the ecommerce movement for some of the bag and kraft fillers has been driving some of that. So that business is robust for us, and we look forward to acquiring KapStone and being more competitive and expanding our scope across other markets.","Ashish Gupta","Yes, it seems like you guys timed that well. I just wanted to follow up on some of the comments in the prepared remarks. I think this is the first time I've heard you guys speak to long-term contracts with your customers. Just wanted to explore how you're thinking about that, what the pricing mechanism works -- how the pricing mechanism would work in the contracts. Just wanted to understand more about that.","Jeff Chalovich ","Okay. It's Jeff again. So I'll speak to what we've seen. So in containerboard and box, there's a couple of different ones. So in our long-term views of containerboard contracts, we're getting some historically longer contracts that would go over our 2 or 3 years. There are varying mechanisms to move the pricing, and I won't get into that specifically, but there's varying methods, and that's a negotiation with our individual customers. But on our customers' standpoint, it gives them secured supply. It gives us a secure look. So as we look at investing capital for customers and growing and be more competitive in the marketplace, it's good for them and it's good for us. And we're seeing that across both our containerboard space and our corrugated packaging space.","Ashish Gupta","Oh, sorry, go ahead.","Bob Feeser","I would just say ditto in the consumer space as well. We're having discussions with the customers about longer-term contracts. And again, I won't get into the mechanisms, but we have a variety of price mechanisms embedded in our contracts with our customers.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde","Steve, I wondered if you could just give us a little more color on sort of progress with MPS, what kind of volumes you're seeing in that business, your ability to kind of grow those kind of specialty packaging products.","Steve Voorhees","MPS has performed, I think, very well according to the expectations that we had going in. I think the acquisition is working out pretty much as we planned. I think it has given us exposure to higher-grade and higher-quality markets. And particularly in health care, I think that's been -- particularly health care in Europe, it's been growing to the point where we're really pushing the constraints of capacity. And so the issue that MPS has had, had been more trying to deal with the volume and the great growth that they've had in their business since the acquisition.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And just as a follow-on, Steve. I wondered, could you talk going forward whether you think the paperboard packaging business is going to kind of shift from being kind of what's traditionally been a regional business to being more of a global business? I think if you went back 30 or 40 years ago, Smurfit talked a lot about this, but I think they were still -- essentially, it was kind of regional businesses for them.","Steve Voorhees","I think it is, and I think it's more of an evolution rather than a revolution. And I think where we see it, and we've seen it in the MPS market and MPS customers, and I'll explain it in a second. But I think we're cognizant of that as we're going through the acquisition. I think for those customers that have a global buy, so I think that's one condition. And then the second condition is they have to have a strong feeling for consistent quality of their packaging around the globe. Those type of customers, there is a opportunity to supply packaging on a global basis to those customers. Let's say, if somebody is regional, then that won't be the case. If somebody is global and isn't -- has different brands or isn't concerned about the quality, it's not the case. But the global customers, they care about quality. It certainly is the opportunity, and we see it today with those customers that we're able to serve those customers around the world and have consistent print quality for those customers.","Bob Feeser","Mark, this is Bob. If I could just follow up on that. So where that really plays out is in the health care markets and in the beverage markets. And as you might imagine, with pharmaceutical companies, there's more of a focus on having a consistent quality packaging system around the world. So those are the end end markets, in particular, that really lend themselves to more broad-based international coverage.","Mark Wilde","Okay, that's helpful. Listen, good luck in the fourth quarter, guys.","Steve Voorhees","Okay, Mark, and thanks for the hooray in your note this morning.","Mark Wilde","That brings a long time for that gift that belongs to you.","Steve Voorhees","We have been, too, but the corrugated team has just done an amazing job.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","I just wanted to clarify, if I could, when you were discussing the multiyear contracts that you're putting in place. And clearly, that would be on the supply side. So are there also differences, particularly in the corrugated, on the way the pricing mechanisms might work relative to where they have historically? And might that lead to -- or would that potentially reduce volatility as you see it?","Jeff Chalovich","Mark, it's Jeff. As I commented earlier, we have multiple mechanisms that trigger movement in the contracts. It's important to remember that pricing is set between buyers and sellers. So we're in the market, it's a competitive market, it always has and it always will be. So we negotiate the price and agree on the price.","And then there's multiple ways to trigger movements in the contracts, and so that varies by customer and by accounts. And so the volatility is more market-related, and that could be cost-related or supply\/demand inventories, there's volatility across all of the different types. It's important that we just have consensus with our customers, the way to best move that helps them and helps us, and that we have agreement. It's just a baseline for what triggers the movement. And then like I said, there's no one methodology across our systems in containerboard and boxes. And so it's a one-on-one negotiation with our customers how we move their prices.","Mark Weintraub","Understood. But we shouldn't read into it that conceptually, you're trying to engage in ways to create a model which might have less volatility over time in the margin, or are you?","Jeff Chalovich","No, I wouldn't categorize that, that way. I think what we want is long-term contracts that our customers benefit from, that we benefit from so they can plan supply and we can plan the demand. And we also invest capital based on what our customers are doing in the future and to help them solve problems. So that just gives us a better view and less volatility in how we invest capital, how we run our plants and how they run their operations.","Mark Weintraub","And just Smurfit Kappa, on their call yesterday, had suggested that OCC had actually started to go up in the U.S., as I understood it. It's kind of surprising a little bit. Are you seeing that as well? And any thoughts on the way supermarkets more generally given all the different things going on?","Jeff Chalovich","No. I think what we've stated is we see it flattish right now. The restrictions on -- that have been put in place in June when self-inspections are still in, as well as the CCIC, the China Certification and Inspection Group, is still doing all the inspections. And so that is causing a slowdown, almost a stop of OCC going to China. And as you've seen, the Chinese are looking for fiber in other places, and they may ban imports altogether. So in the short term, we see it flat; in the long term, who knows? It depends what China does. They can get it through containerboard. They can get it through pulp. They can get it through recycled fiber. We're well-positioned to supply. And also, the balance of our system with recycle and virgins, we're well-positioned to perform well regardless of what happens in the OCC market.","Ward Dickson","And Mark, this is Ward. To clarify on our guidance, the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 is between $2 and $3.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Adam Josephson","Ward, one question on CapEx for next year, just based on what you've already talked about. I know you've talked about maintenance of about 850 million. I believe you said Mahrt and Brazil would add about 100 million next year. And then Florence, I'm thinking Florence will add about 300 million just based on the total investment of 400 million that you've talked about and that most of that would be concentrated in fiscal '19. Do any of those pieces sound particularly off to you?","Ward Dickson","No. The $850 million baseline, plus the roughly $150 million for the remaining strategic projects, and I think the view on Florence is between $250 million to $300 million next year.","Adam Josephson","And just an update on July shipments. I know you're up 4.1% in the June quarter. Can you talk at all about what you saw in July, just given that we're through the month already?","Jeff Chalovich","Yes. Before the month closed, Adam, we were up 6.5% aggregate. Remember, there's 2 more shipping days, but we're up 6.5%.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","It's interesting, we've heard pretty much from the top 8 players, except for the one private one -- one of the private ones in terms of what their needs are going to be to supply growth going forward. And I believe you all have suggested, when you announced Florence, that you didn't feel the need on the capacity front to add and that, instead, if you need more board, you would just pull it in from export. And just recognizing that you've been doing that, is that still the strategy as we look out?","Jeff Chalovich","Well, remember, we have more capacity that we're looking to acquire with the KapStone acquisition. So that gives us some opportunity to expand in markets that we don't currently serve and to further expand with the customers that we do currently serve. So we're going to have opportunities to grow with the capacity that's in KapStone. I've also mentioned on other calls that besides pulling from export, we could invest to add capacity in our current mill system. We haven't had to do that. And with the KapStone acquisition, I don't see us having to do that in the short term. But demand remains strong. There is a need for capacity based on demand for box. And as you said, most of the folks adding it have been integrated and have downstream customers. So we are well-positioned in our system and with the acquisition of KapStone to expand.","Chip Dillon","And I think on the last -- just one quick follow-up. You had mentioned that in July, your shipments were up, and maybe I misheard you, 6%, but there were 2 more days, which would -- I just want to make sure I didn't hear this wrong, given that each day is 5%, that would suggest that per day was down considerably. Did I misunderstand that?","Jeff Chalovich","No, you heard right. I mean, we'll be down 3.5% per day, but there's no change in our backlogs, no change in our demand profile. July -- 4th of July is in the middle of the month, but it's still strong backlogs, nothing functionally changed in our demand. It's still very strong, and we're running full-out box plants and mills.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Debbie Jones","First, congratulations on hitting the $1 billion target early. You mentioned some opportunities going forward to improve performance. I know there's one you highlighted KapStone. Can you give us a sense of what else you're optimistic about or think there's an opportunity for going forward?","Ward Dickson","We laid out the margin improvement plans in our Investor Day presentations for both Corrugated and Consumer. So in the Corrugated business, it didn't -- we did have the benefits related to the strategic investments to improve our cost position. And in the Consumer side of the business , we talked about the -- some of the investments that we're making, increasing vertical integration, achieving the synergies from the MPS opportunities. We are driven across this organization to make sure that we drive productivity, both in the functions and in the plants that offsets the normal rate of inflation so that we have the ability to sustain and improve margins.","Deborah Jones","Okay. And I just wanted to turn to consumer. I thought your volumes were pretty impressive. I'm trying to get a sense of how sustainable that is and if this is a shift from other substrates or business wins based on some of the revenue synergies that you've highlighted.","Bob Feeser","Yes, Debbie, this is Bob. I think when you think about consumer, I think it's important to recognize that we're not just about the center of the grocery store, that over 50% of our mix is outside of this. And just as a reminder, MPS, that acquisition was important in terms of really shifting our participation in faster-growth health and beauty. And as we looked at the quarter, health care, our business was quite strong, as Steve referenced, both in North America and in the U.S. -- and in Europe. And we're also seeing strong participation in food service as well, and that being fueled by just underlying good fundamentals, but also the shift from foam and plastics to paper. And then we also highlighted the retail food area, so three quarters in a row where we've seen growth in that area, which was good to see. And we're seeing some return to growth in frozen food and some dry food and snack areas. We're also winning new business with smaller brands. So the center of the store decline appears to be stable, and we're starting to see some demand recoveries with the overall economy. And then in beverage, we have spots where we're seeing good growth, whether it's craft brew and sparkling water area. But in North America and in Latin America, we really saw very good growth. So we feel good about the outlook. And again, the overall enterprise approach that we have with our customers is really giving us more opportunities and more touch points across our customers to grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson.","Steve Chercover","My question was about the KapStone integration thing. I just wanted to ask, are you able to set up a joint data room at this point so the preparation is collaborative? Or are you compelled to operate as if you're still full-blown competitors?","Steve Voorhees","We're compelled to operate as we're full-blown competitors.","Steve Chercover","So what type of preparation can you do, I mean, you can't share a list and whatnot?","Steve Voorhees","Just not as much as we would like to do. So we're very interested in going through the regulatory process so we can get the deal completed. We have had introductory meetings, but I think, as you had mentioned, there's a limit to how much you can do. So we're ready to move forward with the acquisition.","Steve Chercover","Okay. And then, I guess, not a follow-up, but it's a great accomplishment for you guys to close the gap between yourselves and your more virgin containerboard competitors. And I'm sure that's mainly operational, but OCC is helpful since you're a bit less virgin. Can you sustain it if OCC goes back up? Is there still more to come operationally?","Jeff Chalovich ","Steve, it's Jeff. I think we laid out clearly in our Investor Day, we had another 200 basis points before the move of OCC repricing, and that really came from the strategic capital investments, footprint optimization, supply chain optimization, differentiation, the sales margin growth. So we do have more, and we will continue on the track of improvements. And the business has been operating well and will continue to operate well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Jeff, just a follow-up on the box shipments for a minute because they did slow down a little bit from the prior quarters, 6.8% down to 4.1%, and you said July slowed, but then you also said, I think, that the order book was relatively strong. Is there anything that you're seeing that's causing the near-term slowdown in volume growth on a year-over-year basis?","Jeff Chalovich","Scott, so I think it's instructive, too. On the 4.1%, if you look at the FBA comparison, when you compare FBA, our shipments are actually up over 6% on a per day and 8% in the FBA comparison. So 4.1% is everything and includes sheets, Canada. But if you do just the FBA comparison, our quarter was over 6% per day and 8% overall. So that's note number one. Note number two is, no. And last July, if you look at where we were, we were up 12%. So the business continues to run full. There's no difference in any of our backlogs. July is typically a slower month. We have the 4th of July. You have customers who took downtime for maintenance. They have vacations or -- a couple of our customers have a week or two off. So there's nothing structurally in the business that slowed down, in our volume or our backlogs, again, we're running full out everywhere.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. So you -- it sounds like maybe you're just saying more of a comparison issue than an underlying market issue. Is it fair?","Jeff Chalovich","I think that's fair. Yes.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And then, Steve, just moving to KapStone, back to KapStone for a second. Originally, you had said September quarter close, and I think you said at the beginning of December, and now you're saying by the end of 2018. Is there anything there around the regulatory hurdle that's further pushing this back? Or anything that you think is getting in the way of closing the KapStone deal?","Steve Voorhees","No, there's really nothing new. I think when we announced the acquisition, we thought there was some probability of a second request or receive a second request. I think we're just working through that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","In corrugated, you indicated inventories are below where you'd like them to be, and that led to some inefficiency in your system. I'm just wondering, was there a financial impact from that in the quarter that you could quantify? And then what steps are you taking to mitigate that this quarter in terms of managing inventories and supply chain?","Jeff Chalovich","Anthony, it's Jeff. So the impact in the quarter is small. It's really from shipping roll stock between plants or some upgrades, some side terms of -- it's $1 million or $2 million small in the sense of better to make the shipments and take the upgrades and keep customers happy. So this is -- this quarter, we have no maintenance downtime, so we're confident we'll be able to resupply the plants, get our inventories in lines and have some less of the upset, but there's not really a material effect on the margins.","Anthony Pettinari","And then just following up on George's question. Consumer margins have been lower year-over-year, I think, for five quarters. From a big-picture perspective, is that just a catch-up of price cost with boxboard price increases having longer lags than corrugated? Or is that, I don't know, impact of MPS? Or is there something else that's driving that? And then in the current quarter, would you expect year-over-year margin improvement or any thoughts on kind of margin improvement moving forward?","Ward Dickson","Yes. So I'll start, this is Ward, and I'll have Bob tag on. So remember when you look at the consumer business, it's not getting the benefit of the deflation from OCC and has had to experience the elevated impact of higher freight and higher chemicals costs. The flow-through, the previously published price increases, as Bob highlighted earlier, is starting to contribute to the P&L, especially as we exit the fiscal year. Bob, do you want to add anything to that?","Bob Feeser","Yes. I think, as expected, the margins improved in the third quarter and I think are more in line with historical levels. We saw about 120 basis point improvement over the quarter. And as we go into the fourth quarter, we would expect to see further improvement in margins. Demand is good, more heading into our seasonally strong quarter. We had a good productivity quarter in the third quarter, and we're expecting to have good productivity in the fourth quarter as well. And that I think, as Ward talked about, just as a reminder, the consumer margins have definitely been impacted by the significantly higher freight and chemical costs that weren't fully offset by the lower OCC cost.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Your line is now open.","Gail Glazerman","Going back to consumer demand, you talked about the shift away from foam. I'm wondering, are you starting to hear from customers in other areas where they're interested in replacing plastic with paper-based alternatives?","Bob Feeser","Gail, it's Bob. Yes, as you know, this has really become a top-of-mind issue with consumers, retailers, CPGs and regulators. So we're talking to a number of customers about either reducing plastic packaging or eliminating it in total. And really, for us, it's across four areas. In food service, which is really ground zero for the shift from plastic and film to paper, there, we're offering high-quality paperboard for hot drink and cold drink cups. We've got a variety of packages for takeout containers, including E-flute corrugated clamshells to replace foam, and then also paperboard containers to replace aluminum sandwich wraps, and as Jeff talked about, kraft paper to replace plastic bags.","Then in beverage, we're seeing more of a renewed interest in shifting from printed shell multipacks to paperboard. And there, we have a variety of solutions, including machinery to help customers, including CanCollar, which replaces the plastic ring for multipacks. And then in food, our focus there has really been on providing materials that are more recyclable. And we're seeing good interest in our barrier paperboard solution that we call EnShield. This provides a grease and oil and moisture barrier without extruding the plastic in food and ice cream applications, and there's a lot of interest in that. And finally, in e-commerce, a big focus, and I think Jeff touched on this, is eliminating void fill in packaging. And we have solutions like our Meta e as well as Box on Demand that also help reduce overall void fill in e-commerce.","Gail Glazerman","And then just broadly speaking, probably more on the corrugated side. Are you hearing any concerns from customers about the mounting trade pressure going on? There's been some talk of protein stacking up in freezers. Are you starting to hear that as a concern about this that might impact demand over the next few quarters?","Jeff Chalovich","So we're hearing from customers if they're watching it closely. We haven't had a large effect that we've seen yet in actuality, but everybody is aware of it. They're watching their business, and they'll react accordingly when they see actually what happens.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Quickly, the revenue refinement, the guidance refinement for this year, what's behind that? Is that a little bit of FX? Is that the truckers' strike in Brazil? By the way, very good performance in Brazil considering that. And then the other question I had, just in terms of capital allocation. You clearly outlined what you're doing and consistent on what you said in the past. But given the way the peers' stocks and the way your stock has performed in the last few months, has return to value may be even further improved in terms of its ranking on the priority list?","Ward Dickson","I'll take both of them. The revenue guidance really just reflects our performance through Q3 and then the pinpoint forecast that we had for Q4, so it's really nothing more than that. Shifting to capital allocation, as you know, with the completion -- successful completion of the KapStone acquisition will be just over 3x, above our leverage target of 2.25x to 2.5x. So clearly, we will be focused in FY '19 on paying down debt and returning back inside our leverage target. We did buy back stock this quarter, and we have -- we do have some flexibility to do that going forward. But again, our priority will be focused on debt repayment.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly","Since you announced the KapStone deal, I feel like there's been a fair amount of movement, whether it's OCC, kraft and export pricing as well as the containerboard price increase and a lot more to be excited about, I guess, I would say. I just wanted to -- wondering if you could kind of maybe walk through some of those things that -- since you've had a few months, I know you're not under the hood yet, but just broader market environment, what you're excited about.","Jeff Chalovich","So we look at the business over the long term. And the containerboard packaging, paper packaging biz is exciting in general. We think it's a great business. And so when we did the acquisition, we believe that would make us more competitive, would serve broader markets and markets that we weren't currently in and give us a chance to serve current customers in broader markets and enhance our offerings to them. And so these market conditions make that as appealing or more, but we were bullish on it when we announced it, and we're pleased that we're moving forward and can't wait to get it done, actually.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, to Matt Tractenberg. Sir, you may begin.","Matthew Tractenberg","Thank you, Dexter. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. My name is Matt Tractenberg. I'm WestRock's Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm joined this morning by Steve Voorhees, WestRock's Chief Executive Officer; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of Business Development & Latin America; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment.","During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015.","Additionally, we will be referencing adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We've provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.","So, with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.","Steven Voorhees","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. September marked the end of our first fiscal year at WestRock. We've had an exciting and productive year. We've made considerable progress in building WestRock into what we are today. We're a $14 billion paper and packaging company. We hold leading positions across a broad set of markets. We're providing our customers with tailor-made solutions that help them win in their markets.","We're executing our strategic plan and delivering excellent results. After only five quarters, we're already halfway toward our $1 billion three-year synergy and performance improvement target. Over the same five quarters, we've delivered $444 million in productivity improvements. We manage our business to sustain and grow our cash flows over the long-term.","During fiscal 2016, we delivered over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. We returned $716 million to stockholders through $381 million in dividends and $335 million in share repurchases. To-date, we've bought back 13.5 million shares or 5% of WestRock's outstanding shares. We improved our business by investing $588 million in two acquisitions and one joint venture. Our balance sheet is in great shape with a leverage ratio of 2.33 times.","On Friday, we announced a $0.10 per share increase to our annual dividend. The dividend increase underscores our confidence in our long-term cash flows. We have ample capacity to reinvest in our existing facilities. We have the flexibility to make acquisitions that improve our business and generate attractive returns. We will continue to purchase WestRock shares and expect to hold leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 times to 2.5 times.","Sales for the quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $589 million for a margin of 16.3%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.71. Productivity initiatives contributed $89 million to our income during the quarter. We transferred $2.5 billion of pension assets and liabilities to a third-party.","This transaction significantly de-risked our U.S. qualified pension plan. For the full year, sales were $14 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 billion for a margin of 16%. We achieved our productivity and cash flow objectives in fiscal 2016 and we've set the stage for a very successful 2017.","The Corrugated Packaging team delivered solid results in the quarter, including North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.2%. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $31 million from the prior year and was flat sequentially. As we said would happen on last quarter's call, the Pulp & Paper Week price reduction from earlier this year continues to flow through this quarter. This is true for both our box and domestic containerboard businesses.","We reduced inventory by 143,000 tons from a year ago and we reduced inventories 16,000 tons sequentially. We took 32,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the quarter. Most of this downtime was at our Stevenson mill, where we completed our capital project to convert to a new pulping process. This scheduled outage of the Stevenson mill reduced income by $10 million.","We've communicated a $50 per ton price increase to our customers for domestic containerboard and corrugated packaging. Export pricing has improved in our largest markets, including Latin America, where pricing was up $8 per ton sequentially. Our system has been and continues to be tied with good demand, low inventories and high operating rates.","Within our box business, backlogs have strengthened and our current pipeline of new business remains strong. Our differentiated strategy is earning us new business. In October, our box volumes were up 1.6% over last year on a daily basis.","Turning to Hurricane Matthew, I'm pleased to report that our employees came through Hurricane Matthew with no injuries. We have had several employees and their families with damage to their homes. And some of these employees are receiving support from the WestRock Employee Relief Fund. The impact of Hurricane Matthew on our business has reduced production by 35,000 tons.","We've reduced shipments to export markets to help meet our improving demand, as well as address the lower production due to Hurricane Matthew.","Grupo Gondi sales in the quarter were $180 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. We shipped 55,000 tons of containerboard to the Grupo Gondi joint venture. And we expect shipments to increase going forward, as Gondi grows its business. Lastly, Gondi completed the acquisition of Aluprint, a leading manufacturer of folding cartons in Mexico.","This acquisition adds additional capabilities for Gondi to serve customers in the growing Mexican packaging market. In Brazil, our team performed exceptionally well despite continued regional economic challenges. Box shipments per day were up by approximately 9% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. EBITDA margins were 26.4%.","Jim Porter is working with the team in Brazil. And I expect that they will create attractive investment opportunities for WestRock over the next year. Jim continues to advise us on the North American containerboard business, as Jeff Chalovich has assumed the responsibility of leading this business for WestRock.","Jeff brings over 25 years of industry experience to WestRock. He joined RockTenn in 2008 when we acquired Southern Container. He's been leading our $5 billion box business for the past four years. Over the same period, we've improved our North American Corrugated Packaging EBITDA margins from 13% to 18%. Jeff's leadership has driven much of this improvement and we have more runway to increase margins.","I'm looking forward to supporting our entire Corrugated Packaging team to deliver even better results through the execution of our differentiated strategy. Consumer Packaging delivered improved earnings and margins in the quarter. Net sales were $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $268 million. We delivered $42 million in productivity improvements. This drove our 90-basis-point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins.","Folding carton revenue grew by 10% year-over-year driven by the Cenveo Packaging acquisition and organic growth of 2% in our core North American business. We're making good progress on productivity initiatives across our converting businesses. Pricing and mix were favorable, primarily due to lower pulp volumes. This was partially offset by the flow through of previously published index reductions for SBS and CRB.","Our SBS backlogs have strengthened and are currently at five weeks. We produced less pulp at our SBS mills in the quarter. This was a result of improved paper board demand and planned maintenance outages of the Covington and Demopolis mills. We're seeing limited penetration from European and Asian board suppliers that's been targeting the U.S. market.","Finally, sequentially, both our CRB and CNK backlog have increased and both are approximately three weeks. Bob Feeser leads our Consumer Packaging business. Bob's career started at Mead about 30 years ago. His known converting experience includes consumer, corrugated, domestic and international assignments.","Bob has as broad set of experiences as any executive at WestRock. Bob's been instrumental in delivering more than $230 million in productivity improvements in the Consumer Packaging business. Our Consumer Packaging business is successfully implementing our differentiated strategy. I look forward to supporting the business in their drive to improve margins.","Home, Health & Beauty. Our Home, Health & Beauty business has been performing extremely well over the past few years. Fiscal 2016, our sales were $567 million. EBITDA was in excess of $100 million. Capital expenditures have been less than 5% of sales. The business has generated very strong cash flows that have grown \u2013 that we expect to continue to grow over the next several years.","The entire Home, Health & Beauty organization deserves recognition for what they have accomplished since the merger and many years before the merger. While the businesses fit well with WestRock's portfolio of packaging solutions, publicly-held peers of Home, Health & Beauty are valued at higher multiples than WestRock overall. And, in fact, our Home, Health & Beauty business may fit even better with another company.","Accordingly, our board has authorized us to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Home, Health & Beauty business. These alternatives include the potential sale of the business during the first half of calendar 2017. In the event we sell the business for cash, we expect to use the sale proceeds consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ward.","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. We're making great progress on monetizing our land and development portfolio. We completed the $13 million after-tax sale of a residential apartment complex during the quarter. As discussed on our previous call, we expect to realize one-half of the $275 million to $300 million in net after-tax free cash flow during fiscal 2017.","As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the September quarter in an annual run rate of $500 million. Fiscal 2016 productivity was driven by insourcing initiatives, procurement, actions to rationalize our footprint, return generating capital investments and merger-related synergies. We expect to achieve an $800 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017 and remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of fiscal 2018.","Fourth quarter adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $27 million, driven in part by unfavorable volume, the anticipated impact of price and mix and inflation of both input cost and labor. The impact of these three items was nearly offset by ongoing productivity improvements.","On a full year basis, combined company adjusted EBITDA declined by $51 million, driven by lower volume and favorable price and mix, wage and other input cost inflation. However, we were able to offset much of these items by delivering $384 million of productivity improvements.","In summary, both the quarter and the full fiscal year were successful. And I'd like to thank all of our employees for making this happen. As we look back at the first five quarters of WestRock, we have allocated $2.8 billion of capital. We have invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures over the last 15 months and continue to seeing numerous attractive return generating opportunities.","We returned $1.14 billion or almost half of the total to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of cash to stockholders via dividends and share buybacks will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy.","In the first quarter, we expect sequential earnings will be lower, in line with the seasonal pattern we experienced last year. I'd like to remind you that from Q4 fiscal 2015 to Q1 fiscal 2016 segment income declined by $88 million. We have outlined several of the drivers of the first quarter and full year on slide 12. For Q1, we anticipate that price and mix will be negative as the impact of the previously announced corrugated price increase will be more than offset by the flow through of the previously published consumer price decreases.","The first quarter is typically our heaviest maintenance period. And we're planning 160,000 tons of downtime. Volumes will likely decline, driven by four less shipping days in our container business. Consumer grade experienced seasonal softness in the first quarter as well. Inflation of input prices will continue in the period.","And, finally, Hurricane Matthew will negatively impact us by approximately $15 million to $20 million. These items should lead you to a first quarter adjusted EPS lower than what we delivered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, but increasing steadily as we make our way through the year.","For the full year of fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion, including approximately $150 million of land and development after-tax cash flow. We expect to invest approximately $750 million in CapEx. We also expect to realize significant productivity, as well as meaningful inflation in some commodity categories, including natural gas, recycled fiber and certain chemicals. Book tax rates are estimated at 34% to 35% and cash tax rates are in the high 20%s.","Steve, I will hand it back to you for closing comments.","Steven Voorhees","Thanks Ward. I'm proud of the progress we've made in our first full year as WestRock. WestRock offers a comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging products and services. This portfolio provides WestRock the opportunity to deliver winning solutions to our customers that help them win in their markets. We're doing just that. This is and will translate into great value for our customers, our employees and our stockholders.","We exceeded our productivity and free cash flow targets in fiscal year 2016. And we're looking forward to continued success in fiscal 2017. Our cash flow is the foundation of our balanced capital allocation program, investing our business through capital improvements and acquisitions and returning value to stockholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. And, as important as anything else, we have a terrific team and strategy. We're looking forward to driving even greater value creation in the future.","Matt, back to you.","Matthew Tractenberg","Thanks, Steve. I'd like to remind the audience that in the interest of time, please limit your questions to one with a single follow-up, if needed. We'll take as many as time allows. Dexter, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now, our first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. You may now ask your question.","Mark Wilde","Yeah. Ward, I wondered if you could \u2013 good morning. I wondered if you could help us a little bit more on the free cash flow guidance because it seems like between kind of CapEx down about $50 million, $150 million from land and development and $300 million from additional synergies you've got more tailwind than your current free cash guidance would suggest.","Ward Dickson","Sure. Let me walk you through the details of the $1.2 billion. I'll really highlight three things. You're right. We do have the contribution of $150 million from land and development versus a small use from land and development in fiscal 2015. In earnings, we have modeled in the implementation of the containerboard price increase. That's partially offset by the full year impact of the flow through of the previously announced PPW decreases in some of our consumer grades, along with the negative impact of input cost inflation. So, if you take our current pricings for some of our key raw materials and you compare that to the average of those prices in 2016, you can easily model between $175 million and $200 million of inflation on a year-over-year basis.","Our working capital and other balance sheet items should be a source as we expand some of our payment terms with our vendors through our supply chain financing programs. The other thing that I would also call out is that we've got some non-cash related earnings. I think we highlighted at the equity and non-consolidated affiliates. That's Gondi and it's also the portion of our land and development holdings that are not \u2013 where we don't have a consolidating interest. And we highlighted that as a negative $60 million for the full year.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And just, if I could, as a follow-on, just on this containerboard pricing front. I know it's a sensitive issue, but I'm just curious. Earlier in the year, there was a decline of about $15 in the linerboard price series in Pulp & Paper Week and there was a lot of talk that that wasn't large enough to trigger any contract adjustments in the box business. So, now with the containerboard price hike much more than that, I'm just trying to figure out whether there's any kind of a netting effect of the two.","Steven Voorhees","Jeff?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Hey, Mark. So, we have -","Mark Wilde","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Chalovich","A multitude of contracts and trigger mechanisms literally in thousands of customers, over 15,000 customers. So, we're not going to comment generally on that. We have communicated the $50 a ton price increase to our customer base and we will report on future calls on the progress.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. You may now ask your question.","George Staphos","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. My first question \u2013 what I'll do is I'll piggyback off of Mark's question on pricing and again recognizing it's not necessarily something you like to talk about in a public forum. Can you give us a little bit more color in terms of the aggregate pricing benefit or actually reduction that you're thinking about in the fiscal first quarter? Directionally, we know containerboard is up and we know you have the flow through on the consumer side that's negative. Is there a way to parse those and, if not, just aggregate those in terms of what we should be thinking about given today's pricing? That's my first question.","Second question, a totally different topic on Home, Health & Beauty. We're not terribly surprised by the announcement. We thought this is a good business within the whole of WestRock. But, in the past, Steve, you've talked about being a packaging company and dispensing systems being part of being a packaging company. Has there been anything that's changed in your view? Perhaps it's just valuation multiples. Does that suggest now is a better time to look to explore the valuation arbitrage, if you will, on that business? Thank you.","Steven Voorhees","George, on dispensing, it has fit well with us. I think you answered the question by saying its valuation multiples.","George Staphos","Do I get another one then? Just kidding.","Steven Voorhees","Yeah. So, Ward, take the first question.","Ward Dickson","So, George, on the first question on pricing, sequentially from Q4 to Q1, we said down slightly with \u2013 we will see some of the initial benefits of the containerboard price increase, but we will also see the continued flow through of the PPW reductions on the consumer grades. And, again, it'll be a small net negative between the two.","George Staphos","Okay. I'll turn it over. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. You may now ask your question.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ward, one more on the guidance. I know Mark asked you about the cash flow guidance. Can you talk about the implied EBITDA guidance based on everything you laid out in that guidance slide? Are you expecting full year EBITDA to be up or down relative to the $227 million that you generated this year?","Ward Dickson","It should be up. The primary drivers of the EBITDA change \u2013 we will continue productivity. The productivity won't be as high as it was in this fiscal year because we have the benefit of some of the merger related synergies in the first year. We will have more pressure related to inflation. And I size the input cost inflation and I'd remind you of the $120 million to $125 million worth of labor inflation that we have on top of it. So, we will be moving from a \u2013 as you look at the full year FY 2016 bridge where the net commodity deflation and wage inflation was only a negative $50 million, it's going to be considerably more unfavorable on a year-over-year basis. Productivity will be \u2013 you should expect productivity in the $325 million to $350 million range for next year. And then, we will have the pricing flow through in the containerboard, which will be partially offset by the full year impact of the PPW reduction from the consumer grades.","Adam Josephson","Okay. Just as a follow-on, I assume Home, Health & Beauty is in your full year cash flow and EBITDA \u2013 cash flow guidance?","Ward Dickson","It is. And it's \u2013 again, I would reference some of the key facts that Steve gave you. It's approximately just north of $100 million worth of EBITDA. Their CapEx is approximately 5% of sales. And so, we estimate that the free cash flow for the full year is around $60 million.","Adam Josephson","And that's included in the $1.2 billion?","Ward Dickson","That's included in the $1.2 billion.","Adam Josephson","Thanks a lot, Ward.","Ward Dickson","I would highlight, as you look at FY 2017 versus FY 2016, we also had a small source, less than $30 million, ultimately, from Ingevity in 2016. That was included in the full year number. And so, that obviously doesn't recur and shows that the underlying free cash flow of the business increases year-over-year.","Adam Josephson","Thank you, Ward.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research. You may now ask your question.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. I'm curious as to your sense how the corrugated market is feeling and this price increase is feeling relative to prior price increases that you have put through?","Steven Voorhees","Yes. Jeff?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Hey, Mark. So, currently, the industry fundamentals are really solid. Box demand is up 2.3% year-over-year in September and 1.6% year-to-date on an absolute basis. Consumption is up 2.8%. AF&PA inventories are down 272,000 tons year-over-year September. And inventories are sitting at 3.8 weeks. Operating rates are strong and high at 95.9%. And these are the highest we've seen since those times. So, fundamentals are very good.","Our system is extremely tight. We're having to repatriate tons out of the export market to meet our domestic demand and customers. Orders for our domestic containerboard are and are solid, about 95,000 tons year-over-year and 24,000 tons sequentially. So, we see the market fundamentals as strong and very good.","Mark Weintraub","And relative to prior increases is the \u2013 the way it's going, does it feel very similar? And just as a tag on, Pulp & Paper Week had put out a piece this weekend suggesting that the export price increases, even to Latin America, were, at least from their perspective, not really getting any traction. Do you disagree with that?","Jeffrey Chalovich","So, the first part of that is, I think, it's very similar from the last time from what I'd recall. The industry fundamentals are solid. And I think that's what we're experiencing.","Mark Weintraub","And on the export question?","Jeffrey Chalovich","I'm sorry. What was the export question?","Mark Weintraub","Pulp & Paper Week put out an article this weekend suggesting that the price increases to the export markets hadn't really been gaining traction. I did note you said that your prices were up $8 versus the prior quarter. But the current initiative \u2013 do you disagree with that assessment? Do you still feel that you have a good chance of getting traction on those price increases into the export markets?","Jeffrey Chalovich","We're communicating directly with our customers. Like I said, we're repatriating tons and we are communicating directly with customers on our pricing stance with them.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.","Brian Maguire","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning.","Brian Maguire","I just want to follow-up on the potential sale of Home, Health & Beauty. Just wondering if \u2013 what would be the priorities for uses of cash there? And maybe as part of that, you could just address the M&A landscape as you see it these days and what part of the portfolio you'd want to be reinvesting at this point?","Steven Voorhees","Sure. Whatever proceeds we get, we'll insert into our balanced capital allocation strategy. And we'll look at the relative merits of the alternatives we have at that time. I'd say M&A landscape is \u2013 I think we have a good deal flow across all of our businesses, so both in consumer and corrugated. And so, that's where we are.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Just as a follow-up. Just wanted to ask about the strength in the card in organic growth. I think it was up 2%. Maybe you could just dig into which grades and applications you're seeing the most strength in and how you kind of view inventories in that part of the business and just kind of the outlook for demand heading into fiscal 2017. Thanks.","Steven Voorhees","Yes. Bob?","Robert Feeser","Yeah. Hi, Brian. This is Bob Feeser. We're seeing stable demand across many of our consumer grades. As Ward mentioned, we will see the flow through on the published SBS and CRB reductions. But our demand is holding up well. We would expect to see normal seasonality in the December quarter. As we announced, our backlogs for SBS have improved to five weeks and CRB and CNK have improved to three weeks. So, demand is holding up well. CRB is probably one area that's a bit more pressured. But, overall, we're looking at a normal first quarter.","Brian Maguire","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank. You may now ask your question.","Debbie Jones","Hi. Good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning.","Debbie Jones","I wanted to talk about the $800 million in performance improvements, the incremental $300 million from the $500 million you've already got. Can you just talk about how difficult or different it will be to achieve those versus the initial $500 million?","Steven Voorhees","Yes. Debbie, Ward will take that one.","Ward Dickson","Hi, Debbie.","Debbie Jones","Hey, Ward.","Ward Dickson","What we've recognized so far we certainly have had the benefits of the merger related synergies, the reduction in the duplicate order costs. But I also highlighted the fact that we have internalized close to 250,000 tons in our consumer system. So, as we start to lap those benefits and move into FY 2017, the role of the procurement organization will continue to generate a third of those savings during FY 2017. We still have about half of the remaining SG&A reductions which are related to IP projects that will also occur during FY 2017.","Capital investments in our system to return generating capital investments will play a larger role. And then we will also get the full year benefit of some of the footprint actions that we have made across both systems. So, we will transition away from the merger related synergies related to the internalization. And then, we'll be more focused on capital and investments that were in return generating projects, procurement, and then just the other ongoing performance improvement programs that we have across the whole company.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Are these more skewed towards Consumer or Corrugated?","Ward Dickson","In fiscal 2016, it was more skewed to Consumer because of the internalization opportunities that we had as a result of the merger. As we move into fiscal 2017, it will be more balanced between the two businesses.","Debbie Jones","Okay. And just one more in this, the inflationary range you called out, $175 million to $200 million, is that just from raw materials or does that also include general cost inflation?","Ward Dickson","Debbie that was just raw materials. And what I simply did was I took current prices for some of our key commodities and compared it to the average for 2016. And then, on top of that, you should anticipate that we would have the normal wage and benefit inflation that I've highlighted in the $125 million a year range.","Debbie Jones","Great. Thank you. That's helpful.","Ward Dickson","Okay.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. You may now ask your question.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","In your guidance, you indicated you were planning downtime in Consumer Packaging in 1Q and 3Q. And I was wondering if it's possible to say which grades you're taking that downtime. And then just zooming in on CRB, we saw the price cut in September. What drove that and what's driven maybe a little bit more of a weaker environment in CRB in your eyes?","Steven Voorhees","Yes. Bob?","Robert Feeser","Yeah. Anthony, the downtime that we've highlighted is maintenance downtime related just to normal mill outages that we have both in the first quarter as well as the third quarter.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. Is that spread across all three grades?","Robert Feeser","Well, yes. It's spread between \u2013 primarily what you're seeing is SBS and CNK, a little bit in the CRB business, but it's mostly SBS and CNK.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. And then, in terms of CRB and the price decline in September, did that surprise you? And is there a reason that CRB seems a little bit weaker than the other two grades? At least from the outside it looks that way.","Robert Feeser","Yes. I would say that it was a bit of a surprise, although, again, we continue to see the fundamentals in CRB a little bit more challenging with the dry food market which is well published in terms of weaker demand in some of the processed foods, dry foods in particular. I think that is what's primarily contributing to a little bit of a weaker environment in CRB.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe one last one on containerboard. Understanding you can't discuss forward pricing. In the past when you've implemented price hikes, is it possible to say how many months it typically takes to realize the full flow through of the price hike?","Jeffrey Chalovich","No. Again, we've communicated the increase to our customers and we will provide more color on future calls.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies. You may now ask your question.","Philip Ng","Hey, guys. Box shipment to North America held up pretty well and it seems like things have picked up a bit in October. Just curious to get your thoughts. What's driving the resiliency? Any end markets that really stand out? And are you starting to see some of the initiatives that you made on the commercial front really flowing through a little more fully right now?","Jeffrey Chalovich","Yes. I think that's a fair representation. We are seeing our Ag markets up year-over-year. We have strong dairy. Some of our retail e-commerce is significantly up for us. And then our food service packaging business, which is our pizza business, and the company businesses that go with the pizza, so some of our clam shells and things that we ship with that, are up year-over-year. So, our demand and backlogs are very good going into the season. And we are seeing some of the commercial efforts that we've worked on pay off and really driving the differentiated solutions. And we have the most comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging products. And driving solutions with innovation is really paying off with our customers.","Steven Voorhees","And, Phil \u2013 go ahead, Phil.","Philip Ng","No. Please carry on.","Steven Voorhees","Okay. Phil, I was going to add back on to Jeff's comments. We've formed an Enterprise Solutions Group. And their job is to connect our customers to the full breadth of our product and service offerings, whether it's Corrugated or Consumer. We're in the early stages of doing this. It's been very well received by our customers and we're recognizing new business opportunities from \u2013 I think we've put out a release on those a month or two months ago. Craig Gunckel leads the group. And Craig's got 20 years of experience with us and he has a long track record of delivering sales growth across several of our businesses. So, this is a very important thing for our company over the long-term.","Philip Ng","Okay. That's really helpful color. And, Steve, that was actually one of my segues. Is there a bigger opportunity in Consumer or Corrugated in terms of some of these commercial initiatives? Or is it equally price lift, I guess?","Steven Voorhees","It's balanced. The portfolio fits very well together and we're able to go to our consumers agnostically between Consumer or Corrugated, different paper grades, to put together a tailor-made solution for their needs. So, our portfolio really fits well together.","Philip Ng","Okay. And just one last one on the corrugated side of things. Jeff, can you provide \u2013 I mean, you commented in the prepared remarks that backlog has certainly firmed up a bit in containerboard. Can you give us a sense how many weeks it in the quarter? How does that stack up year-over-year or sequentially? And good luck in the quarter. Thanks.","Jeffrey Chalovich","I'm sorry. Can you ask that again on the backlogs?","Philip Ng","Sure. You talked about containerboard backlogs have extended and firmed up a bit in fiscal fourth quarter. Can you just kind of frame how many weeks that was? How does that stack up either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis? That would be helpful.","Jeffrey Chalovich","I can just tell you that we track on our backlogs in box really five days and 10 days rolling. And so, we see the backlogs building on our five days. The lead times are very short there. And then we're booking a month out through our supply chain. So the backlogs remain strong or up sequentially for us.","Philip Ng","Okay.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA. You may now ask your question.","Mark Connelly","Thanks. Steve, I've just got one question. You said you saw about 2% organic growth in folding carton. Do you think that is a sustainable growth rate? And when you think about your willingness to acquire any opportunities, what do you think is a realistic top-line opportunity for folding carton over the next couple of years?","Steven Voorhees","Mark, I'm going to let Bob answer that.","Robert Feeser","Yes. Hey, Mark. We really like our position in folding carton. As we indicated, we saw 10% growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the Cenveo acquisition, but also the 2% organic growth. And we really believe that we're outpacing the industry in terms of overall growth that's flat to down. We've got a solid growth pipeline overall that we're executing against. It's a very well-run business. We're driving good productivity improvements. And we're continuing to make good investments and creating more capabilities in that business. So, we feel quite good about how we're positioned in folding carton.","Steven Voorhees","And then, Mark, I'll add. The business is \u2013 the majority of the business is food and beverage. And those trends have affected folding carton. I think our business, where we're integrated across all of our paper grades, we have the opportunity to, I think, grow organically probably faster than the industry, because of the breadth of offering we have in folding carton. We can offer CRB, SBS, and CNK.","Mark Connelly","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. You may now ask your question.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to kind of come back to probably your least favorite topic you've had this morning and that's price-oriented stuff. But I've heard you very carefully on a couple, four or five instances thus far say you've communicated with your customers a $50 ton price increase. I just wanted to kind of dive into that a little. As you sit today the beginning here of November, are you \u2013 you've communicated with customers. Are you, in fact, billing and receiving payments back for what you've put through? And then traditionally, that would equate to something, I don't know, 8%, 10% range as we think at downstream products. Are in you, in fact, communicated with them and billing and receiving for that as well?","Jeffrey Chalovich","So, we went to the market on box with a 10% and 12% communicated increase. And, well, we announced and communicated with our customers the $50 on October 1 in board and began billing the $50 ton increase on October 1.","Chris Manuel","Okay. That's very helpful. Second question I want to ask was it kind of comes back around to integration levels and in export and that type of stuff. So, I think, I heard you mention earlier, Jeff, that you were repatriating some board. But I was kind of thinking your integration rates were in the mid-upper 60%s. Can you kind of help me with where you sit today? Or maybe what you're talking about there? And then when we're thinking about those export markets, there've been some price announced there. It hasn't seen to gain a lot of traction. Do you think that that's something that over the next, call it, six months to 12 months we could see export prices come up as well? Thank you.","Jeffrey Chalovich","Sure. So, we are in the upper 60%s integration level. And if you look at some of the JVs we have where we have paper agreements, we're into the low 70%s. And so we look continually at our channel mix and how to increase in integration. Export is a part of our channels. We are repatriating paper and bringing it into the domestic market because of the strong demand we have in our box and domestic markets. We will and have communicated with our customers and the export markets. We did note that some of our prices on our large areas is up. And, again, we are communicating directly with them on pricing.","Chris Manuel","Thank you. Best wishes for the rest of the year.","Jeffrey Chalovich","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners. You may now ask your question.","Chip Dillon","Yes and good morning, gentlemen.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning.","Chip Dillon","First question has to do with \u2013 you mentioned in the slides the strategic options you're looking at for Home, Health & Beauty. And if I kind of interpolate from pre-acquisition, it would seem like the EBITDA there is probably in the range of $130 million or so and maybe revenues of $750 million, $800 million. Is that the rough ballpark as we think about what the prospects are for that business?","Steven Voorhees","We said $500 million and some odd of sales and EBITDA of over $100 million. With the merger, they had some folding carton business that we have integrated into our folding carton business, so that would account for the difference.","Chip Dillon","Okay. That's helpful. You're missing some sales, but not much EBITDA, it sounds like. And then, a second question, just looking at the industry, in general, it's been almost a record period, three-and-a-half years, since we saw Corrugated prices move up in North America. And one thing I've seen and recall in the past is when you've had a long period of time, unless whether it's your box plant managers looking at it at their own P&L level or your independent customers. We've had a long time where they have not had the opportunity to offset naturally rising cost like healthcare cost or the fact that people might get paid a little more every year.","And so my question is shall we read into the announced box price increase? I think you mentioned 10% to 12%. Some opportunity to capture some of those \u2013 to offset some of those cost increases, so that if I'm an independent player, I might actually see my realizations go up more than $50 because, obviously, if I'm paying $50 more for board, I need more than that to offset these other costs.","Jeffrey Chalovich","Sure. So I can't really speak to what the independents and others will do. I can speak to \u2013 we have a very rigorous process of how we manage our business and how we increase prices, track that and implement that. And whether it's during at time we've announced with our customers an increase or just normal course of business, we look to drive margins through other areas of our business. And that's through board rate optimizations. That's through efficiency gains. And so that's something we do as a matter of course with our customers. And we add value to them and help them drive total cost of use out of the system and improve our margins across our system.","Chip Dillon","I see. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman of Roe Equity Research. You may now ask your question.","Gail Glazerman","Hi. Good morning. I want to touch on containerboard inventories. Your 143,000 drop was quite significant relative to the industry decline of 272,000. And I know going all the way back to your Investor Meeting in 2013, you talked about carrying more inventory than four weeks. And, at one point, you had spotted a number that was much higher than the industry level. And I just want to know has that changed? And can you give any sense of where your current inventories are after that decline relevant to the 3.8 for the industry?","James Porter","This is Jim Porter. I'll take that one. You've heard correctly. We've put a lot of energy over the last two years investing in our supply chain processes and people to drive better systems and capability to match our customer requirements. That's the only reason we have inventories to ensure we've got the right products available on time for all of our channels. And so, you saw us early in our journey increasing inventories, but you've now seen them steadily decline. And I believe that's really the success of the implementations that we've had within our systems.","Our system currently is in balance. It was somewhat dinned by the Hurricane Matthew. So, what we \u2013 frankly, a little below where we should be at this point in time. And then, you will also see us needing to increase inventories slightly as we focus on next quarter's maintenance downtime. But we manage inventories at a very granular level and the trend line downward, I think, is a result of those initiatives.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. That's great. Just one last question. Of the cost that you've estimated for the storm, how confident are you in that? Is everything kind of back up and running or are there any kind of risks in terms of operation, logistic, fiber supply beyond obviously the comments on inventories?","Ward Dickson","Yes. So we \u2013 Gail, this is Ward. We tried to capture all of those factors when we gave you the range of the estimate. I would say 50% of that cost that we identified was related to the lost production and 50% of it was actually related to the additional maintenance repair and some scrappage cost that we had in the quarter.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. You may now ask your question.","George Staphos","Hi, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. Two questions, one kind of bigger picture and the other one more modeling related. On the latter, can you give us an update on what your thoughts for interest expense might be next year both cash and book, if there's any differences?","And then we just came back from a conference where there was a lot of discussion on light-weight, high-performance grades and containerboard. Can you remind us what your position is on that and how SP Fiber helps you there and, ultimately, over time, what percentage of the market you think that might be able to represent? Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","Ward Dickson","George, this is Ward. I'll give you the answer to the interest question.","George Staphos","Yes.","Ward Dickson","I would model about $225 million of net interest. That's the interest expense less the interest income and book and cash are virtually the same.","George Staphos","Thanks Ward.","Ward Dickson","Yes.","James Porter","So, on the question of light-weight \u2013 this is Jim Porter.","George Staphos","Hey, Jim.","James Porter","Good morning. I think we've all seen a trend of lighter basis weights over the last several decades. Largely, though, in the U.S. market, those have been in, I would say, the middle weight grades transitioning from 69 and 42 down into the 33s and 35s. When we speak about light weight of sub-26 pound that really has been largely unchanged. It was 5% to 6% 30 years ago. And, frankly, today, it's about the same.","Now, with that said, the Dublin mill has added some significant flexibility for us as we're able to go down really into the micro basis weights of 70 GSM or 14 pound board that we do have applications for. Our Corrugated business, some of the specialty food products grades, we now have the ability to integrate that with our own paper supply. So, we're quite excited about the future of that particular segment of the market.","George Staphos","So, Jim, implied in your answers is just you've got the capability but the fact that it's not really changed all that much tells you that the demand thus far domestically is \u2013 it's growing but not significantly. So would that be fair?","James Porter","I think that's exactly right.","George Staphos","All right. Thank you. I'll turn it over.","Operator","And, at this time, there are no questions. I'll turn it back to you, speakers.","Steven Voorhees","Okay. Matt?","Matthew Tractenberg","Thank you, Dexter. Thank you to our audience for your time this morning. We're proud of our progress. We appreciate your interest in WestRock. If you have questions following the call, the IR team is happy to help you. You could find our contact on today's earnings release. We look forward to speaking with you in the coming weeks. Have a great day, everyone.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you, all, for participating. You may now disconnect."],"22936":["WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 27, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","James Armstrong - Vice President, Investor Relations","Steve Voorhees - Chief Executive Officer","Ward Dickson - Chief Financial Officer","Jeff Chalovich - President, Corrugated Packaging","Bob Feeser - President, Consumer Packaging segment","Analysts","George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs","Steve Chercover - Davidson","Lars Kjellberg - Credit Suisse","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research","Anthony Pettinari - Citi","Debbie Jones - Deutsche Bank","Mark Connelly - Stephens","Scott Gaffner - Barclays","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets","Adam Josephson - KeyBanc","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Operator","Good morning. My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to WestRock's Fiscal Second Quarter Earnings Results Call.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We issued a press releases this morning and posted the accompanying slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our Web site. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via the link on the right side of the application you\u2019re using to view this webcast.","With me on today\u2019s call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Chalovich, our President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer period.","Before we begin, I'd like to point out during today -- the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and our 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.","Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our Web site.","So with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. WestRock team delivered strong results during the March quarter. We strengthened our capabilities and solutions offerings for our customers with the completion of the Plymouth Packaging acquisition and by reaching an agreement to acquire KapStone. Paper and Packaging markets remained attractive. Today we're benefiting from favorable demand, price and mix trends across our paper and packaging businesses.","Pulp & Paper Week published $50 per ton containerboard price increase in March. Also in March and April, PPW published price increases across all of our consumer paperboard grades. Most of our contracts include price adjustments based on the prices published in PPW. We are within one quarter of achieving our $1 billion synergy and performance improvements goal that we set at the inception of WestRock.","Our annual run rate at the end of March was $975 million. We expect to reach the $1 billion goal within the next two months. We generated $753 million in adjusted operating cash flow through March of this year. In January, we raised our fiscal '18 adjusted operating cash flow target to $2.45 billion and we remain on track to meet that goal. We are raising our full-year guidance for sales to $16.4 billion and we are raising our guidance for adjusted segment EBITDA to $2.9 billion.","Sales for the quarter were $4 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA was $669 million. This was an increase of 22% over last year for an EBITDA margin of 16.6%. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.83. This was up 54% over last year. Our adjusted operating cash flow increased by 27% compared to last year. Our team generated $64 million in productivity which merely offset costs and labor inflation of $66 million.","Recycled fiber costs in the second quarter were favorable. This was offset by increases in transportation, chemicals, and other input cost. Transportation represented the largest inflation driver in the quarter and it's one we believe will continue. Higher truck and rail rates are impacting the entire U.S economy and we're taking actions to reduce these costs, ensure that we can service our customers efficiently.","We are expanding the number of carriers we use. We are increasing the use of dedicated fleets to provide additional shipping options. The disruption caused by the large number and severity of the winter storms had a negative impact on our mill and converting networks across our businesses. Lower production, higher energy, and higher maintenance costs as a result of these storms had a $28 million impact on our financial results for the quarter. This was significantly more than the $15 million to $20 million estimate included in our guidance.","As a reminder, as I'm sure you can understand, we provided guidance in January and we could not at that time predict that we would have had additional severe adverse weather in March. The results of the quarter reflect the strong momentum in the business, with significant growth in our year-over-year financial performance.","We are making progress toward completing the acquisition of KapStone. As previously disclosed, the acquisition is subject to the approval of KapStone's stockholders. We are continuing to work through the regulatory approval processes in the U.S. and Mexico, and we expect the acquisition to close by the end of the September quarter or during the December quarter.","Our WestRock Corrugated Packaging team posted strong results in the quarter with adjusted segment EBITDA of $425 million. This was a 39% year-over-year improvement. Our North American corrugated adjusted EBITDA was $392 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%. This is a 460 basis points improvement over the prior year. I have been very pleased with the progress our Corrugated Packaging team has made, improving the performance of the business over the past several years.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin immediately after the Smurfit-Stone acquisition were only 12.7%. After several years of attention to the commercial and operational aspects of the business supported by capital investment, the team has achieved adjusted EBITDA margins for the past 12 months of 20%. This is an important milestone for the business. And our team remains committed to even more improvement over the next several years.","Corrugated Packaging continues to grow its position as [technical difficulty]. This was demonstrated over the past quarter by the growth in the industry box shipments of 2.6% year-over-year on an average week basis. This growth in demand supported U.S operating rates above 96% and inventories below four weeks of supply. We are seeing strong demand across all of our sales channels.","WestRock's North American corrugated box shipments increased 6.8% compared to last year. This volume increase was driven by the contributions from our recent acquisitions as well as strong demand in e-commerce, pizza and retail markets. April of 2018 has two more shipping days than last year. WestRock's box volume so far in April has increased approximately 2% on a per day basis and approximately 12% on an absolute basis.","Our machinery solutions offering is a key component of our differentiation strategy that contributes to our growth and enhances the value that we provide to our customers. The acquisition of Plymouth Packaging expanded our automated packaging systems business with the box on demand line of machines. Across our machinery businesses, we installed 77 machines during the second quarter. This brings total machine installations to more than 2,300.","During the quarter, we realized the benefits of the previously published containerboard price increases and improved channel mix. Our integration level for the quarter increased from 69% to 73% over the past year, primarily due to acquisitions. Of interest, increased sales volumes to our box plants were more than offset by reduced sales volumes to export markets. While prices to export markets increased over the last year, on average they remain less attractive than domestic markets.","Our sales volumes to domestic independent converters increased by 3% over the last year. And in the past 12 months we\u2019ve shipped more than 1.1 million tons of containerboard to this market. Sales of containerboard domestic independent converters remain very important to WestRock. We experienced interruptions to our operations during the second quarter due to severe weather conditions. These conditions affected both our mill and converting operations and resulted in the loss of $13 million primarily due to lost volume, under absorbed fixed cost and higher spot energy cost.","Net inflation in the Corrugated segment was minimal, because higher transportation of chemical and labor cost were mostly offset by lower fiber cost. Brazil, our Brazil team delivered extremely strong results during the quarter. EBITDA margins were 26.8% for the quarter. This was up 180 basis points sequentially and 740 basis points over the prior year.","Construction had our new Porto Feliz box plant is well underway and we expect this plant to start up in the second half of fiscal 2019. Our consumer packaging team faced challenges due to cost inflation and winter weather disruptions. We\u2019re well-positioned for improved performance as we move into the seasonally stronger second half of fiscal '18.","We are seeing strength in healthcare, beauty, personal care, food-service, and liquid packaging as well as in retail food. The strength is being offset by secular declines, commercial print and tobacco. Fortunately, these declining markets account for less than 10% of total segment sales. Our Machinery Solutions are important element of our differentiated strategy to serve beverage markets. We had a good quarter with 13 beverage machine replacements. We have a strong backlog machine orders for the second half of the year.","Our Paperboard backlogs improved through the quarter and are currently between five and six weeks on SBS and CNK and between four and five weeks on CRB. As I mentioned earlier, PPW published price increases in March and April across each of our consumer grades, and we're in the process of implementing these increases across our business as they flow through our contracts.","Paperboard and converted products volumes were stable. Our shipments increased 55,000 tons or 6.1% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by the volume associated with the multi-packaging solutions business. Adjusted segment EBITDA in the quarter was $243 million. Looking at the year-over-year bridge, volume declined or reflects the softness in merchandising display as well as lower pulp shipments.","Lower display volume was largely driven by promotional programs in fiscal '17 that did not repeat in fiscal '18. Input cost inflation unfavorably impacted the segment as we experienced transportation, chemicals, and labor cost increases. The OCC price reduction help offset some of these cost, but not to the same degree in the corrugated segment as our consumer mills used significantly less recycled fiber than our corrugated mills.","Like our Corrugated segment, the winter weather caused disruptions across our operations. We had a $16 million negative impact on the financial results for the quarter. Severe winter weather impacted all four of our virgin consumer mills. This resulted in lost production, higher energy cost and higher repair expenses.","During these storms we experienced production losses from the impact of freezing temperatures on machinery and power interruptions from local utilities. The consumer segment delivered yet another quarter of improved productivity. The $37 million in productivity were due to the benefits from our capital investments and procurement savings. They reflect the strength of our Six Sigma and performance excellence programs.","With initial implementation of the published price increases, seasonally improving markets, and the benefits of ongoing integration and productivity efforts, we expect this segment to deliver improved performance in the second half of fiscal '18.","Ward now I will turn it over to you.","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. We're making good progress on the remaining land and development portfolio and expect to achieve our monetization goals by the end of this calendar year. As Steve referenced in the June quarter, we will accomplish our goal of $1 billion of synergies and performance improvements that we initially set when we created WestRock.","Turning to Slide 10. We detailed the key assumptions included in our fiscal third-quarter financial guidance. We expect sequential earnings, adjusted earnings per share -- diluted share to be significantly higher than the $0.83 achieved in the second quarter. First, we expect EBITDA to increase by $75 million to $90 million as a result of sales price increases, seasonally higher volumes, favorable mix and continued productivity gains.","Second we expect maintenance downtime to increase 83,000 tons sequentially across our mill system. This will have an estimated $20 million cost impact quarter-over-quarter. Third, input costs are expected to be $15 million to $20 million lower than the second quarter. Recycled fiber costs have declined and this is expected to have a positive impact.","Based on a regional consumption mix, our average index price paid for recycled fiber in the second fiscal quarter was $102 per ton. Our average April index was $82 per ton. For the quarter, we are forecasting recycled fiber prices to remain flat with April's levels. However, noting the volatility, we've seen this year predicting recycled fiber cost remains difficult.","Combining these items, we expect that third quarter adjusted EBITDA will be sequentially higher $98 million to $118 million. Adjusted EPS will also be unfavorably impacted by $0.08 to $0.10 due to higher expected tax rate, higher depreciation and amortization and higher interest expense.","Turning to Slide 11. We're raising both our full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations by over $100 million each. We now expect to generate more than $16.4 billion in revenue and more than $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year. We are reaffirming our full-year adjusted operating cash flow guidance of greater than $2.45 billion, which we raised by a $150 million on our first quarter earnings call. Our estimated full-year adjusted book tax rate is approximately 25.5% versus our previous expectation of 27%.","In fiscal 2018, we are investing in strategic capital projects that will improve our business. Our investments in the Porto Feliz box plant, the curtain coater at our Mahrt mill and a new paper machine and our containerboard mill in Florence, South Carolina are underway. We expect investments in these projects to reach approximately $150 million this year. This is in addition to our base capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 of $850 million. We are positioned to deliver record financial results for the full-year with strong growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted operating cash flow.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thank you, Ward. WestRock's vision is to be the premier partner and unrivaled provider of winning solutions for our customers. The completion of the Plymouth acquisition and our announcement of the proposed KapStone acquisition in January, advanced our strategy by strengthening on our capabilities and the value we can provide our customers. This is translating into our financial performance. We are driving margin growth across WestRock through strong operating execution and solid business fundamentals.","We expect our fiscal '18 total company adjusted EBITDA margins will increase by more than 250 basis points to approximately 18%. Our team is committed to working together to help our customers achieve their goals using our portfolio of differentiated paper and packaging solutions. Through our strong execution, we will continue to improve our margins and grow our cash flow. We will use our strong cash flow to reinvest back into our business and make acquisitions that support our strategy.","We expect to return capital to stockholders by increasing our dividend over time and opportunistically repurchasing shares within our target leverage ratio. I continue to believe that this is a formula that provides significant opportunities for WestRock employees, WestRock customers and WestRock investors over the short and long-term.","That concludes my prepared remarks. James we're ready for Q&A.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience to give everybody a chance to ask a question, please limit your question to one with one follow-up as needed. We will get to as many as time allows. Lisa, can we take our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the details. Steve, I wanted to talk a little bit about -- a little about the projects that you have underway, the large box facility in Brazil, the curtain coater, the work you do in Florence. Obviously, you said the investments are $150 million, can tell us what the next mile markers are on these projects and them staying on budget both in terms of cost and ultimately performance improvement? And then my second question, you mentioned a couple of times in terms of the consumer and the corrugated business, the machinery solutions component which you\u2019ve been talking more and more about. Can you put into perspective for us what that growth or what the number of machine installations you talked to in your formal remarks means in terms of percentage growth, and how that's helping you in the market? Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","Okay. George, I\u2019m going to talk about Porto Feliz briefly, then I may ask Bob Feeser to talk about Mahrt, and then Jeff to talk about Florence and machinery. So just Porto Feliz, we\u2019ve broken ground, so there's a building going out and I think we expect to commence operations as we said in the second half of 2019. So that's the mile marker for the project. We expect to be operational as I said during the second half of 2019. Bob, Mahrt.","Bob Feeser","Yes. George on the Mahrt coater we are scheduled for April of 2019. The engineering is right on track and we feel very good about the progress on the project. It will have a -- as we talked about an important impact at Mahrt in terms of scheduling benefits, but also quality benefits for our product and cost reduction as well. So we feel we're right on track with that project.","George Staphos","Hey, Bob, just a quickie there. Is the Mahrt coater, is that bigger than a normal curtain coater, is that pretty standard for paper machine of that ilk?","Bob Feeser","George, it would be comparable to the curtain coater that we\u2019ve on number two machine at Mahrt. So \u2026","George Staphos","Okay.","Bob Feeser","\u2026 it\u2019s large. As you know that\u2019s a larger machine at Mahrt, but we've got experience with that technology of that scale with our other paper machine.","George Staphos","Thank you.","Jeff Chalovich","And George on Florence, we are on track. We are just getting started. We\u2019ve down payments on machine. We are getting permits. So we're on track and it's still early, but again that's a large project for us, 330 inch machine that will take out three older machines, narrow web, higher costs, so we\u2019re excited about the project and we\u2019re on track.","Ward Dickson","And, George, this is Ward to give you a perspective of the capital investment that we\u2019ve had over the first half of the year on these projects. We invested about $34 million in the quarter. About $20 million in the first quarter, so 50 -- just over $50 million in the first half. And then the Porto Feliz investment it's not quite, 50% of it is in this fiscal year and the remainder next year. The Florence capital investment obviously, the heavy investment period will be in FY19. And then the curtain coater is also more weighted towards FY\u201919 than FY\u201918.","Jeff Chalovich","And then on the machine piece, George, we continue to have two pieces to the machine. One, it helps our customers drive our total cost, its helping them internalize sales so they can sell more product, it streamlines our operations in the tight labor markets that are happening. These are solutions that are helping customers across their portfolio. For us, it has a great revenue pull and also has higher margins on our average brown box business, and it has stickier contracts. So these contracts are typically five years with high repeat rates up in the high 80%. So for us it's a large part of our growth and a significant part of our differentiation to our customers.","George Staphos","So, Jeff, the number you threw out, what kind of growth are we seeing, sort of just for clarification?","Jeff Chalovich","So the machine year-to-date in our APS group is over double where it was last year.","George Staphos","Okay.","Jeff Chalovich","We doubled that business year-over-year.","George Staphos","Thank you very much.","Jeff Chalovich","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. Thanks for the very clearly laid out presentation. I just had two questions regarding the pace at which pricing historically would typically get reflected both with the containerboard price increase having been -- having shown up in Pulp & Paper Week in March. If you kind of look back, how quickly does that typically translate into the box prices? And then likewise on the consumer side, how quickly did the pricing find its way into the contract and show up in the P&L?","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Mark. This is Jeff. I will start. As you\u2019ve seen in the last two that we've done is we\u2019ve been consistent, typically two quarters. So we will leave the September quarter at a full run rate of the $50, that's historically how we performed in the containerboard group.","Bob Feeser","Yes, Mike, this is Bob. On the consumer side, closer to three quarters. So with this recent round of increases that we\u2019ve communicated to our customers we're looking at full run rate implementation in the -- our first quarter of fiscal '19.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And so that is for \u2026","Ward Dickson","So Mark -- this is Ward. I was just reiterating the guidance that we gave for Q3 and then for the full-year reflected the implementation that both Jeff and Bob just described.","Mark Weintraub","Right. And Jeff its -- and typically recognizing that you would have full run rate by the end of that second quarter. Historically, what percentage on average would you had in the first quarter, so it get a sense of how much might be included in the guidance for the quarter ahead, that\u2019s there?","Jeff Chalovich","So, Mark, let me just correct the early part. It's by the end of our fourth quarter, our fiscal fourth, which is really the third quarter and its starts to phase-in. So, typically what you\u2019ve seen is, it's a 30-day lag and then there's multiple contracts and negotiations with customers. But when you pile all that together by the end of five or six months we\u2019re at a run rate of the $50 a ton.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just following on Mark's question there, the lags. Just specific to consumer, I know it's a little bit of a longer lag than in corrugated and the consumer markets have improved a lot in the last year, obviously your own backlog, the industry backlog has improved quite a bit, but it's enabled some of this pricing here. Just wondering if other than the pricing toggle, the other thing to think about is maybe trying to use some of the industry strength to try and reduce that lag going forward, which I think would structurally make the consumer business a little bit better. Is that -- do you see that as a potential option or opportunity in this tighter market as contracts come up? I know they\u2019re multiyear contracts, but as they come up do you see some scope or opportunity to reduce that lags to something closer to what we see on the corrugated side?","Bob Feeser","Yes. Hey, Brian, its Bob. This is very much top of mind for us and I think of an opportunity for us and certainly as we go forward in discussions with our customers, that\u2019s how we will be thinking about it.","Brian Maguire","Any early read on what the -- what obstacles customers might have to that? Obviously, I think they like some price protection, but two quarters seems like enough visibility for guys to be able to put their own price increases into effect. Any reason why you have historically it hasn\u2019t worked out that way?","Bob Feeser","You know the discussions with customers are very specific and each of them have their own dynamics, and we can't go into specifics around that. But as you might imagine in the consumer markets, in particular, with consumer products, that always is a big challenge for us. But again the discussions are very specific with each of those customers.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Maybe just one from Ward for me. Just wonder what the raised EBITDA guidance, with the maintained cash from ops, what the offset is in there? Is it working capital or some timing shifts or just what will cause that to not go up as well?","Ward Dickson","So, sure. Remember back in the first quarter we did raise the cash -- cash flow guidance for the impact of the lower cash tax rate for the year. So if I take the -- if I tax effect the $100 million EBIT -- EBITDA increase would imply a $75 million additional contribution to cash flow. We have some land and development sales that are straddling our fourth fiscal quarter and the fourth calendar quarter. So as compared to our original expectations that's a little bit of a use or less of a source. And then we do have a little bit of working capital usage because we have the higher receivables associated with selling price increases across both our corrugated and consumer businesses.","Brian Maguire","Okay. So that affects the timing shift, maybe start slipping into the first fiscal quarter, probably the fourth?","Ward Dickson","Yes.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from Davidson. Your line is open.","Steve Chercover","Thank you. Good morning. From the text and from your comments, it sounds like it's all systems go for the KapStone acquisition. I know that DOJ has evidently requested some additional Information, so is this just normal course or is this more rigorous scrutiny than for instance MPS acquisition?","Steve Voorhees","That\u2019s normal course. So we did receive the second request. We are working cooperatively with justice as it conducts its review of the proposed transaction and we continue to view the KapStone acquisitions as pretty competitive because it's going to enable us to serve our customers and improve our ability to compete. So we\u2019re remaining confident we\u2019re going to successfully complete the transaction without challenge from the Department Of Justice.","Steve Chercover","Terrific. And then my second question is for consumer packaging where sales were up -- much, much more than EBITDA. And I recognized the sale of HH&B is part of that, it wasn\u2019t a good transaction for you guys. So my question, I guess, is was -- were the margins higher in home health and beauty than in MPS, or is there just a noise?","Bob Feeser","Yes, Steve, as we indicated the margins in the quarter were really impacted by the winter weather as well as higher cost inflation. And as we look forward in the second half, margins will improve and we expect them to be in line with history. We are seeing very good demand environment for backlogs are strong, and we're implementing the price increases that we\u2019ve communicated to our customers. And we also had a really strong productivity quarter, and we expect that to continue in the second half of the year. So overall, we feel very good about the second half outlook around margins.","Ward Dickson","Steve, this is Ward. Home, health and beauty margins were higher than MPS's published margins. Now over time, we get to narrow that through the integration of the paperboard than the other synergy opportunities that we identified when we made the acquisition.","Steve Chercover","Great. Thank you. And just to be clear, I think it was a good sale, so thank you very much.","Ward Dickson","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Lars Kjellberg","Thank you. I just want to come back a bit to your external containerboard sales. You talk about taking volumes out of the export markets. Could you give some color on what sort of quantum we're talking about and when you\u2019re shipping out to export markets, where do you currently see the biggest pull in those markets? What region is being better than the others?","Steve Voorhees","Jeff?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, Lars. Good morning. So we are looking at driving integration into our internal system. As we talked about, we said a 5-year goal to be at 80%. But it's important to remember that we\u2019re managing the tails of all of our businesses. So export has the biggest delta, and so we want -- we don't want to be 20% export and be swung with the up and downs of the cyclicality in that, and we want better control. That doesn\u2019t mean though we won't take tail of box and move some of that to export where we have a better opportunity over the long-term. And we\u2019ve done that actually in the last two quarters. We\u2019ve exited some of our low-end national account business and have moved some of that back into the export to support customer contracts in other places that is a better channel price for us over the term. So we're addressing the channels. We like the export market. We think it's going to be a long-term good mark. We just don't want to be overexposed to that market. The pull, we had good season in Central, in Latin America, so that continues to be grateful. We see more coming into Middle East, Africa, and also Asia right now has high pull. So across our segments, all of them, export, internal domestic box are all very good demand profile right now.","Lars Kjellberg","Just to be clear [multiple speakers].","Ward Dickson","Our export shipments were actually down on a year-over-year basis by approximately 62,000 tons, and it was offset by increases in our box shipments and increased sales to our domestic containerboard customers.","Lars Kjellberg","Very good. I just want to continue on the same topic really on the consumer board side. The -- some of your peers are making very bullish comments about the domestic demand in Europe, but equally so in export markets. So two questions in that. Are you seeing a much improved market for European footprint in MPS? And are you seeing improved export opportunities from your -- especially the SBS business from the U.S platform?","Bob Feeser","Yes. Lars, this is Bob. In general, I would say it's about stable. We haven't seen a significant tick up in international or export opportunities across consumer. The markets that we're in are good markets and they\u2019re growing in their own right, so I wouldn\u2019t say that it's out of what we would normally expect.","Steve Voorhees","Lars [indiscernible] in Europe. MPS in Europe is performing very well, particularly the healthcare markets.","Lars Kjellberg","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Good morning. First question just a little housekeeping. It looks like you guys are saying that EBITDA improvement, if you tax effect it, it's around -- in the third fiscal quarter it's around $0.31, and so with the headwinds of 8 to 10, it looks like you're guiding to around $1.5. So if you could just confirm that and\/or correct me, and secondly in the full-year guide of $2.9 billion or so EBITDA, what is your assumption for OCC in the fourth fiscal quarter relative to the flat you see for the third?","Ward Dickson","Hey, Jeff. It's Ward. So I think -- your question about the Q3 guidance, I think you played back to me the -- our chart is accurate, so -- and easily understood. So -- and then as I think about the full-year, we have a -- approximately $20 per ton sequential increase assumed in -- from Q3 to Q4.","Chip Dillon","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. You all were very less domestically focused before, MeadWestvaco and now you've had some good experience -- I\u2019m talking containerboard now in South America with quite a bit of success. What are your thoughts about Europe and now that you have exposure there in consumer, what are your general thoughts about Europe as a containerboard market, for containerboard and boxes, especially given some of the different dynamics there regarding fiber?","Steve Voorhees","I think we\u2019re happy with the footprint that we have now, and can't really speculate on how Europe looks to us for containerboard.","Chip Dillon","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. Just had a question on transportation. I think you said freight was the biggest hit in the quarter sort of relative to your expectation. Is it possible to quantify or put a finer point on how much that hit was? And is that something that we can carry into fiscal 3Q or maybe even get a little worse or better as you undertake some of these actions in the trucking market?","Ward Dickson","Yes. So the freight inflation that we incurred in the quarter relative to our expectations came very close to directly offsetting the lower OCC versus our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. If I look at our domestic mix, I mean, we are about just over 60% truck and we are experiencing mid double-digit inflation on truck frieght. Intermodal is about 10% of our mode mix. And again its north of 10% inflation and then rail is about -- almost 30% of our mode mix and it's been more stable. It's been in the -- less than 5%. So that -- that's what we have seen -- saw on the quarter and the expectation for our total freight costs for the full-year would be inflation that's approximately 10% inflation.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on the corrugated side, you saw box volumes increase almost 7% in the quarter. I think you said April volumes were up around 2% per day thus far. I\u2019m not sure if I heard that correctly, but is that the right number? And if so, does that represent a deceleration or is there -- I don\u2019t know an M&A effect or how do you think about the volumes you\u2019ve seen in April in corrugated versus very strong volumes in the quarter?","Steve Voorhees","You\u2019re right. That was 2% on a per day basis, but there's two more shipping days in April. So on an absolute basis they are up 12%.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. So maybe [multiple speakers]","Steve Voorhees","So our [indiscernible] continue to remain strong. So I wouldn\u2019t read any slow back or decline based on there being more shipping days in April.","Anthony Pettinari","Got it. Okay. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Debbie Jones","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question in consumer just focusing on the volume number. I know that the negative number that would typically had to do with promotional display, if you called that out. I just wanted to understand when does that kind of lapped and how is that business performing? Should we expect a material sequential impact as we progress through the rest of the year in that business?","Steve Voorhees","I don\u2019t think I would expect a material sequential impact in -- but we did have -- we had two great promotions last year and we just didn\u2019t have the same great promotions this year. So display is a great business, it's for us. It just fits with our approach to the market. It's well integrated with our mills, but it's even better integrated with the approach that we take to the -- take to our customers, because our customers are working to promote their products. And display gives us a just on point ability to support our customers success, such a very integral part of our value proposition.","Debbie Jones","Okay. And then just if I can move to corrugated, you have been pushing to move your tons more domestically towards your customers in the U.S. Where are you with that strategy? It's just the export market seems to be quite strong, pricing seems to be moving higher. I\u2019m just wondering if there's any shift in strategy there?","Jeff Chalovich","Hey, Debbie, its Jeff. The strategy is to over the next 5 years to look at integrating 80%, that still puts a bunch of tons into export. And again, it gives us optionality in the tails of all of our channels. We are interested in the best margins over the long-term of our business, whatever channel that\u2019s in. Then we believe that an 80% integration as a midpoint is not a black and white answer. It gives us optionality into other channels. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do is create optionality and take advantage of the best channels where we can generate highest margins.","Debbie Jones","Okay. I will turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly","Thanks, Steve. Can you talk a bit more about the volume side of consumer ex merchandise display? You\u2019ve obviously made some choices about the kind of business you want to be doing. So can you tell us where you see the carton volume side going and whether you have more pruning to do?","Steve Voorhees","Mark, I\u2019m going to let Bob Feeser respond to that.","Bob Feeser","Yes. Hey, Mark. So as you know with the MPS acquisition that was an important shift in the mix of the business overall. So roughly 43% to 45% of the portfolio is in health and beauty, personal care, food-service, and liquid packaging. We see those businesses -- or those end markets growing well above GDP. And then the 45% of the portfolio is in our food and beverage traditional business and then the 10% that we had indicated in tobacco and commercial print. So that gives you a little bit of a feel for the overall mix of the business. We feel good about that mix and we want to continue to shift to those higher growing markets in health and beauty. Again, that was an important reason for the MPS acquisition.","Mark Connelly","Where is the food and beverage side going? Are you seeing stability in demand or is that still shrinking?","Bob Feeser","Yes, I would say overall volumes are stable. As you know in the beer market mainstream beer's been flat to down and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, but that's being offset by growth in Craft Brew. And then same in carbonated soft drink as well, being offset by sparkling. But in general flat to maybe up 1% overall. And then in the food markets, I would say down 1% to flat. But I think those trends are stabilizing and we\u2019re seeing that in our business as well.","Mark Connelly","Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Just wanted to clarify something in regards to the guidance you instituted this new EBITDA measurement that you\u2019re guiding to for 3Q. For the full-year though this $2.9 billion of EBITDA, is that segment EBITDA or is that segment EBITDA associated with EPS?","Ward Dickson","So if you actually look at the first -- over the first half of the year, the primary drivers of the adjustment is when we back out the L&D, either the L&D sales and earnings. And so if you look at the course of the first half, the material -- it's really not a material change between those two metrics over a long period of time. So it's one in the same for the full-year.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Just FYI, it's a little bit confusing to have two different EBITDA metrics, but just maybe something to look out in the future. In regards to the KapStone acquisition, Steve, I know you already answered this question, but when you did release the update on the second request from the DOJ, you mentioned that that the acquisition could twist [ph] into the fourth quarter from the third quarter. So that would suggest something maybe changed -- minimal change to the outlook there. Is it more material that they\u2019re requesting or what\u2019s driving the possibility of a delay?","Steve Voorhees","I think it's just we got a second request and so that put the potential for that slippage in there.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. And then just lastly, if I look at Brazil, can you give us a box shipment growth in Brazil in the quarter?","Steve Voorhees","I think they were up about 3% year-over-year.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Ward. Nice quarter.","Steve Voorhees","Hi, Mark. Thanks.","Mark Wilde","I got just two questions. One I wondered, Steve, if it's possible for you guys to talk a little bit about your strategy or kind of filling in, in Latin America. You\u2019re in the two biggest economies right now, so maybe sort of expansion in Brazil and Mexico and also kind of in some of the other countries in the region and whether that might actually contribute toward your 80% integration? And then the second question I had is just whether in a good market like this you have an opportunity to move away from the dependence on the Pulp & Paper Week pricing in both corrugated and consumer. I think it strikes a lot of us is kind of strange that we got a $50 billion industry that\u2019s being arbitrated by trade paper editors.","Steve Voorhees","Okay. So take Latin America, and then I will talk about PPW. I think you\u2019re right. Latin America is a terrific opportunity for us. I think just Mexico and Monterrey, we're investing in box capacity, we also have a new paper mill going up in Monterrey adjacent to the new box plant that is just coming into service in Mexico. Gondi has been a terrific investment for us and when we looked at it, one of the opportunities we saw was continued investment in Mexico. I think also in Brazil we\u2019re investing in the box plant. Both our investments in Gondi and Brazil allow us to increase our integration. And I think with respect to filling in, we supply a significant amount of containerboard, primarily for agricultural uses in Central America and the Western part, South America. I think that\u2019s a potential growth for us over time as well. I think with respect to the PPD -- PPW pricing mechanism, I take your point, I agree with your point and it's been there for as long as you've been in the business, as long as I\u2019ve been in the business. I think it's hard to necessarily see a path away. I expect it's going to continue to be a subject of conversation for some time.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Good enough. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc Your line is open.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two questions for me as well. One on guidance. Ward, can you just help me with the moving parts in your EBITDA guidance. I know you said sales and EBITDA are up by a 100, I would presume that your OCC cost expectations for the year is also down. So can you just help us with what change compared to three months ago in terms of the EBITDA? Second question just on OCC longer-term, as a company with a significant amount of virgin and recycled assets, what is your view of longer-term OCC prices? Obviously, some industry participants have been of the view that that OCC has got to go up over time because of global containerboard growth, but that hasn't happened in recent years. So if you could just address those two, it would be great. Thank you.","Ward Dickson","Adam, this is Ward. Let me -- I\u2019m going to take you back to our guidance at the beginning of the year and then I'll walk you through we -- for the full-year, and then walk you through to where we are today. So back in November, I highlighted that I thought the overall commodity inflation would be about $90 million, and I think our full-year average at that point in time for FY18 for recycled fiber, we\u2019ve assumed that it would drop $7 per ton versus our average for FY17. And then in January we said, look our total inflation outlook hasn't changed. The additional reductions that we had experienced in the first half -- I mean in the first quarter relative to our original expectations for recycled fiber had been offset by higher freight and chemicals costs. And here we are now in April and it's remarkable how it's -- our outlook is very consistent in terms of what that overall commodity inflation is relative to the initial expectation that we said at the beginning of the year. So as I said, we've laid out what the OCC assumption is. And again it has a $20 per ton sequential increase from Q3 to Q4. And then it's been offset by the dramatically higher freight cost than what our original expectations were. And again when I was talking about what our inflation have been for truck, it's been in the mid-teens. And then -- so the inflation expectations are remarkably consistent, albeit from very different drivers from the guidance we said at the beginning of the year. We're getting the benefits from the price -- the recent price increases that we -- published price increases that we did not have in the guidance at the beginning of the year, okay?","Adam Josephson","Thanks for that, Ward. Yes, thank you. And then on the longer term OCC question?","Steve Voorhees","Yes. I can't really speculate on what prices are going to be. I think just a couple -- couple comments. The global containerboard market is really attractive. So it's over a 160 million tons and it grew 4.3% last year. So it's a -- and its expected to continue to grow, and so we\u2019re going to need both virgin and recycled capacity over time. I like our position because we have a nice mix and I think as the markets change we're going to adapt -- we are going to be able to adapt. In Brazil, we've got terrific virgin model. In Mexico we are building a terrific recycled mill and our U.S containerboard operations are very well-balanced. So I like our position in containerboard. I think it's a nice market to be in. I can't -- don\u2019t really know what recovered fiber price are going to do. China is interesting because their import volumes are down almost 50% in the past -- I mean, just -- and so you have a market which has that significant a player impacting prices, it's just hard to see where prices are going to go. So we\u2019re going to stay flexible and be able to adapt where the market goes.","Adam Josephson","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research. Your line is open.","Gail Glazerman","Hi. Good morning. On the consumer side, on Pulp & Paper Week last updated prices, they made a pretty significant distinction between the folding carton and the food service market. And I just wanted to know is that consistent with your experience? And if so, they seem to be attributing it to kind of -- the specter of imports. And I\u2019m just wondering what your view is there?","Bob Feeser","Yes. Hi, Gail, it's Bob. So we\u2019re seeing both general folding carton as well as the food service markets firm at the moment. And I think that what was reflected in Pulp & Paper Work Week on the cup portion, really reflects the strength of the food service market right now. And as you know that's continued on for some number of quarters. But our folding carton business as well, it goes into many end markets, at this point it is very firm.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And just any view on whether or not you\u2019re seeing incremental in core pressure than what you might have, let's say a year-ago?","Bob Feeser","No. Really no significant change from a year-ago.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And then, my next question is on inventory, just with some of the operational headaches and weather disruptions you had in the first quarter -- in the second quarter, just how you view where your inventories stand just directionally where they moved and how you -- and also how you view them in the context with some of the freight issues going on?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, Gail. It's Jeff. I will start with the containerboard. So we were trying to build inventories going into the outages. We were affected with the weather about 35,000 tons. We didn't build as much as we thought. So we did pull from some inventories. However, our supply chain responded well and we have a minimum that we need for stock. So the box plants have been in good shape. It's not -- there's not a lot of room. So we\u2019re making and shipping every ton of paper we can and so there's not a lot of room for error. And then on the freight side, it does exacerbated. However, we're looking at all the things we can do to control those things, so lading of trucks, railcars, getting incremental drivers, moving shipments around so that we can do more turns with our trucks to manage our inventories. So it's just a logistics challenge that we have to manage through and we\u2019re managing through that well, and believe we're set with our inventories going into a large outage for us in the third quarter.","Gail Glazerman","Okay.","Ward Dickson","Hey, Gail. Its similar on the consumer side on the inventories. Very similar story overall and as you might imagine in some portions of consumer, in CRB, in particular, there is very little inventory in the channel overall. So the market conditions are quite tight.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-on. Just a quick one. Piggybacking, I think, off of a question that Brian had asked, so if we look at consumer over the next -- I don\u2019t know five years and we see the evolution of your business by end market. Would it be natural that the lag that you typically see in terms of -- the price increase being reflected in Pulp & Paper Week and when you ultimately implemented that gap narrowing just by itself aside from whatever actions that you take. Said differently, do you have more ability to implement pricing in food service and some of the other growth areas of your business more quickly than you would -- your more traditional food and beverage market? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Ward Dickson","George, I think it's hard to speculate on future pricing. I like very much the platform we have with consumer and corrugated. I think we\u2019re able to go-to-market and serve our customers in a distinctive way because of the portfolio we have. It's really hard to carry that through to how contracts are going to work in the future.","George Staphos","Okay. We understand. We will pick it up at some other point. Again, good luck in the quarter.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, George.","Ward Dickson","Thanks.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue.

[Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Matthew Tractenberg. Sir, you may begin.","Matt Tractenberg","Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our FY16 third quarter earnings call. My name is Matt Tractenberg. I am WestRock's new Vice President of Investor Relations and I am excited to be here. I am joined this morning by Steve Vorhees, WestRock's Chief Executive Officer; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Porter, President of our Paper Solutions business. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we discussed during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015.","Additionally, we will be referencing adjusted or non-GAAP, financial measures during the call. We have provided reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of this slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website. With that said, I will turn the call over to you, Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks for joining our call. For those of you who have not yet met Matt, Matt joined WestRock in May. He has 10 years of investor relations experience. I'm very happy Matt has decided to join our team here at WestRock. I want to start by taking a moment to look back on the first year of WestRock. It's been an exciting year, one that has had many accomplishments. The merger has gone extremely well and now, a year in, I'm pleased to report we've brought together a great team, created a great Company with the size and scale to succeed in the marketplace and deliver attractive and increasing cash flows to investors.","WestRock holds the number one or two market share positions in attractive packaging markets. We're providing differentiated packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace and our broad portfolio of products and services is resonating well with customers. We're delivering on the expectations that we outlined at the outset of the merger.","These expectations fall into three overall categories, cash flow, productivity and the use of our balanced capital allocation strategy to create long term value. Beginning with cash flow, we managed our business to maximize our long term cash flow returns and we executed well on this objective during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $532 million, with $106 million coming from the reduction of inventory in our corrugated and Consumer Packaging businesses.","We expect that our full-year FY16 adjusted free cash flow will exceed $1 billion. This was the upper end of our previously stated guidance. This highlights the strength of our business model, the capabilities of our team, our leadership position in the marketplace. It is worth pointing out that WestRock stock continues to provide an attractive, free cash flow yield of nearly 10% at the current share price.","Next, productivity, improving productivity requires us to mobilize our Organization, getting literally hundreds of projects defined and completed. WestRock's teams are getting a lot done to improve productivity. This is demonstrated by the $105 million of productivity benefits realized in our quarterly earnings and our current annual run rate of synergies and performance improvements of $425 million. Our balanced capital allocation strategy includes paying an attractive dividend, reinvesting in our businesses, pursuing acquisitions that improve our business and repurchasing WestRock shares, all while keeping leverage within our targeted range of 2.25 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Over the past year, in addition to the $1 billion that we returned to stockholders, we invested $1.4 billion back into our business through more than $800 million in capital expenditures and approximately $600 million in acquisitions, including our joint venture with Grupo Gondi.","This quarter we successfully completed the separation of Ingevity. I'm pleased to see the stock perform well. WestRock shareholders who have held on to their Ingevity stock have over $6 per WestRock equivalent share of additional value. All told, we're executing well on our strategy and this is reflected in our results for the quarter. During the quarter, we performed well across our businesses. Sales for the June quarter were $3.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $0.71. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $611 million or 17.3% of sales, driven by strong capture of our synergy and performance improvement opportunities.","Adjusted EBITDA margins improved by 190 basis points in the Consumer Packaging segment versus the prior year. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $373 million in the quarter. This brings our fiscal year-to-date free cash flow to slightly more than $800 million. Then how about this? Over the last 12 months, we achieved more than $350 million in productivity benefits that positively impacted our income statement and cash flow. Our leverage ratio at quarter-end was 2.33 times. This is within our targeted range. We repurchased 1.2 million shares in the quarter, bringing the total to 12.5 million shares or almost 5% of the outstanding shares over the past 12 months.","Our Corrugated Packaging team executed very well in the quarter, with North American adjusted EBITDA margins of 18.3%. This is an increase of 80 basis points sequentially. Our North American box shipments declined by 2% on a per day basis from the very strong prior-year quarter. Our fiscal year-to-date box shipments have increased over the last year and in July, our box volumes have increased 1.7% on a per day basis over last year. Our backlogs are higher than last year. I am very encouraged by our new business pipeline that's up significantly over last year and is a leading indicator of volume growth.","Our box prices declined $16 per ton from the prior-year period as a result of the previously published pulp and paperweight container board price declines. Sequentially, third quarter box pricing declined by only $6 per ton. Shipments of domestic container board were about the same as last year. They were up slightly sequentially. Prices of domestic container board were flat sequentially. Current North American container board markets are healthy, with industry operating rates at 95.6%. Industry daily box shipments increased by 1.5% in June over the prior year. Container board consumption increased 2.4% in June and industry inventory levels declined and are now down to four weeks of supply.","Shipments of export container board decreased slightly from the prior year and increased slightly sequentially. Our mix of export business was unchanged, with approximately 60% to Latin America and the rest split between Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Export pricing declined only $2 per ton sequentially. The negative price mix across our box, domestic independent and export customers had a pre-tax impact of $41 million in the quarter as compared to last year. This unfavorable impact was directly offset by ongoing productivity improvement efforts.","Sequential changes in pricing and mix reduced income by less than $15 million which reflects very favorably on our disciplined approach to the market. We balanced our supply with our market demand by taking 72,000 tons of economic downtime in the quarter. In addition, we took 60,000 tons of maintenance downtime. The joint venture with Grupo Gondi, the premier operator in Mexico, is now complete. As a reminder, we hold 25% ownership interest in the partnership. Their exceptional team and exceptional assets provide us with a growth platform in a very attractive market. In the quarter, we shipped 67,000 tons of container board to the joint venture.","We anticipate our shipments into Mexico will increase going forward, both from additional integration opportunities, as well as from strong growth opportunities. We're reporting Gondi's results in the equity investment line on the income statement. For the three months in the June quarter, Gondi's sales were $188 million and EBITDA margins exceeded 20%. I would encourage you, for the purpose of valuation to include our share of their EBITDA at an appropriate multiple Based on our independent purchase price valuation as of the time of formation of the joint venture, this was in excess of $1 per share for WestRock's interest. Gondi's management is led by Eduardo Posada and they've moved quickly to deploy additional capital available to them as a result of the joint venture. This includes the announcement of the acquisition of the Aluprint folding carton business and the order of 11 new production lines from Bobst and BHS that will be used to upgrade existing Gondi plants and capitalize new plants.","In Brazil, our performance remains strong, despite the continued challenges the country faces, With EBITDA margins of almost 23%, our combined corrugated box and container board shipments increased by 5% compared to the prior year. Our year-to-date box volumes are tracking the industry, down 2.3% and we're implementing price increases to mitigate input cost inflation. The Tres Barras Mill is running well and we're capitalizing on strong mill performance and weak local currency to profitably export liner board to offset the impact of a soft domestic box market. As we indicated on our last call, we expected inflation in natural gas, recycled fiber prices during the third quarter to begin to have an impact. This played out as we anticipated, as seen in the recycled fiber prices which were higher by $7 per ton. An increase in natural gas prices has started to impact us this fourth quarter, but prices are still down as compared to last year.","The average NYMEX natural gas price for the third quarter was $1.95, lower than the current strip of $2.82 for the second half of the calendar year. Overall, the Corrugated Packaging team navigated the market extremely well, offsetting price with productivity improvements and aggressively executing our commercial strategy. I will now turn to our Consumer Packaging business. We drove meaningful adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points from the prior-year period. This was on solid productivity and integration synergies. Consumer Packaging net sales for the quarter were $1.64 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $275 million.","We're in the process of integrating 250,000 tons per year in SBS volumes from both internalized consumption and the Carolina business. Pricing was stable in our core markets in the quarter, as the published price reductions covering SBS, CRB and URB in Pulp and Paper Week had limited impact on our results at this point, given our differentiated strategy, portfolio and mix. We delivered $59 million in productivity improvements year-over-year, reflecting the great progress we're making in integrating our Consumer Packaging businesses and realizing the synergies and performance improvements across our expanded platform. Demand has been stable in our folding carton and beverage packaging grades, as well as an our merchandising displays, home, health and beauty groups.","In our consumer mills, industry backlogs improved during the second half of the quarter, particularly in SBS; we're now above prior-year levels. We're entering the quarter with backlogs of five weeks. Of note, we're continuing to see solid demand growth from hot and cold drink cups. In SBS, we're seeing limited penetration at this point from European and Asian competitors. CRB is the softest grade due to continuing pressures on packaged food categories such as cereals, crackers and snacks. Our backlogs for CRB and CNK range from two to three weeks. Beverage had a strong quarter, posting improvements in profitability versus prior-year due to productivity.","We continue to achieve gains in global beer and sparkling water markets which offset the continued weakness in traditional carbonated soft drink demand, primarily North American. We continue to grow with customers that have packaging needs that correspond well with our strategy and capabilities, including craft brewers, new product introductions and paperboard multi-packs in Latin America and China.","Our folding carton team performed very well in the quarter and is executing on our differentiated strategy. Organic sales growth was up slightly as compared to a slight decline for the overall folding carton industry. Integration of the Cenveo facilities into our folding carton business has been successful. As part of the integration, we announced the closure of a former Cenveo facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This closure, as well as internalization of mill tons, is driving $12 million of current run rate synergies. We're projecting $17 million of total synergies associated with the Cenveo transaction; this is $10 million more than originally projected. Using the acquisition purchase price of $98 million, we paid 3 times EBITDA after synergies. This is a terrific transaction for WestRock.","Home, health and beauty results significantly exceeded the prior-year, driven by strong sales executions on growth and mix improvement initiatives, cost containment and operating productivity. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter were at a record for the business and were several hundred basis points higher than prior-year. Revenue was 4% higher than prior-year, due to growth in North America, Europe and Brazil. In merchandising displays, customer promotional activity has stabilized and we're seeing year-over-year growth with many of our customers. Our cost actions had a positive impact on results and we're seeing sequential adjusted EBITDA improvement the last two quarters.","As part of our long term strategy to balance capacity and investment with market demand, we announced the closure of our Chicago manufacturing facility in April. We anticipate the cost savings of that closure to have a positive impact in FY17. Now I'll turn the call over to Ward, who will talk about the progress we're making with our land and development business, our synergy capture and other financial topics. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. We made significant progress this quarter and completed a detailed review of projects and strategy within our land and development portfolio. Segment sales for the period were $42 million and segment income was $10 million. We accelerated the sale of the Walworth property and the $27 million in proceeds was more than expected. We have been engaged since January with our Charleston-based team and an outside real estate advisor on a project-by-project review to determine the best path forward to maximize value, accelerate cash flows, reduced development costs and risks. We now expect to complete the accelerated monetization of the portfolio within the next 24 to 30 months and realize gross sales proceeds of approximately $600 million.","After distributing our partners' ownership interest and paying off project-specific debt, we expect to realize after-tax cash flows of approximately $275 million to $300 million, in line with original purchase price estimates. More than one-half of this cash flow should be realized by the end of FY17. The original book value in the merger accounting was approximately $400 million on a pre-tax basis. As Steve indicated, we continue to execute very well on our synergy and performance improvement objectives. We exited the June quarter at an annual run rate of $425 million. We have generated benefits from the optimization of our consumer mill system, including the internalization of the Carolina tons and the outside bleach board purchases for our folding carton operations.","In addition, we're realizing savings from our footprint actions in both business segments. We continue to make capital investments that reduce costs, such as our EVOL deployment and press upgrades in our converting operations. WestRock's size and scale has led to sourcing benefits across our raw material purchases. We expect to achieve a $500 million run rate by the end of the fiscal year which is the upper end of our previous range and we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion goal by the end of FY18. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined by $23 million. We had a $20 million unfavorable volume decline, primarily within Consumer Packaging.","The $39 million unfavorable impact of price and mix was due primarily to our Corrugated business. However, we have benefited from commodity deflation, as lower natural gas and wood prices more than offset increased recycled fiber cost. Labor cost inflation more than offset these lower energy and material costs. We remain committed to our ongoing productivity initiatives and expect them to continue to contribute meaningfully going forward. The small FX impact of only $4 million reflects our primarily U.S. dollar revenue base. And finally, pension income was lower by $18 million, a non-cash impact reflecting our successful pension derisking plan.","I am pleased with the strong cash flow we have generated through the third quarter which gives us confidence to say we will exceed our $1 billion adjusted free cash flow target for the FY16. We're a Company that generate strong cash flow and believe that this metric is important when valuing WestRock. Some of the key business drivers for the fourth quarter are as follows. First, we anticipate inflation of input cost, including natural gas and recycled fiber. And we're planning major maintenance outages with our Consumer Packaging mill system that will have an approximately $11 million pre-tax impact.","Additionally, we recognized a $10 million pre-tax benefit during Q3 from our Walworth land sale which sold for more than its stepped-up value. We do not expect to repeat these gains in the fourth quarter and expect a sequential $10 million decline in land and development earnings. However, while these items will result in a sequential decline in adjusted earnings per share, we continue to work aggressively to capture commercial opportunities while controlling cost. We have protected our significant overfunded status in our U.S. pension plans and that has paid off.","We matched our investment strategy with our pension liability so the decline in interest rates has no impact on our overfunded status, as our assets and liabilities move in tandem. We were overfunded by 107% against our GAAP liability which translated to a $450 million overfunding as of July 15. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan. Steve, I will hand it back over to you for closing comments.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, Ward. Let's look back at the first year of WestRock. We have allocated $2.4 billion of capital. We have invested $841 million in capital expenditures. We expect to invest $800 million to $825 million during this fiscal year. This includes the Ingevity funding prior to the separation. While we've completed our capital expenditure plans for FY17, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million. We estimate our annual maintenance capital needs to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. We see numerous attractive return-generating opportunities providing between 15% and 25% unlevered after-tax returns on these investments.","Over the past year, we have returned $1 billion or more than 40%, to $2.4 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. This return of capital to stockholders will continue to be an important part of our capital allocation strategy. We continue to see acquisitions as an important growth driver for WestRock. We have a proven core competency in making good acquisitions and driving fantastic results from them. This is an exciting time for WestRock. I want to thank all of our WestRock co-workers who have worked to achieve all that we've accomplished in the first year.","If you look back, our accomplishments in the first year are significant. We successfully integrated the Companies, both culturally and operationally. We delivered more than $350 million of productivity benefits. We separated Ingevity, completed two acquisitions and formed our partnership with Gondi. That's just a partial list because most importantly, we're building WestRock for the future.","We're investing in developing key commercial and operational capabilities that will support our teams as we build upon our accomplishments. WestRock provides value-added innovative paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win in the marketplace and we deliver attractive and increasing cash flows for our shareholders over the long term.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Staphos","My first question, can you talk a bit about your ability to replicate the productivity performance in consumer in upcoming quarters? Your performance was better than our expectations in the model. What comparative factors may weigh against it or accelerate it? Obviously, you have the maintenance program -- or the maintenance outage of $11 million this coming quarter?","Ward Dickson","As I think of the synergies and performance improvements that we've had in consumer, we have had a lot of the benefits related to the merger occur in the segment and we've done that very quickly. We have had the internalization of the Carolina tons, the internalization of our external folding carton tons and we've done that on the front end of the merger. We will continue to have those benefits. We will continue to have the sourcing benefits that we're seeing across both segments flow through. We will start to achieve some of the synergies that we -- and realize them related to the Cenveo acquisition and the internalization.","We do have the headwinds in the fourth quarter related to the downtime that we will be taking across the consumer mill system. So we're making -- some of the synergies reported to date were front-end loaded related to the internalization, but we're continuing to generate gains across both our converting operations and the mill system.","George Staphos","Okay, so to conclude on that, until you lap this last 12 months, we can continue more or less at this pace, obviously adjusted for whatever volume is going to bring you and also the quarter-to quarter maintenance effects. Would that be fair?","Ward Dickson","That is fair.","George Staphos","Okay. The other thing I had and then I will turn it over, on the Corrugated side, again, you're a bit better than our forecast. Congratulations on that. Can you talk to the degree you think you have still natural ability to move lower on the cost curve across your fleet of mills? Thank you, guys.","Steve Voorhees","Jim?","Jim Porter","I'm great, thank you. George, we have an incredible runway of opportunities in our corrugated mill system to drive value. We've got a big system and you've seen us make changes to our portfolio with the closure of three of our assets and the acquisition of Dublin which has been a reset in our capability to move products around through our system and has improved our free cash flow within the portfolio.","We also have substantial capital investments that are producing fruits. We have a supply chain system that is going through substantial improvement and modification. You've seen that evidenced by the dramatic drop in inventories that we posted this last quarter. So there's a nice runway of projects and our team is highly aligned and driven to create productivity.","George Staphos","Jim, do you think you can move down one quartile?","Jim Porter","That's being a little specific, George. We have -- each mill has its own runway of opportunities and we still have some movement between our assets, but certainly that concept is what drives us.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Weintraub of Buckingham. Your line is now open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. I was hoping if possible to get a bit more color on the comment that you're very encouraged by the business pipeline and noting that, that's a good indicator. One thing that -- a very good quarter, obviously -- one thing, year-over-year volume was still a negative for you in what's been a not a great but an okay environment. How close are we, do you think, to where that volume variable can start being a positive for you?","Steve Voorhees","Mark, on the pipeline, we have a very structured approach build, go-to-market in container. We measure backlogs, we measure pipelines and they have proven to be very reliable indicators of changes in volume over time. I reported I was very encouraged by the business pipeline. That's because we aggregate the potential we have across our system and prioritize it, I feel very good about our ability to grow volume from this point and have showed in the July results.","Mark Weintraub","So you're hoping that, basically, volume can start being a positive, assuming no negative macro developments?","Steve Voorhees","Exactly. It was a positive in July.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And maybe somewhat relatedly, you said you'd shipped 60,000 tons of container board to Gondi in the just ended quarter and they ship 211,000 tons of converted product. How much more are they buying from the outside or is most of the balance there board that is actually made at Gondi?","Jim Porter","Their assets and that marketplace is one that has substantial growth opportunity and partnering with them gives us an incredible pipeline to further integrate with them. They have approximately 500,000 tons worth of manufacturing capability in the fiber-based packaging grades in Mexico and the balance is procured from others. There is local board that is procured, but a big benefit to Gondi is being able to tap into our very high-quality virgin substrates that gives them further capabilities to penetrate in the markets we serve. So net\/net\/net, we see a big opportunity to both improve their capabilities, as well as our vertical integration.","Mark Weintraub","So would it be fair to say a little bit more on the integration from where it is, but then you grow with them. Is that the way to think about it?","Jim Porter","Mark, that is exactly the way to think about it. We can get you the exact number offline.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Phil Ng","Strong quarter. Backlogs in the CNK and CRB was a little bit weaker than I would've expected. You are taking a little maintenance in fourth quarter, but are you planning to take a little economic downtime, as well? I just want to get some clarity on how order patterns are shaking out in that segment in July and August because I've heard that some of the CPG guys have ratcheted back inventory late in the year?","Steve Voorhees","So your question centers on CNK and CRB.","Phil Ng","Yes.","Steve Voorhees","Both of those segments, we'll say, the demand is solid; however, backlogs have retreated somewhat. The beverage business, as we all know, is seasonally strengthening somewhat below prior years, but it's still a solid market for us. Clearly, the craft brewers is a growth segment and so we will, yes, match our supply with demand and that's the landscape in the CNK area. CRB backlogs in the two- to three-week range and certainly it's competitive in the food board segments of the market, but we like our portfolio. We have a very strong customer base and we will succeed in those markets.","Phil Ng","Okay. And a question for Ward, I'm not sure if you prepared to give too much color on 2017, but with input costs rising a bit, some slippage on pricing, offset by synergies and CapEx is looking a little lighter than we baked in. Is that $950 million to $1 billion type free cash flow threshold sustainable when we think about 2017?","Ward Dickson","We're in the early stages of doing our FY17 plan. We're not prepared to give any guidance for 2017. We did give what our ongoing CapEx would be, as we move forward into 2017. We feel really good about the runway that we have related to the performance improvements and synergy targets. We will have inflationary pressures just like the rest of our peers in the segment. We will -- as we put the plan together, though, we also have to assess what we think the opportunities are going to be from a volume and price point of view. So we're not prepared to give 2017 cash flow guidance, but we're piercing through the high end of our range for 2016.","Phil Ng","One last one for me, now that you guys have spun off Ingevity, should we expect buybacks to pick-up? Just want to get your thoughts on what you're seeing on the M&A pipeline side. There obviously been a few box transactions in the marketplace, further integration probably wouldn't be a bad thing for you guys. Just wanted some thoughts in terms of capital deployment the next year or two? Thanks.","Steve Voorhees","Philip, we're going to continue to implement our balanced capital allocation strategy. As far as stock buybacks, we've bought back about $50 million this quarter. That's a $200 million run rate which is in line with where our cash flow generation is. As far as the acquisitions, we continue to look at acquisitions and you should expect us to continue looking at acquisitions and take advantage of the opportunities that we see to improve our business. It's part of our strategy.","Operator","Our next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning, Steve and Ward. First question is on the land sale situation. I know that when Plum Creek did the deal with MeadWestvaco about three years ago, the all-in value of their lands, they implied, were around $530 million. It looks like, if I add this up right, you are expecting $600 million more on top of the $75 million you just got, if I got that right. Is that a fair representation of how much that land value has gone up over those three years? The all-in value might be closer to $700 million or am I -- are there still more lands in addition to the 68,000 acres?","Ward Dickson","That is a tough question for me to look back that far. What I can tell you is, we look back and presented to the Board last week a look-back of the total proceeds of the land and development operation. I found an investor presentation that was done by a MeadWestvaco team in 2011 and they projected what the gross proceeds were going to be across all of their holdings.","We've looked at the sales to-date from 2011 to now and what we think we're going to realize, we're actually on the higher end of the range that they projected back in 2011. So we feel good about the progress. We feel very good about the accelerated monetization strategy that we have and we have confidence that we're going to be able to generate the $600 million in gross proceeds and the $275 million to $300 million of after-tax cash flows to WestRock.","Chip Dillon","Okay. As you -- let's say that you continue to get a little bit better than the stepped-up basis, I would assume that, as each quarter as you sell land and you get some above your basis, you would continue to report that as ongoing earnings, so there could be a little bit of lumpiness like we saw this quarter. Is that something we should expect? Nothing major, but I would imagine it could be to be -- could it be a $10 million or $50 million one quarter, $0 the next?","Ward Dickson","Exactly. Because remember, we valued each project within the portfolio and we feel very confident about the aggregate, that we will exceed the purchase price original purchase price that was done in the merger accounting, but we could have some ups and downs on the individual projects. That will cause some earnings contribution and volatility from quarter-to quarter.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And then just the last question, just on the container board business. Are you happy now, in the sense of where your inventories are now down to or do you feel there is more reduction required? Then looking it around, how do you think about the industry now on the cost perspective? It would seem like, even globally, that we had seen costs basically moving down for the last two, three years, but now it looks like suddenly they are up meaningfully, especially outside the U.S. on the fiber side. And here, not only on the OCC side as well, but on nat gas. Does that change the way you think that the business dynamics look, at least next year or the year after versus what we saw in the past?","Jim Porter","This is Jim. I will take that one. First of all, on our inventories, as I've shared on previous calls, we manage our inventories at a very granular level and the whole purpose of our inventories is to make sure that we're able to provide our customers on time delivery and using the best weight freight. I also said that coming out of our heavy outage period this past couple of quarters, we would be reducing inventories this quarter and that's exactly what we did.","Frankly, from the February peak, we were down 191,000 tons and quarter-over quarter 152,000, so that's a substantial drop in inventories, as we said we would. Where we're currently, we like our position. The logistics network and our supply chain capabilities have improved dramatically.","Railcar availability, truck trade availability leads us to a point where we're pretty pleased with where we're currently. There will always be some pluses and minuses and maybe over time, a small incremental further reduction, so I hope that gives you color on that front. Relative to cost, there's no question that we're facing some headwinds on natural gas and fiber and you have normal inflation. However, we also have a nice pipeline of productivity. So we think, overall, our cost structure in our North American container board mill system is one that we have opportunities to further improve.","The competitiveness globally which I think you were implying is all currency related and certainly we can't control that. So I hope that's germane to your question, Chip.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Mark Wilde","A - Couple of questions. The first one, Steve, you talked about the interest in more acquisitions going forward. I wondered if you could just help give us some thoughts about where we might see that take place. I know there are always questions about, from a regulatory standpoint, how much bigger you could get in the box board business and maybe in the container board business in North America versus, say, doing more things in Latin America or maybe over in Europe or elsewhere?","Steve Voorhees","Sure. We start with looking at acquisitions as we want to do those that improve our business. We do see opportunities in our North American Corrugated and Consumer Packaging businesses. Cenveo was a relatively small transaction. SP Fiber would fit into that. I know you're very familiar with Gondi, Mark. Latin America fits very well with our Company.","We have a great business in Brazil. We would like to invest more in that. We export 60% of our container board to Latin America, so I would say very natural place for us to grow, so that would remain, outside the U.S., the primary focus. We do have strong operations in Europe and Asia and those we would look at, as well, but the opportunity has to fit our business and has to make our business better.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. The following question I had, Steve, was just back in the SBS market. You mentioned specifically that you weren't seeing a lot of pressure from Asia and European SBS. I assumed that, that was coming into the U.S. and I just wondered if you could talk about your export business, because when I look at the trade data so far this year, all the SBS-grades are down pretty sharply?","Steve Voorhees","I am going to let Jim respond to that, Mark.","Jim Porter","As you know, our portfolio of paper board grades is very focused on the premium end of the marketplace, where we're serving the most demanding market segments in tobacco and commercial print, liquid packaging and specialty poly-coated applications. In North America, we compete very well and that's the reason has Steve remarked that we have seen negligible penetration into our markets competing against our premium grades. In the international markets, we use those products in exactly the same way. We have excellent customers in literally all the regions of the world that value our premium substrates and we've seen very consistent demand for those products and we'll see so going forward.","Steve Voorhees","Mark, I would add, when I have gone to Europe and Asia and talked to our sales force, they are incredibly talented at taking the needs of the customer and translating it into the specific quality of paper that they need. It is remarkable to me to see what they do. If you look at the overall volumes that we export, it ends up being a more of a -- it's a differentiated business, but it's more of a niche business because we're taking our technology and talent and just serving the precise needs of our customers. So is on point to our strategy.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Connelly of CLSA. Your line is open.","Scott Liebman","This is Scott Liebman in for Mark. Just a quick question for you. Is WestRock still being as selective in mill reinvestment that it makes on the container board side, similar to RockTenn and how they were? I'm curious as to whether you are selectively reinvestment to strengthen some of the mills but not others has achieved what you wanted thus far? Would you say you are closer to a steady state? Or whether you are still selectively reinvesting with a view to further rationalize the number of mills as one of your big competitors has done pretty successfully in recent years?","Steve Voorhees","We have a very rigorous capital investment process within both our mill and our packaging operations. I don't think it's changed from -- you referenced to RockTenn to the present. I don't think there's been any systemic change. We deploy capital to ensure the safety and environmental strength of each of our assets and then we deploy capital to maintain our assets in a highly efficient way. Most of all, we try to tap into the creative opportunities to make our businesses better. It's a very rigorous process that we would see continuing.","Scott Liebman","And then just one follow-on. When you did the SP Fiber deal, you said you expected significant synergies and for the deal to be accretive in the second half of this year and you've obviously changed the footprint there since the transaction was made. Was that part of the original plan and do you still think that SP will be accretive in the second half? And just overall in that transaction, are you getting the benefits that you expected?","Steve Voorhees","We're getting the benefits we expected. Newberg was not a significant contributor to the overall economics of the transaction. Dublin is the assets that fits very well into our system. We did come up with a -- for Dublin, if you look at the -- say, the productivity improvements that we expected over the first three years, our goal at the time we announced the transaction was $41 million.","We're now, after less than one year, we're at $40 million. So we're not quite at what we achieved, but we're effectively there and then we have line of sight to $46 million and more. We took our Board there last week and the mill looked great. The people looked better. The production is on track. It is a good fit in our system.","We're selling a new product for us in recycled craft bag them and that has worked very well. Our productivity programs are in place and the mill continues to fit very well in our system. So this is -- right now, it has worked out better than we anticipated at the time we announced the transaction.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about market conditions in Brazil. Your box shipments declined in the quarter for you and the industry. Are you seeing any stabilization or maybe improvement there in terms of local demand or do you expect it in the second half? And then, to the extent that you can, can you talk a little bit about the price increase that was announced there?","Ward Dickson","Brazil is, first of all, an incredible asset for us. The forest land, the Tres Barras Mill is state-of-the-art and our integrated packaging portfolio is a great business for us and is performing extremely well. We're all well aware of the political and economic challenges in Brazil and I don't know that I could necessarily predict the trend line going forward on that whole thing, but I would say it will improve over time. I'm just not sure the pace of that.","Relative to our ability to compete, we have superior assets and the quality and capability of both our container board and the products coming out of our converting system are winning in the marketplace. So, as the economy improves, we're going to win. The beauty is, we also have a very low cost mill that is able to toggle between domestic consumption and export, so you've seen our export shipments increase over time. Net\/net, I love our position in Brazil.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. Then following up on that, it seems like there's a lot of local producers there who might be much higher cost and OCC prices have come up pretty sharply there. When you think about rejace's market position within Brazil over this very deep recession, have you been gaining share? Have there been smaller local guys who have dropped out? Any color you can give on the market dynamics there maybe over the last year, 1.5 years?","Steve Voorhees","I don't know that I can speak to our competitors falling out. I just know I love our position. We have a premium virgin product coming out of the state-of-the-art mill that's vertically integrated with a great packaging system and a forest resource that makes us very low cost. So I like our position.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.","Scott Gaffner","Steve, just to go back as a follow-up question on this new business pipeline, has there been any change in the way that you approach the sales team, are we up against easy comps over last year, anything you could talk to about the go-to-market strategy that would have any consequence on that would be great? The only reason I ask is because you go from the minus 2% in the quarter to 1.7% in July. That seems to be a pretty big inflection point?","Steve Voorhees","We worked into the call comments, that over the past year, this fiscal year, our volumes are up slightly. We do not focus on, call it, quarter-to quarter or month-to-month changes in our volumes. I know the investment community does, so we, in turn, have to focus on it, but we're focusing on building a Company that is very profitable and generates long term cash flows. So we're very focused in container, but we have just a very structured way to go to market.","If you come to work at WestRock, you go through a certain training and we go to market and a very consistent way. Then we're in the process of, I'd say, rolling that out broader, more fully across WestRock and we're in a position to do that. I just came across something that Gallup, they have an email that they send out periodically that covers us all sorts of different topics. They sent one out yesterday and their conclusion was they find most companies can double their revenue by simply selling more to the existing customer base. I just repeat that because that's really on point to what we're doing.","Most of our customers will buy folding cartons, they will buy boxes and we're taking our sales force and we're going to market to identify those customers we can go through and add value to. That's a long-winded answer to your question, but I am very pleased with what we're doing.","We're building that capability over the long term. Our volumes will go up or down from quarter-to quarter, but if you look at the overall portfolio of business we're generating, it's a very attractive portfolio of business. I am going to go on because we're supplementing that with capital.","So in Container, we've been very clear about the investment we're doing with respect to the EVOLs. As part of our capital budget process we talked about earlier, we go back and look at all of our capital as to whether it does what we thought it was going to do. At least in Container, as part of this process, we reviewed $80 million in capital projects in our Box business and a lot of them were EVOLs but there were other projects, as well. The actual cost was within 1% of what we thought it was going to be. The actual returns, we estimated at 15% after tax; the actuals were 20%. So they were well in excess of what we thought when we made the investment. So we have, I'll just say, full-court press across our business to go to market in a way which is very for perfect us and then back that up with the investment in capital and talent to make the business -- we will create a lot of value over the long term by doing that.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Just one clarifying point there then. Are you saying that the pipeline looks better maybe year-over-year because you're finding opportunities to go out to Consumer Packaging customers that you didn't have maybe a year ago and sell them some of your Corrugated Packaging? Then I will turn it back over? Thanks.","Steve Voorhees","That's a contributing factor. The answer is yes. It's not the only factor, but it is a contributing factor.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Adam Josephson","Ward, two questions from me. The first is a multi-part question, if you don't mind, on free cash flow. Can you just talk about what the source of the FY16 free cash flow increase was? Was it working capital, CapEx, EBITDA or otherwise? And then -- and can you clarify what, Ward, you are expecting working capital to contribute to free cash this year?","And lastly, with respect to free cash, your initial FY16 free cash guidance was $850 million which included chemicals. Now you are saying, for next year it will be $725 million to $750 million, obviously excluding chemicals. How much of the difference is chemicals versus other? And thank you for all those responses.","Ward Dickson","Adam, I will start with the second one, first. We had capital investments from our specialty chemicals business of approximately $45 million during the period of time that they were part of WestRock prior to the spin, so that is your reference point on the second point. If I go back and I look at the free cash flow guidance that we gave earlier in the year, a lot of things have changed. We've had pricing changes in the marketplace; we have had inflationary pressures. If I were to give you the reference points of why we're going to generate the higher cash flow or come out on the higher end of the range, earnings are better, our working capital source that we talked about at that point in time is actually lower.","The other cash items, such as cash taxes, they are very consistent with the assumption that we laid out back earlier in the year. Then CapEx is clearly on the lower end of the range that we had identified at the beginning of the year. We will even come in just below the $825 million that we had described. So again, it's earnings, working capital is not as big of a use as we described back then, the remaining balance sheet items are fairly consistent and then lower CapEx.","Adam Josephson","Just one on the sequential guidance, I know you called out the $10 million lower income from land, the $11 million of higher outages in consumer, you had higher input costs, you had flat to slightly down price mix. Can you give us any more sense of the magnitude of the sequential decline that you are expecting?","Ward Dickson","We spelled out the two items that add up to $21 million and you can look at our natural gas usage in our recycled fiber and look at the changes in the strips and then the change in OCC. It is pretty straightforward how you calculate that. We do have some residual price mix flow-through from the PPW reductions that took place earlier in the year that does occur in Q4, but we're not giving specific EPS guidance for the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. That you for participating. You may now disconnect.","Matt Tractenberg","Thank you, Nicole. Thank you to our audience for joining us this morning. We're proud of our progress and appreciate your interest in WestRock. If you have questions following the call, investor relations is happy to help you. We can be reached at ir.westrock.com.

My name is Sharon, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock First Quarter Earnings Results Call and announcement of the acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. James Armstrong, Vice President of Investor Relations.","James Armstrong","Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We issued two press releases this morning, one concerning the quarterly results and another announcing our agreement to acquire KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation.","We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during today's conference call. You can find these on the Investor Relations section of our website. With me on today\u2019s call are Steve Voorhees, WestRock's Chief Executive Officer; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Chalovich, our President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. The call today will be an hour long and will end at 9:30 Eastern. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for Q&A.","Before we begin, I'd like to point out that during the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements involving our plans, expectations, estimates and beliefs related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.","Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call. We provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.","So with that said, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks, James. Welcome to our team. I am pleased you have decided to join us at WestRock, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on short notice. ","Before I get into the results of our first fiscal quarter and our agreement to acquire KapStone Paper and Packaging, I want to provide context for what we are doing at WestRock over the long-term.","For those of you who joined us at Investor Day you will recognize this context. First, I believe paper and packaging are very attractive businesses, where scale and differentiation matter. Second, our team at WestRock is building a paper and packaging [leader] with a differentiated strategy and capabilities to generate attractive returns over the long term. And third, margin expansion and capital investment to provide WestRock the opportunity to generate $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA by 2022.","The acquisition of KapStone fits extremely well into this context, and will accelerate the achievement of our near-term and long-term goals. Before I cover the acquisition, I want to cover our first fiscal quarter results that provide a relevant mile marker of progress towards our long-term objectives.","Fiscal 2018 is off to a good start. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 85% and adjusted segment EBITDA increased 33% compared to last year. The results were driven by outstanding performance by our corrugated packaging team. Our adjusted book tax rate for the quarter was 25%. This compares to our guidance of 32% to 33% for an $0.08 per share benefit.","We generated $374 million of adjusted operating cash flow in the seasonally low first fiscal quarter. In addition to strong operating results, we had three items in GAAP earnings that were adjusted out of our $0.87 of adjusted EPS. These items include first, a one-time tax benefit of tax benefit of $1.1 billion as a result of the reduction of our US corporate tax rate. Second, a charge of $180 million on a pre-tax basis to reflect potential future cash payments from our decision to exit a multiemployer pension plan. The majority of this liability is payable over a 20 year period. And third, $28 million of impairments in our land and development business, which were largely tied to reduced values for natural gas mineral rates.","Sales for the quarter were $3.89 billion. This was a 13% increase over the prior year quarter. Total company adjusted segment EBITDA was up $164 million to $654 million, and adjusted segment EBITDA margins increased 260 basis points to 16.8%. This was driven largely by favorable price and mix.","The corrugated packaging segment delivered outstanding results delivered by the full realization of previously published PPW domestic price increases, along with better export pricing, strong demand and favorable channel mix. Corrugated packaging adjusted segment EBITDA margins were 20.4% and were up 510 basis points year-over-year.","Supply and demand fundamentals within our North American corrugated packaging business continued to be strong. We earned a 21.4 adjusted segment EBITDA margin in our North American corrugated packaging business in this quarter. This was a 560 basis point increase over last year. Our fiscal first-quarter North American daily box shipments increased 4% on a per day basis from the prior year period, and January shipments are also up approximately 4% year-over-year. ","The demand environment for consumer packaging is stable. We delivered volume growth across several of our targeted end-markets, including food packaging, healthcare and personal care. These gains were offset by softness in North America mainstream beer, carbonated soft drinks and commercial print applications. Sales increased 17% and segment EBITDA increased 9% driven by the net impact from the MPS acquisition and the sale of our dispensing business.","Backlogs across our mill systems were firm. SBS and CNK system backlogs are currently about five weeks and CRV backlogs are over two weeks with strong order inflow. ","I'll now turn the call over now to Ward to provide more details on the quarter and guidance. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thanks, Steve. As you know, executing our synergy and performance improvement goals is key to achieving our long-term objectives. We exited the December quarter at an annual run rate of $910 million and expect to achieve the billion dollar goal by the end of the third fiscal quarter. ","Before I discuss second-quarter guidance, let us start with the positive impact of tax reform. WestRock recognized a one-time benefit in the quarter of approximately $1.1 billion. This benefit reflected the remeasurement of the company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as the recognition of the tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation associated with foreign cash and earnings.","With our September fiscal year we will receive nine months of benefit of the federal rate reduction in fiscal 2018, and expect our adjusted book tax rate to be approximately 27% this year, and approximately 26% in fiscal 2019. In the second fiscal quarter, we expect the combination of volume, price and mix to be positive in the range of $50 million to $60 million sequentially. Transportation costs are being negatively impacted by winter weather, higher diesel costs and truck and rail shortages driven by strong economic conditions.","The winter weather is also driving virgin fiber costs higher by 2% to 3%. During the second fiscal quarter we expect moderate inflation in OCC prices. In total we expect total commodity inflation of $40 million to $45 million pre-tax. Winter weather may have an additional $15 million to $20 million sequential impact. To help you with your models, we have provided additional guidance on our tax rate and D&A.","When all of these items are taken into account, we expect Q2 adjusted earnings per share to be slightly lower on a sequential basis, but significantly higher than last year's second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.54. We are reaffirming our previous sales and EBITDA guidance and raising our full year adjusted operating cash flow guidance to $2.45 billion due to a $150 million benefit from tax reform.","I will turn it back over to you, Steve.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks Ward. I'm pleased to be able to announce that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire KapStone Paper and Packaging. Before I get too far, I want to express my admiration for Roger Stone and Matt Kaplan and the entire KapStone team for what they have built since 2005.","It is an incredible story. I have been able to spend more time than ever with Roger and Matt over the past few months, and it has only increased my regard for them as people and as businessmen. They are truly focused on their customers and their employees. They have delivered outstanding returns for investors.","It has now been three years since we formed WestRock, and our team has been building a leading paper and packaging company. KapStone is an outstanding fit with our business. The corrugated packaging operations will enhance WestRock\u2019s North American corrugated packaging business and provide complementary products in geographical locations that will enable us to better serve customers across our system.","The addition of the specialty and paper products to WestRock\u2019s portfolio further expands our comprehensive range of differentiated products into heavyweight [craft] grades that we currently do not produce. With the transaction, we also acquired Victory Packaging, a packaging solutions distribution company with more than 60 facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Victory provides opportunities for WestRock to integrate our system further downstream to an expanded set of customers.","I'm looking forward to welcoming KapStone employees to WestRock to provide them opportunities to sustain and advance their careers, and I'm looking forward to working with them to help make WestRock an even more successful company. We have a track record of successfully generating efficiency and productivity that increase performance and create value.","The acquisition of KapStone is no exception as we expect, approximately $200 million in synergy and performance improvements, over half of which we think will be achieved within a year of closing. Combined with WestRock\u2019s current business, we believe the transaction will generate significant cash, enabling us to return to our targeted leverage ratio of 2.25 to 2.5 times in fiscal 2019, while continuing to invest in our core business. We believe the economics of the transaction are compelling.","WestRock will pay $35 per share for a total enterprise value of $4.9 billion. The purchase price equates to less than 10 times KapStone\u2019s annualized EBITDA performance over the past six months, an attractive seven times after anticipated cost synergies and productivity improvements. Importantly, the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to adjusted earnings and cash flow. We expect the transaction to close in the quarter ending September 30, 2018. ","Let us turn to the structure of the transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, KapStone stockholders will receive $35 per share in cash. KapStone stockholders will have an option to elect to receive 0.4981 shares of WestRock stock in lieu of cash. This election will in aggregate be limited to 25% of the total consideration. This option gives KapStone stockholders the opportunity to participate in the future upside that the combined business on a tax-deferred basis.","KapStone\u2019s chairman, Roger Stone, and president and CEO, Matt Kaplan, have entered into voting agreements to vote their shares in support of the transaction. We will fund the transaction through committed acquisition financing and existing liquidity.","The combined company will have even greater capability to serve an expanded set of customers. On a combined basis, WestRock will generate nearly $20 billion in annual sales, produce over 16 million tons of paper and be a leader in the growing consumer and corrugated packaging segments with increased diversification across paper and packaging products, markets and substrates. ","KapStone will be integrated into our corrugated packaging segment, which will represent almost two-thirds of our overall business. The transaction is an excellent strategic fit for WestRock. First, the acquisition of KapStone will create opportunities for approximately $200 million in cost synergies and performance improvements. We do our homework upfront. We have a strong track record of delivering on our commitments across many transactions.","Second, the acquisition strengthens WestRock\u2019s presence in the West Coast. KapStone will help us to better compete in the growing agricultural markets in the region and will bring our value delivery model to a whole new set of customers. Third, KapStone will broaden WestRock\u2019s portfolio of differentiated paper and packaging solutions with the addition of attractive paper grades and distribution capabilities.","The addition of KapStone\u2019s heavyweight kraft products, which WestRock does not produce, are complementary and will further broaden our enterprisewide offerings enabling us to bring even more value to our current and prospective customers. Fourth, this transaction increases the mix of virgin fiber-based paper in WestRock\u2019s portfolio. KapStone\u2019s 3 million tons of paper is made using 78% virgin and 22% recovered fiber. This will bring WestRock\u2019s overall mix of virgin fiber from 65% to 67% and allow for more flexibility.","Also the combined footprint will give us the ability to serve customers more efficiently. The transaction will enable us to bring our automated packaging solutions through [APS] and Box-On-Demand to the same expanded markets. This will benefit our customers through lower cost, increased sales, reduced risk and it will also help them meet their sustainability goals.","And again, the acquisition will be immediately accretive to our adjusted EPS and cash flow. KapStone will add four mills that complement our current geographic footprint. In addition these mills will provide opportunities to further optimize our mill production and reduce both logistics and variable operating costs. The Longview mill gives us great logistical advantages with its strategic Northwest presence while the other mills integrate well into our existing system. The Charleston, Roanoke Rapids, and Cowpens mills are in great fiber baskets that we know well.","The mills provide us with additional operational flexibility across our larger mill system. KapStone brings a complementary box plant system that enhances our national footprint. This will position WestRock to efficiently serve markets where we did not previously have a local presence and expand service to the Western agricultural market. With this extended geographic reach we believe there will be significant opportunity to realize economies in freight and logistics cost due to the integration of our West Coast box plant system with the Longview mill.","I will turn it back to Ward to talk about some of the financial aspects of the transaction. Ward?","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. We believe the acquisition will create significant sub-cost synergies and performance improvements. We have multiple initiatives to reduce cost across the mill and converting network from both process and capital investments, supply chain optimization and our ability to leverage our scale.","In addition, there will be cost savings from the elimination of dual public company expenses. Finally, we will also be able to quickly integrate additional container board production into Victory\u2019s distribution network.","We estimate total run rate synergies of approximately $200 million with approximately half of the synergies coming within the first 12 months. We have demonstrated that we can integrate acquisitions effectively and have a proven track record of delivering on the synergy and performance improvement goals.","While our near-term capital allocation focus will shift to reducing leverage the transaction will not limit us from continuing to invest in our business. We expect leverage to quickly return to our targeted range by the end of fiscal 2019.","I will turn it back to you Steve to wrap it up.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks Ward. The acquisition of KapStone aligns extremely well with our strategy. The addition of KapStone strengthens our North American corrugated packaging business. It provides meaningful synergy and performance improvement opportunities and it is very attractive financially. The acquisition builds on the positive momentum that we have in our corrugated packaging business that will accelerate our ability to reach our margin improvement objectives and meet our $4 billion adjusted EBITDA goal by 2022.","The acquisition plays to our strengths and makes us a better company over the short and long-term. We remain focused on creating stockholder value. As we said before, we think about creating stockholder value as a three-step process. The first step is starting with the customer to provide a broad portfolio of paper and packaging solutions and we customize for the needs of our customers.","This transaction improves our portfolio of paper and packaging solutions. Second, we execute well. This allows us to generate significant cash. This transaction provides us the opportunity to improve performance and execute well over an expanded corrugated packaging system. Third, with this transaction we are deploying our capital back into our business. The acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging will improve our business, grow our business and generate significant value for customers, employees and stockholders.","James, would you now please give the instructions for opening up the line for Q&A.","James Armstrong","Thank you Steve. [Operator Instructions] Sharon, please open the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. Congratulations. Obviously you have been busy as always. One of the questions \u2013 it is certainly everything strategically, financially looks good, the one question people often have had on KapStone is quality of assets, and therefore longer term capital needs. We are hoping to get your perspective on that question?","Steve Voorhees","Sure. I'm going to let Jeff answer that. He has been over to the mills recently with his team and has had the opportunity to review the operating records and meet with the key management. Jeff?","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning Mark. So, as Steve said, we have been through the mills. Went to the east recently, and have previously been through the Longview mill. So we are familiar with the asset quality, and there is really no surprises from what we have seen. We think from what we have seen we are able to manage those assets, invest appropriately through the mill system, and using performance excellence and capital allocation strategy improve the asset quality, the quality of the paper and we have a track record of being able to do that to take SP Fiber, [indiscernible] assets. We are going into a clear item. We are excited about the opportunity to integrate tons from the West Coast and really work that into our entire system. So we are excited about the opportunity. We plan to capital appropriately and we know how to do that.","Mark Weintraub","And so, Jeff, if you contrast the way their assets look relative to yours, would you say they are comparable, there are areas of clear opportunity to get them up to where yours are, or does it vary from asset to asset, any color you could give?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. It varies from asset to asset, but if you take the Tacoma mill in the West, it is a good mill and well integrated for us, and what we have seen is we think we have the ability to bring the assets quality up to our standards, and we have a clear path that we see to do that.","Mark Weintraub","And one real quick one if I could, just on the containable price increase. Friday, IT announced KapStone also announced our unit position where you can tell us given I believe the guidance you gave on all the multiples et cetera presumably did not include another price increase.","Just wanted to clarify that. I'm sure that's the case. But is there any color you can give us on what's going on contained about pricing?","Ward Dickson","As you know, we can't comment on future pricing. What I can comment on is the strength of our business. Our backlogs are strong, our market, our shipments were up 4%, last quarter 4% in January as Steve already said. Operating rates remain strong. As MPA reported 99% operating rates. Export markets are strong.","So, and the economy, the backdrop of the economy is also strong. So, strong more can strong economy but can't comment on future pricing.","Steve Voorhees","And Mark, multiples we gave were on trailing basis to annualized six months or results.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Good morning and congratulations. First question is did I -- I just want to confirm that the guidance for this year does not include any incremental pricing increases in containerboard. And maybe I missed this but Steve did you say that the 2022 target EBITDA was moved up from the 3.8 because of this spill or maybe I misunderstood that?","Steve Voorhees","No. the target we gave on Investor Day was $4 million, there is no change in that. I mean, what we respond.","Ward Dickson","And our the reaffirmation of our full-year guidance reflects our current view of inflationary items but only assumes pricing for previously published price increases across both our corrugated and consumer business. And so, we are our current view is that we can maintain that EBITDA guidance for the full-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","Steve Voorhees","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","Just following-up on Mark's question on asset quality. I think for a number of years you've had a goal of increasing your Ford integration rate. I think KapStone had a kind of a lower integration rate.","Just wondering, in terms of timeline for reaching I think the 80% target that you've laid out, how the acquisition potentially impacts that?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi Anthony, good morning, it's Jeff. We finished this quarter at 77% integration with the KapStone acquisition. We'll be in the low-to-mid 70 still. The integration targets' not a hard and fast number, as we said we'll continue to drive to the 80%. And that's really again the option now that we continue to address the tails of our channels and we like the optionality we have between the channels.","And we will continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Good morning, everybody. Welcome, James. Good luck with the transaction. Thanks for all the details. My question is a little bit of a two-part question. In total, Jeff and Steve, what how will maybe you know KapStone impact the way you run the business. Specifically, what key process and systems and data opportunities you would in KapStone, that's obviously been a big piece of the WestRock story over the last number of years.","And then, in that regard and in terms of how you evaluate business and run your business, does the potential KapStone acquisition change at all, how you'd look at the algorithm for pricing at containerboard, not trying to get into future pricing but if the market and all the other things that go into the algorithm are as they are, would KapStone affect that all your choices for future pricing? Thank you.","Jeff Chalovich","Hi George, this is Jeff. To start with your first question, the way we run the business is the same. We're at much different corrugated business today than when we acquired some more from Stone. The KapStone assets fit nicely into the regions that we already have established.","So, our management teams have come through the Smurfit acquisition, they've done multiple integrations. Their operating platform is a mixture of QIWI and Ametek. Those are the systems we run. We'll fully implement the QIWI system through the plans that we same thing we did in the Smurfit assets. We have a good way to do that, a good data management system.","Our performance excellence programs, commercial excellence programs be rolled out through the plans the same way we do. In the regions as they fit today, East Central in West regions. So, we have the management teams in the areas already set up. We have to scale to integrate these quickly and integrate them well.","And a very good training program with technical resources to be able to implement the systems and processes. So, we won't change the way we go to market and the way we manage the business. And the acquisition also provides a great growth area for us where we don\u2019t compete in some of the local markets in the West.","So, we like the mix of business that's really regional and local. And it gives us some scale on the West where we don\u2019t currently compete and puts us in the new markets. It also gives us some opportunity to scale our automation platform.","So, our \"Box on Demand\" recent acquisition on our APS programs, we really have a new area in markets to be able to leverage that platform which will continue to do in the Northwest, their AG platform is very solid. So, that gives us a chance to integrate our machinery business through the markets.","And then, there is good synergies where we have complementary markets in areas that we need to be able to grow that we were capacity constrained. These assets give us a tremendous opportunity to grow where we haven\u2019t with the systems and processes we already have in place.","On the second point. I'm going to comment, it's been a long time. So, I can't really speak to algorithms and the pricing and make forward comments on the pricing. I know you want to get into the pricing discussion, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Adam Josephson","Hey Ward, John, congratulations and best of luck on the transaction. Steve, one question comparing these assets and this business to Smurfit. How would you compare the quality of the assets of KapStone to Smurfit as well as how you expect the integration to be similar or different? Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","That is a totally different situation. If we recall, I mean, Rock-Tenn at the time was a $3 billion company and Smurfit took us to $10 billion. And it, I'll just tell you it was a challenge to take all that on and we did it. And if you recall that frankly retain the Smurfit management team for about a year.","And then we changed management teams in the corrugated packaging business to the current management team which is led by Jeff Chalovich and Tom Stigers and I think a very talented group of people. And over the past five or six years, I think they have very deliberately developed a just an outstanding business.","We have installed QIWI virtually across the entire system. We have installed a new management system that allow us to manage the processes. And so, in that context, I think Jeff went through how KapStone fits into our business and where they really fits very snugly into our business.","So, the integration challenges, the asset quality challenges, and all of the challenges are much easier to address than Smurfit. I think it's just two different situations.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly from Stephens. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly","Steve, the containerboard now are going to be more than 2\/3rds of the business. Do you think it's important to continue to expand the consumer to make that more relevant or are you comfortable letting consumer contribution continue to drop?","Steve Voorhees","And so, consumers contributions' the same as it was last week. And on consumer we've got a great business which is very complementary to our entire business. And we're going to continue to look at opportunities across our entire business. Part of the reason for the merger was to create long-term opportunities for us to invest and then build our business.","And that remains as true today, last week.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Chercover from Davidson. Your line is open.","Steven Chercover","Thanks, good morning everyone. First, it seems like Victory was an opportunity to place boxes for KapStone but their geographic fit and maybe their financial effects inevitably didn\u2019t allow them to really leverage it. Does your footprint allow you to fill that really rapidly?","Steve Voorhees","It does, I'll let Jeff expand on that.","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Steve. And you have a good question. It does. We're a supplier currently to Victory. We have been for over 20 years, we know their business well. And it's a chance for us to forward integrate across the larger platform. When we had the plants in the same areas, I think KapStone was a little bit of a disadvantage for their plant locations.","We will quickly integrate business across the platform for Victory.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations.","Steve Voorhees","Thank you.","Scott Gaffner","My question was just is really strictly around the timing of the acquisition and sort of what drove the decision making process sort of what line out, because if I look at it, right, it's a 35% premium to last night\u2019s close but 60% premium to where the stock traded over the last seven months of 2017.","So, was there some strategic push that made it now that the best time or maybe you can help us out with that a little bit? Thanks.","Steve Voorhees","Thanks for the question. I've been really visiting and so we announced the merger three years ago. We spun off in jeopardy, we sold HHB and made a handful of acquisitions last year, including MPS.","I'm sorry, think just now is a good time from that standpoint. I think corrugated packaging business has been improving and specifically our corrugated packaging business has been improving. I think we have the capability to take those on in a way organizationally that we just didn\u2019t have even six months or a year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lars Kjellberg from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Lars Kjellberg","Thank you. Just a question on capital allocation. Ward, you mentioned that the focus will shift towards deleveraging. How should we put that into context of this one position and if you can put any color on the incremental CapEx need required to capture those 200 million in synergies.","And if you take delaying any that the major CapEx projects to be able to capture this 200 million versus the prior scenario?","Ward Dickson","Thanks, Lars. I believe this fits quite well into our capital allocation priorities. So, depending upon the timing of the close, our initial leverage will be above three times. But with the ongoing cash flow generation of both our business and the KapStone business and the achievement of the initial synergies, we believe that we will fall back into our targeted range by the end of fiscal 2019.","The capital that we are planning is roughly a $140 million to a $150 million a year CapEx. That's their base CapEx plus any return generating capital that we need to include to capture the synergies. And we will, as we said, we will focus our short-term capital allocation priorities to return leverage in our targeted range but it will not prevent us from proceeding on the strategic capital projects that we've already announced.","And it's a testament to the strong cash flow generation that we have across our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Wilde","Good morning. I think you guys are pretty familiar with that long view mill. You spend a lot of talk over time about potentially leveraging a lot of excess kind of holding capacity of that mill. Can you just talk about the potential for that and whether these recent changes and the tax code might make that more attractive over the next few years?","Jeff Chalovich","Hey Mark, good morning, it's Jeff. So, we are familiar with the mill. I think it's too early to say what we'll do with the assets completely. We're familiar with the capacity for the pulping. It's not, I don\u2019t think it's a simple change. But it's too early to say categorically what the opportunity is there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Security. Your line is open.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations on this accomplishment. Quite significant, I think it'd be quite helpful. A couple, one question for every couple of parts to you. First, can you talk to us a little bit about expectations through the first half of the year or how you see some OCC stuff playing out in the market?","And then, the second part was by our math, if we continue to grow at and you talked about 4% in the first half of the year, I'm sorry, 4% through January for corrugated. The market can be pretty tight and it seems to us as coming into this being a large export player, that's going to have to get throttled back quite a bit.","How do you balance that at least through the first half of the year between pulling back into next board and you still think you'll have enough to serve some of your strategic customers down, example Mexico and that kind of stuff?","Jeff Chalovich","Sure. Hey Chris, this is Jeff. So, I'll start with the OCC. As you probably read, there has been 1.1 million licenses issued recently. So, it's we see it's been down a bit and if you look at our forecast hasn\u2019t changed considerably. There'll be tons hitting China here in the future.","So, it's early to call what will happen with the quality requirements still at 0.5% and the license is being issued. So, we're not clear that it's going to stay so good through the first half of the year.","On the second part, tell me your second part of the question again, please, go on.","Steve Voorhees","It was on the export.","Jeff Chalovich","The export. So, we have pulled packaging now as we continue to manage the tails of our business. We are supplying our strategic customers. And again, we have optionality to the tails. So, if we have opportunities in domestic, we'll export that seem better than the box channel.","We'll take those opportunities and we've done that. So, we'll continue to service our strategic customers and we'll continue to manage the tails. Where we can make the most money on our products, we'll sell them into those channels.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire","And thank you. And my congratulations on the deal. And welcome James to the team. Just a question on the synergies. The target there, it looks like it's a little over 6% of KapStone sales. Actually a little bit high based on some of the recent deals you've done. Just, I know you guys have done your homework on it but just wondering what gives you some confidence that you can exceed a little bit of a higher synergy target than you have on some of the prior yield.","Ward Dickson","This is Ward. I think Jeff has articulated how it just fits extremely well into our network. So, a large component of the synergies is our ability to optimize the supply chain and improve the pairings between mills and external customers and box plans and external customers and our internal supply chain.","We also have seen that we have opportunities to leverage WestRock's scale from procurement point-of-view. Fiber procurement and other commodity procurement. So, this deal, every deal is unique in terms of its complementary nature to our existing network and this fits so well into our both our mill and converting systems that it gives us tremendous confidence that we can achieve the targets.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Hi, just a quick one to finish up. Thanks for taking my follow-on. I just want to verify the synergy targets that you provided both the end goal of 200 million including performance improvements and the half by the end of fiscal '19. Those are run-rate targets, correct?","And then, as we look at the slices of the pie, and I think its slide 18. Can you give us a little bit more color in terms of what you're doing on the mill side, both in terms of the process improvement and network optimization as well as the performance improvements? Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","George, I'll take the first piece of that and then I'll have Jeff add to it. So, it is run rate, run the $200 million goal is a run-rate goal and the achievement of half of it in the first full fiscal year, is again our root run-rate goal. I'll reiterate some of the comments that I just made about the ability to for us to optimize the supply chain to reduce logistics cost as we match mills and box plans with customer pairings and optimize the supply chain and to the straight logistics.","I'll have Jeff talk about the further opportunities in the mill and converting network.","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, George. So, the blue part of the charts are made up of fiber procurement opportunities. So, optimizing fiber purchasing. Energy cost improvements across the system. There's a large opportunity to implement our ePay and maintenance system. So, we see great opportunities across the mill system to do that.","General productivity improvements to our Lean Six Sigma technicians and then also some CapEx related projects that we see opportunities for. So, that's the major part of that, slice of the pi.","Steve Voorhees","So George, I'm on a --.","George Staphos","Thank you.","Steve Voorhees","So George, it's just one of the great things about Smurfit is their system was there most of them was relatively complex from a papermaking standpoint including trauma mixed delays. And so, we took it on ourselves to invest in technology that allows us to dispatch our mill system in an extremely efficient way.","And we've been able to use that to pro forma the KapStone mill system. That gives us a lot of confidence in the, I'm going to say the word \"Justifiable supply chain integration\" and that portion of these synergies and the forms and bring them.","George Staphos","Thank you, very much. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question that comes from Paul Quinn from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Paul Quinn","Thanks very much and congratulations, I like the fit. Just a question on we talked about containerboard, we talked about Victory, just on kraft paper, KapStone has got about a million tons. How do you like that business and especially around the export market and what are you going to do different than KapStone's in there?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi Paul, it's Jeff. So, we do like that business, it's complementary to what we have. So, the heavier weight Multiwall and also kraft bag puts us in to markets where we don\u2019t have. And with the kraft bag market, in favor as you look at plastics being banned, we think that's a good opportunity for us.","And so, we're going to, we'll learn more and more about it as we get into it certainly, since we're just signed last night. But overall we like that market in that segment. And it's complementary to a one we already have.","Paul Quinn","Excellent. Thanks a lot.","Jeff Chalovich","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Gaffner","Taking a follow-up. Just two quick ones. One, on the synergies. When I look at the number, actually looks relatively conservative to me because if I look back just when you did Smurfit-stone, you significantly overachieved your initial goal and even the initial goal was as a percentage of revenue was higher than what you've outlined here.","So, can you maybe talk about your view on conservatism verses aggressiveness on the synergies? And then just, one thing that hasn\u2019t been hid on here on the call is just the regulatory hurdles. Can you talk about any approval that you might need outside of the U.S. thanks.","Steve Voorhees","Okay. So, just we have $200 million, that's the number we're presenting. And we'll comment on whether it's conservative or not after we have $200 million. We think it's a great opportunity, we have complementary businesses. With respect to regulatory clearance and addition to the U.S. we'll need it in Mexico, Austria and Germany.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Wilde","I'm just curious, KapStone has had a pretty bumpy last four five quarters. They seem to have done a whole lot better based on the guidance this morning in the fourth calendar quarter. But what gives you guy's confidence that these issues are really behind them at this point?","Ward Dickson","Hi, Mark. Aside from what we've seen the past that they've laid out, is solid. I think they have been executing better and what I have comprehended is our ability to manage that system based on our history and our results of running the business.","So, what I'm confident of mostly is our management team and how we can execute and how this fits well into our system in the upside we have with managing the KapStone system.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Thanks for taking my follow-up. This is more for Ward. What kind of step-up would be a good number to use? I know Smurfit, I'm sorry, KapStone's DD&A was around 180. And with 220 bigger place to go and just a cut to the chase, it seems like if we assume about a 4% interest rate and that so right depreciation, I'm getting like $0.25 accretion without synergies and $0.85 with synergy.","Ward Dickson","As we get closer to the close with there are -- they're run rated as you said of DD&A's about between a $185 million and a $190 million. We estimated right now that it's going to be our initial estimates a $100 million higher than that.","Chip Dillon","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Security. Your line is open.","Chris Manuel","Good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. First to go back to the OCC environment. What you had an old assumption at your Analyst Day and the primary service it was about 140, 150. What is the new assumption for this year? And then I'd have a second follow-up.","Ward Dickson","This is Ward. What we did provide was a 140 average for the full-year and right now our current estimate is approximately $10 below that for the full-year.","Chris Manuel","Okay. So, that's is what's based in the rest of your guidance. That's perfect, thank you. And then in the second follow-up. The follow-up question is with regards to the KapStone transaction, walk us through a little bit of the process here. So, is there do you anticipate any regulatory issues maybe with a look at mills on the West Coast, since there is a little bit concentration and that type of stuff.","Is there any sort of a provision that either you can walk if there are material divestitures or things to that nature. What's the or can anything there you can tell us would be helpful.","Steve Voorhees","And we'll be making a regulatory filings shortly. We don\u2019t believe the transaction rates is any serious concerns and add the jurisdictions for which we need to receive regulatory clearance. Like our businesses are very complementary, owing that enhances our presence on the West Coast and the heavy weight kraft paper products.","They produce the products that we don\u2019t produce. And importantly, the acquisition will expand and improve the efficiencies of our mill and box plant system and we quantify that with the $200 million and cost synergies and performs improvements.","Chris Manuel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Steve, just one on your grade mix. So, obviously with the Mead merger, you got much bigger in box board and you got bigger yet in box board last year with multi-packaging. And now you're going back toward containerboard is getting into kraft paper to a significant extent.","So, is there any kind of strategic comparative to be bigger in one particular grade and if so, why?","Steve Voorhees","There's not a strategic imperative be bigger in one particular grade. We're a paper and packaging company and I think the a lot of people look at the business between consumer and corrugated. But algorithm is highly related and complementary and one enhances the other.","We have many customers that buy both from a manufacturing standpoint. Paper mill doesn't much certainly know what grades its making. It take fiber and turn into paper and our converting process have great commonality as well. So, IPO is also a paper and packaging company and will continue to look at opportunities across our business, across our grades as we've been doing for the past several years.","Adam Josephson","Nice, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. I just wanted to make sure on the tax rate for KapStone, is there any reason why we wouldn\u2019t be expecting to see similar types of decline versus what's been seen historically as to what you've laid out for yourself from 10% or 11% decline in the effective tax rate. Is that a good starting point?","Ward Dickson","I will let KapStone publish their disclosure for the end of the year to clarify that for you. But the clearly their business even as compares to ours has a higher U.S. mix. So, in terms of earnings mix across the globe. So, they will clearly have meaningful benefits with the rate production -- the several rate production.","Mark Weintraub","Great, thank you.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions.","Jeff Chalovich","Thank you, Sherrin. And thank you to our audience for your time this morning. We appreciate your interest in WestRock. If you have any questions following this call, the Investor Relations team is happy to help you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the WestRock Company special announcements and second quarter fiscal year 2017 results call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Tractenberg, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Matt Tractenberg","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning for the call. We've issued a press release this morning and posted the accompany slide presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website. They can be accessed at ir.westrock.com or via a link on the right side of the application you are using to view this webcast.","With me on today's call are WestRock's Chief Executive Officer, Steve Voorhees; Ward Dickson, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Porter, President of Business Development in Latin America; Jeff Chalovich, President of Corrugated Packaging; and Bob Feeser, President of our Consumer Packaging segment. Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer period.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that during to the course of today's call we will make forward-looking statements involving our finance, expectations, estimates and believes related to future events. These statements may involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we discuss during the call. We describe these risks and uncertainties in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and our 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.","Additionally, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. We've provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Appendix of the slide presentation. The slide presentation is available on our website.","So with that said, I'll turn it over to you. Steve?","Steven Voorhees","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. WestRock had a very good quarter. We generated $0.54 of adjusted earnings per share. We executed well. We delivered year-over-year productivity improvements of $103 million. Our productivity improvements were a highlight of the quarter and were the primary contributor helping us mostly offset the exceptional increase we experienced in input cost. While these higher input cost may persist favorable market trends and the relentless execution of our strategy by the WestRock team will drive improved results and increased value for our customers and stockholders' over the short and long-term.","For a comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions is helping our customers meet their goals from quality paperboard to innovative and functional design to consumer packaging to corrugated packaging to displays. WestRock provides the full range of solutions to our customers. We are successful integrating our products and services to deliver value to our customers. Here are some examples of how we're doing this. We've already closed on more than $150 million an incremental annual sales from the breadth of our portfolio.","Examples of these incremental sales include customers who already buy corrugated packaging from us and have decided to use WestRock to manufacture their folding cartons. This combination provides the opportunity for WestRock to work with these customers to reduce their total cost by optimizing the total fiber required to package and deliver their products.","We have folding carton customers who have decided to use WestRock to design, manufacture and assemble displays and in the process this combination provides the opportunity for us to help integrate the best aspects of both products to help grow our customer's sales. Craft breweries are another excellent example. WestRock can provide craft brew customers with the beverage carrier, the corrugated box and the machinery to assemble the packaging, reducing their cost, supporting their growth, and reducing their supply chain risk as compared to relying on multiple suppliers.","We are extending our solid track record of execution. At the end of the March quarter, we achieve an annual run rate of $675 million in synergies and performance improvements were two-thirds of the way to $1 billion goal. Since the completion of the merger, we've seen $632 million flow through our income statement.","We have line of sight to achieve the $1 billion productivity goal by the end of the June quarter of 2018. This is one quarter sooner them initially planned and highlights the strong performance culture we are building at WestRock. We continue to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We bought back $25 million of stock during the quarter.","Since the merger, we've purchased 15.3 million shares at an average price of $49 per share. In total, we've returned $1.4 billion to stockholders since the merger through dividends and share repurchases. Since forming WestRock, we focused our portfolio on our core paper and packaging business. We excited the specialty chemicals business with the spin of Ingevity. We completed the sale with the Home, Health & Beauty business and monetized a significant portion of our land and development assets.","Over the same time, we've improved our portfolio. We acquired SP Fiber and we acquired Cenveo Packaging. We further developed our position in Mexico with our joint venture with Grupo Gondi, and this quarter we acquired Star Pizza which has expanded our presence in the growing market for custom short-run pizza boxes.","The announced acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions will expand our presence in healthcare and high-end customer markets. The shareholders in Multi Packaging Solutions overwhelmingly approve the transaction and have both held earlier this month and we are progressing well in our integration planning. We anticipate that we will close this transaction in the June quarter. We are excited about the opportunities we are seeing to add new capabilities for short-run and premium products and services to our platform and to integrate in even broader portfolio of solutions across our exciting business.","The work we've done today is confirming MPS was outstanding strategic fit in the WestRock portfolio. After we complete the Multi Packaging Solutions acquisition, our portfolio will be balanced between consumer and corrugated packaging. This balance will provide WestRock the access and the opportunity to participate in a wide range of end markets and the ability to partner with customers across our entire portfolio.","More than 80% of our business will be in North America. About $800 million of our sales will be to Central and South American markets. Another $1.2 billion will be in the European markets and yet another $0.5 billion will be to the Asia Pacific markets. The scale in foreign markets has and will provide us additional opportunities to create efficient supply chains to support our customers' growth across these markets.","Now, let's turn to the details of our second quarter performance. Sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $547 million for consolidated margin of 15%. Total commodity inflation was $125 million headwind year-over-year. This was the result of significant increases across most of our input costs including a $75 million or $66 per ton increase in the cost of recovered fiber and a $23 million or $1.23 per MMBtu increased in the cost of natural gas.","On a percentage basis, our cost of recovered fiber increased by 81% and the cost of natural gas increased by 59%. The corrugated packaging team executed well in the quarter and included the benefits of the $40 per ton price increase published in October as well as increased volumes and productivity gains. These benefits were offset by the previous year's PPW published price reductions and significant inflation. North American corrugated second shipments were up 76,000 tons a total of 3.7% compared to the same quarter of last year.","Box shipments per day increased 1.1% as compared to last year with strength in consumer, eCommerce, and select food markets. The corrugated segment continues to focus on our differentiated strategy and growth in the segments and markets where we can best position ourselves to drive value for our customers and for WestRock. Over the coming months, we will be integrating the 25,000 annual tons containerboard converted by Star Pizza.","Last fall's $40 per ton domestic containerboard price increase that we communicated to our customers has been fully implemented, so we are now at a full run rate. Currently, we are in the process of implementing our $50 per ton domestic price increase that we announced to our customers in March and was recognized in Pulp & Paper Week this past Friday night.","Healthy demand in our export markets continues in part driven by the strong South American growing season both sequentially and year-over-year. Export pricing in March was up significantly from our low point of last year with increases in effect in all of the markets. We fulfilled all backlog export orders from the fall in early winter. Remember, that Hurricane Matthew disrupted our ability to fulfill export demand in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 effectively pushing that volume into the March quarter.","We are currently shipping at a more nominal run rate of approximately 300,000 tons per quarter. North American adjusted EBITDA margins were 15.9%. Commodity inflation was $91 million. We achieved productivity improvements of $36 million as compared to the year-ago period.","This prevalence is the direct result of our entire organizations focused on performance excellence that is supported by our continuing capital investments to improve our integrated corrugated packaging system. We managed our inventory as well with inventories declining by 148,000 tons from last year. We took 78,000 tons of maintenance downtime in the quarter in line with our expectations and we took no containerboard economic downtime.","Our joint venture with Grupo Gondi is progressing very well. Gondi reported sales of $192 million and EBITDA margins in excess of 20%. The Mexican packaging markets remain attractive and the business is very well positioned. In fact, additional investments are in process that will enable Gondi to continue to meet the needs of its customers well into the future.","Our Brazil team continued to perform well with 16.5% total growth in box shipments, up more than triple that of the industry. We have an outstanding business and team in Brazil and see the potential to make incremental investments in this area that can provide attractive growth in returns.","During the quarter, we recorded $2.8 million of legal reserves, which unfavorably impacted our EBITDA margins at 270 basis points. Our corrugated customers are seeking to meet their growing demand for greater performance and more high-end packaging that appeals to today's consumers.","We're partnering with our customers to innovate in the space, create packaging solutions that protect our products and enhanced our brands. We have and will continue to invest in our corrugated platform to meet our customers changing needs and improve our cost position. This work will enable us to generate strong cash flows and improve our margins in our corrugated segment.","The Consumer Packaging team operated extremely well and generated excellent results. Adjusted EBITDA was $235 million or 15.1% of revenue, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Shipments of paperboard and converted products increased 0.9%, driven by growth in foodservice, liquid packaging and folding carton. This was offset by weaker beverage volume.","Revenue declined year-over-year as a result of lower pulp volume and last year's published PPW price reductions. We expect this pricing trend to slow and then reverse for us as we implement price increases across every grade.","Our SBS backlogs improved in the quarter and are currently a healthy six weeks, driven by demand and foodservice and liquid packaging. CNK backlogs also improved in the quarter and are now at six weeks. CRB backlogs are now at two weeks, which is our normal operating level.","Consumer Packaging generated outstanding productivity, $72 million in the March quarter. We operated extremely well by implementing a broad range of improvement projects across the segment, which include ongoing converting footprint optimization, sourcing and capital investments.","We continue to benefit from the integration of the volume we brought into the system from the acquisition of the Carolina product line, the Cenveo Packaging acquisition and internalization of the volume from the merger. The merger has also provided WestRock the opportunity to market our innovative paperboard products through our existing folding carton network. These innovative products include a paperboard called EnShield.","EnShield has been designed for applications, such as frozen food and foodservice where the customer needs an excellent grease barrier without the use of poly coatings. By eliminating the use of poly coatings the package is fully recyclable, which enables our customers to meet their sustainability objectives. Several of our customers are successfully using this product and we are growing interest in EnShield throughout our customer base.","Ward, I'll turn it over to you.","Ward Dickson","Thank you, Steve. Our strategy to monetize the land portfolio is proceeding well and as planned. I'm very pleased by our most recent sale of large portions of Nexton, the largest project in the portfolio. The sales resulted in more than $75 million in after-tax cash flow for WestRock, which drove segment income of $18 million for the quarter, due to our accelerated monetization strategy in accordance with GAAP, we are required to mark down the book value on any projects for the expected sales proceeds are less than book value. Therefore we wrote down the book value on a few projects by $42.7 million, before our joint venture partner share of $6.4 million.","In addition because of the real estate assets now meat the gap held for sale criteria. We have reclassified the caring values to current assets on our March 31 balance sheet. We expect the other properties to have sales proceeds in excess of book value and continue to believe we will achieve the previously mentioned range of $275 million to $300 million and net after tax proceeds. We continue to expect cash flow for fiscal 2017 to be between $150 million and $175 million from our land and development monetization efforts.","We delivered $103 million in productivity and synergy improvements in the quarter and now expect to exceed an $800 million run rate by the end of the fiscal year. We believe that the $1 billion target will be reached by the end of the June quarter of fiscal 2018 which Steve mentioned earlier. We also continue to execute well on our disciplined capital allocation strategy.","During the quarter we returned more than $125 million to our stockholders through both dividends and our share repurchase program. As mentioned on our previous earnings call we expect pro-forma leverage hosting Multi Packaging Solutions transaction and including synergies to be slightly above 2.5 times. We have strong opportunities to invest in our business and in M&A. We expect to allocate more capital into these growth and margin improvement opportunities then to share repurchases over the near-term.","We expect to achieve our current target of $1.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2017. There been numerous changes in the external environment since we provided the guidance at the beginning of the year. We've had significant increases in inflation particularly recycled fiber, but we are also operating in a more favorable pricing environment and generating more productivity.","In addition our land sales acceleration efforts are contributing more cash flow this year. Maintaining the $1.2 billion guidance in adjusted free cash flow is a testament to the strength of our business model, as well as our ability to executed stay on plan. For the third quarter we expect sequential adjusted earnings per share - per diluted share higher than the $0.54 achieved in the second quarter.","For purposes of modeling we provided the key sequential drivers that will impact the quarter. First, we will benefit in the range of $50 million to $70 million of EBITDA from price seasonally higher volumes, favorable mix, and productivity. Second, inflationary pressures from recycled fiber impacted a significantly more than we expected in the March quarter. While prices have moderated recently they remain elevated both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.","Based on our regional consumption mix a recycled fiber index cost was $118 per ton in January, $140 per ton in February, $181 per ton in March for a quarterly average of $146 per ton. Our price per ton declined in April to $168. We expect that recycled fiber costs will moderate slightly from here, but anticipate the average price in the June quarter to be higher than the March quarter.","Third, we've completed the sale of our Home Health & Beauty business in early April and as a result we will forgo approximately $27 million of EBITDA in the June quarter. We do not anticipate meaningful EBITDA contribution from our land and development segment in the third quarter.","Please note that our guidance does not include any potential contributions or earnings or adjusted free cash flow from the Multi Packaging Solutions acquisition since the closing date is uncertain.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.","Steven Voorhees","Thanks Ward. We've made substantial progress over the past two years focusing our portfolio and growing a leader in paper and packaging. We are well positioned to improve our margins, grow our cash and help our customers to achieve their goals for our comprehensive portfolio the paper and packaging solutions combined with our strong execution. We will use our consistent and growing cash flow to reimbursement our business and make acquisitions that improve our business.","We expect to return capital to stockholders by increasing our dividend over time and repurchasing shares. I believe this is a formula that will provide significant opportunities for WestRock employees, customers and investors over the short-term and long-term.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Matt, we are ready for questions.","Matt Tractenberg","Thank you, Steve. As a reminder to our audience, please limit your questions to one, with a follow-up if needed. We will get to as many as time allows. Chris, can we take our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning.","Brian Maguire","Steve, we've seen really strong box shipment volume so far in the last six months, it seems like the industry has maybe entered into a new period of little bit faster growth than we've been at over the last couple years. Just wondering if you have any views on what's really been driving that, I think people have kind of speculated eCommerce, but just wondering if there are some other factors like a stronger industrial economy maybe a little bit better fruit and vegetable demand expected this summer just as you kind of talk to your customers, just wondered what you're seeing out there and how sustainable you think these trends really are?","Steven Voorhees","Brian I appreciate the question. Jeff Chalovich is close to that, so I'm going to let Jeff respond.","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Brian. I think some of the things you outlined in the markets to include eCommerce, some of the fresh and convenient trends in the marketplace we're helping. We have seen in our business an uptick in industrial in the last couple years, actually it's come back some back on onshore has helped our business, so there is a bit more of industrial coming back and then the consumer non-durables although it's straight a little bit from it, the eCommerce piece I believe is helping that and driving some of the growth that you are seeing in the market.","Brian Maguire","Okay, great. And with that as a backdrop just wondering how the rollout of the box price increases going, I recognized you got the $50 from receipt and a lot of the contracts are linked to that, but just as you're having conversations with folks and if there's any volume not linked to that, how is the box price increase being received?","Ward Dickson","The reception is the same as most of the increases I've experienced. We expect the implementation of the $50 that we've announced to flow through the same way the $40, so we'll have some benefit in this quarter. And then by September, we should be at a full run rate on the $50.","Brian Maguire","Okay, great. Just one last one if I would, just on the outlook for the third quarter, just wanted to be clear on the guidance there the $0.54 based in this quarter that excluded about $0.04 of land sales and so as we're thinking about bridging from the $0.54 to whatever it is in 3Q, we don't need to deduct anything for land sales there right?","Ward Dickson","That's correct. The contribution land for the contribution of EBITDA and free cash flow is included, but it's excluded from EPS.","Brian Maguire","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. My two questions are just further delving into trends you are seeing in the fiscal third quarter so far. Number one, can you comment at all Jeff or team in terms of what trends you're seeing early in the quarter, markets that maybe are developing in line are better than expected perhaps those it might not be.","And then the second related question and recognizing this is a little bit like asking Ms. Lincoln how the play was. If you exclude the effect of inflation which has been significantly more than we are you would have expected several months ago and you looked at what your expectations were for this portion of the year. How are you trending? How are you mapping against that again in terms of the fiscal third quarter whether it would be volume, clearly pricing is better, anything you care to share there? Thank you, guys.","Steven Voorhees","George, I'm going to let Jeff handle the first question and let Ward handle the second part of the question.","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, George.","George Staphos","Hey, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning. So far April is shaping up to be strong, there is two less shipping days, but on a per day basis we are up 4.2% through the first half of the month. The segments that we are seeing, we are seeing our agriculture in Northern California come back, the weather start to dry up.","That's been an outage for the last couple months, but we're seeing that come back as weather dries and I think overall that segment will be good long-term because they have water now. eCommerce continues to be strong for us and then some of our consumer markets and some of the food, our markets are still strong for us. I don't really see any trending office unexpected, but those markets particularly stick out as strong.","Ward Dickson","George, this is Ward. First our capital Q2 and how we performed relative to our expectations in the quarter. Clearly as we walked into the quarter, we did not anticipate the pace of the increase in OCC in the quarter. So inflation was probably $25 million higher than what the expectation was as we enter the quarter.","But that was offset by the stronger corrugated volumes that we had, better pricing in mix across both businesses and our mill operations particularly in consumer that you saw from the productivity that we generate in the quarter. They performed extremely well, so our productivity was at a pace that was higher than we expected. And then clearly we also had an additional month of HH&B in the quarter as compared to our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.","Now as I go on to Q3 and Q4, and look at the full fiscal year, the ability for us to maintain the full-year free cash flow guidance. I think shouldn't be lost given the inflationary environment that we're in. So we guided input cost inflation for the full-year at the beginning of the year to approach $200 million.","If you look at the pace of where we are through the first half and then compare that for the full-year that input cost inflation can be close to $350 million for the full-year and what we've been able to do is offset that with more favorable pricing, stronger volumes, stronger productivity and the accelerated monetization efforts that we have in land and development.","George Staphos","Okay. Listen, I have exceeded my allotted question, I just want to say the performance in consumer productivity was very good. Congratulations of that. Thanks, I'll turn it over.","Steven Voorhees","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Chris Manuel","Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. Just two quick questions, first, there was quite a bit of premium attached OCC, your different elements of that nature. Could you give us a sense maybe of how your recycle business did? Where you how planning of those components or not? And then my follow-up question as do some of the boxboard basis.","Steven Voorhees","Our recycling business that the - I guess the primary goal to recycling business is to make sure we have high quality fiber to - for a mills. We do operate a couple dozen plants. We do have a very well developed brokerage operation and they operated extremely successful and they were able to fiber mills and I think to - they also market waste from our converting operations. So they just had a - I think they performed up standard way well during the quarter.","Chris Manuel","Okay, then my second question had to do with some of the various possible grades; it looks like on the longer cycle grade, there was some price published over the weekend as well. What's your outlook for getting some more there? Are you done with your efforts? Is it just more of a staggered thing going through and then can you talk a little bit about the recycle grade as well or your outlook for recovering some of the higher deposit costs?","Robert Feeser","Hi, Chris, this is Bob Feeser. I'll just make a couple of comments on that so. As you know we have made an announcement about an SBS and a CUK increase and we're in the market working with our customers to move our prices up and we fully anticipate that we will get those price increases through and then as you also know we also announced a second CRB increase, which we are in the market as well. We have fully reflected in our forecast the CRB that increase that was reflected in pulp and paper week.","Chris Manuel","Thank you, guys.","Steven Voorhees","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Debbie Jones from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Debbie Jones","Hi, good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning, Debbie.","Debbie Jones","I was wondering if you could talk a little about the comments you made the strategy to potentially grow in Brazil where are the opportunities that you are seeing is it mostly on the converting side where I imagine you would get significant synergies or are you open to mill systems as well and kind of a sense of how urgent this is for you?","Steven Voorhees","Okay. Let me Jim Porter leads our Brazil operations now, so now like Jim respond to that question.","James Porter","Good morning, Debbie. First of all we really love our Brazil business the management team in that region are doing an outstanding job and continuing to execute a very strong manner. What we have some of the best timberland on the planet very new virgin containerboard machine and the trace box mill and a nice packaging system that's focused on innovative solutions. So they're performing very well. So our macro view of that business is to invest in it and we would see it being complimentary to expand our packaging and our know system capability. So we are not here was specificity but we are engaged in developing projects in that region.","Debbie Jones","Can you give us a sense of that the opportunity in the region for M&A, is there a pipeline?","James Porter","We really don't speak on our pipeline, but we are considering investments in our existing businesses our primary focus, but we are open to M&A that could merge with that business but it's not our primary focus.","Debbie Jones","Okay thanks. And then just my follow-up question, just can echoing whatever and that the consumer business is quite strong. I am assuming that that productivity performance is what's driving the comments around exceeding these 100 million by year-end? Could you just begin to kind of what went better than expected this quarter and what's driving the increased in the $800 million targets?","Robert Feeser","Debbie, this is Bob Feeser. We delivered strong productivity with buy and large so in line with our expectations. The mills ran extremely well for the quarter and we're continuing to see really strong yield from our base productivity program, which is many hundreds of projects across the system. We're continuing to capitalize on merger benefits and we'll be lapping those benefits in the coming quarters and I would mention that our beverage and displace business. We saw very strong productivity in those businesses with the fixed cost actions that we've taken as well as converting footprint optimization projects.","Ward Dickson","Debbie, this is Ward. I would just reiterate our goal along has been to when asked if we would raise the $1 billion productivity target it was to achieve the productivity target faster. So although the performance is very strong in the consumer business and Bob is talking about many of the merger related benefits of the internalization of the 250,000 tons that we talked about in the past we've also are making improvements also in our corrugated business and as well as the corporate functions as well that had merger related synergies So it's across the whole company that gives us the confidence that we're going to be able to exceed the $800 million run rate exiting the year and then actually pull in the full - the timing of the $4 billion goal by a quarter.","Debbie Jones","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. I turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Mark Weintraub","Just one clarification first half. It also in the bridge from the current quarter to the coming quarter, you noted that the negative $27 million from the sale of Home Health & Beauty. I think you maybe had backed that about $10 million or so from the EPS result pretax. So in thinking bridge should be thinking more like a minus 17 as we do an EBITDA bridge from this quarter to the current quarter?","Steven Voorhees","What we showed you was the EBITDA that remember when we recorded the held for sale we did not depreciate. We had lower depreciation in the quarter is normally the D&A in that business was about $3 to $3.5 million a month. So there was also the benefit in the in Q2 which we backed out of adjusted EPS held for sale impact on the lower D&A. So the sequential improvement from an EPS point of view would have reflected not only that we don't have the EBITDA contribution, but then you don't have that benefit that you have from the lower D&A. EPS is the net of the two.","Mark Weintraub","Got it. And you really did do phenomenally well in the consumer packaging relative to what I've been anticipating and productivity was a big part of it. Also that the pricing and mix held up much better than what I had anticipated given what we've seen in paper week during the prior year. Is that a function just of timing of when things roll through or have we really seen the majority of the negative downward drift and in fact we start to begin to see some of the positive price action begin to run through the P&L, how should we think about that?","Robert Feeser","Yes. Mark, this is Feeser again. So, yes we did see some positive mix underlying the business and really driven by some positive trends that we're seeing in liquid packaging and food service as well as growth in the healthcare and beauty markets as well. So that's positive mix, but we still have more of the announced price for the reflected PPW price to flow through in the next quarter before we start to see the trend back up with the price announcements that we've made.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. And then lastly on MPS, can you update us on expectation of closing for the transaction?","Ward Dickson","We still need a couple of regulatory approvals. We anticipate getting those over the next couple months, so we anticipate closing during this quarter.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Ward.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","I wondered if we could kind of coming back to consumer packaging in these productivity gains, is it possible that you can just help us parse out the key elements with a little more detail?","Steven Voorhees","Sure. Again the biggest individual driver that contributes to the acceleration of productivity on a year-over-year basis has been the internalization efforts that we've had since the merger. As we move into the second half of this fiscal year as Bob said, we are lapping those benefits. So it's the integration of the Carolina tons, the integration of the Legacy RockTenn folding carton tons, the integration of the Cenveo tons. Those are large contributors to the benefits.","We've had procurement savings like we do across the whole system. And we also have footprint actions that we have been talking about both in our beverage business. We've actually took some footprint actions in our displays business as well, so it's a combination of all of those. I think on a year-over-year basis, as we look at this fiscal year, I would anticipate that this quarter would be the peak quarter in terms of productivity on a year-over-year basis because we do start to lap the benefits of the internalization efforts that really hit full speed as we went into the second half of fiscal 2016.","Mark Wilde","Okay. On those internalization, I mean some of that we understand is kind of bleach board that you are selling on the outside going into cartons, but is some of it also perhaps where you'd maybe been running some rolled pulp at the bleach board mills, and so you're actually not running rolled pulp, you are back running bleach board and you're able to internalize it?","Robert Feeser","Yes. Mark, this is Bob Feeser. That's exactly it. As we manage our system, the big opportunity from the integration of those tons was to upgrade the mix and eliminate the production of pulp in the system and integrate these tons, so that's exactly it.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And Bob just for my kind of closing, can you just do the same thing with box board in the cartons that we've talked about with kind of containerboard in the boxes in terms of timing, because I recall it back in the MeadWestvaco days moving those bleach board hikes through with some of the customers in tobacco or whatever, usually took quite a while. And I think there's some of the same that occurs in the CNK business?","Robert Feeser","Yes, those dynamics are similar I would say in the boxboard markets compared to containerboard that there is certainly a lag and we've typically would peg that it roughly about nine months from the time of a board increase through passthrough on boxes.","Mark Wilde","Okay, that's helpful. Good luck in the quarter.","Steven Voorhees","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Adam Josephson","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Josephson","Steve, just one question on eCommerce and one on OCC, I don't know how to direct this to Jeff or Steve. You mentioned a positive impact on your box demand in the quarter and continuing in April, I don't think that it's surprise anyone, can you talk about also the impact on availability and price of recycle fiber as a result of the growth in eCommerce and as well as whatever price mix impact this eCommerce growth is having on your business?","Steven Voorhees","Sure, I'm going to let Jeff to handle that.","Jeff Chalovich","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Josephson","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Chalovich","On the recycle piece, there is some uptick of OCC or corrugated going to our single stream recycling centers. So we operate those centers and it's a few percentage points. So it has some effect, but I would say it's not a driving effect at this point in time on driving OCC prices as eCommerce becomes bigger, it may have a bigger effect right now it's very minimal.","The mix of that business varies. If you look at our system some of the investments in EVOLs, die cutters. The things we've done in the system, we're setting up our systems to run the complete mix of the eCommerce space. So you have small RSCs wraps, die cut wraps that we're putting machines and to be able to handle those mailers, [T-folders,] we're equipped very well across our system with scale to address the complete mix of the eCommerce space.","We're also seeing more graphics, which we can use the photos of products. So websites are a little laminate, manufacturer in our merchandise displays or footprint we're able to address that space across our entire enterprise. I won't speak to the margins, but the mix I think we're well positioned to address.","Adam Josephson","Thanks, Jeff. And Ward, just want to know OCC. I know you mentioned you expect slightly lower OCC cost sequentially. Can you help us with what decline you're expecting in May whether it's $15 a ton or otherwise and related what if any impact you think decline in OCC in May would have on your ability to raise box prices and CRB prices? Thank you very much.","Ward Dickson","So the guidance that we gave on inflation is largely the range is due to OCC. So what I would say is that our expected average for the quarter is up between $10 and $15 a ton. So that would imply some slight moderation from the April level and then we just really carried out through the end of the fiscal year without any real sequential decline from Q3 to Q4.","We believe that the environment to execute that containerboard price increase is strong and in fact we've reflected it in our free cash flow guidance and underlying demand operating rates. Inventory levels support the implementation of the price increase both - in all three of our channels because we are also implementing price increases into the export channel as well. And so we feel good about the outlook and we've reflected that in our free cash flow guidance for the full-year.","Adam Josephson","Thanks a lot Ward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng","Hey, guys. Question for Ward. In your 3Q guidance, do you have any incremental pricing benefit from the April increase or exports flowing through? Reason why I ask you that I would have thought the open market tons from April increase would have provided a larger list, but can you remind us the cadence on how the timing works to PPW reflected in April? Do you start seeing the open market increase in May? Just some color around that.","Ward Dickson","Okay. So the prices mix volume and productivity where we've identified at $50 million to $70 million sequential improvement. The biggest individual driver of that is price.","Philip Ng","Okay.","Ward Dickson","We will get sequential price increases because of the export price increases that we announced recently and are implementing. We will start to get the initial benefits in our domestic containerboard channel and in boxes well and as Jeff said the implementation will be very consistent with the implementation of the $40 per ton increase and by the time we exit the fourth fiscal quarter we anticipate that we will be would be a full run rate.","Philip Ng","Okay. That's helpful. And then one more question for you Ward. From a cash flow standpoint I know you excluded MPS [you have encoded]. Can you provide some color on contribution you think it's going to have for this year and in land sales you guys are able to monetize it well quicker this year so that the big left on cash flow for 2017 but how should we think about the lumpy for 2018?","Ward Dickson","Let me start with the second question. So I will give a buildup of how we get to the $300 million of the land accelerated monetization efforts. We started the clock on that in Q4 of FY2016 and we had about $10 million that was contributed. If we achieve the $175 that means that we will have about between $100 and $150 million to go in fiscal 2018 and that's our current plan. Now I forgot you gave me two questions I forgot the second question?","Philip Ng","The MPS do you say know the deal has been closed but any color on the contribution on cash flow but actually the share?","Steven Voorhees","What I would look at is I would just refer you to their historical public filings and look at their unleveled free cash flow generation. We will have more details when we actually closed the transaction and then have a forecast of how it's embedded and along with our integration plans, but at this point I would point you to their historical public filings.","Philip Ng","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Dillon","First question have to do just making sure we understand the tax rate in the last quarter. It depends on I guess the non-controlling interest bill. It looks like it was pretty high on operations like 38% but in Ward if you could clarify that. And then secondly, I'm not sure if you all actually had any land sales cash in 2016 so is that mean you have about $125 million left in 2018 if you hit the $150 to $175 target?","Ward Dickson","So Chip I just answered your second question and the last question. We did $10 million in Q4 FY2016 so of land sales. So it's approximately $115 million that would be required next year to get to the high end of the range. If I would point you on the adjusted - the tax rate for adjusted EPS was just over 34% current quarter. The best thing for you to do is to go to the press release the last page in the press release have all the adjustments and the associated tax related to those adjustments and then you can bridge back to the 34%.","Chip Dillon","Yes, well, I just it wasn't clear how the non-controlling 6.4% was treated but I see what you're doing here? So is that makes sense.","Ward Dickson","Yes, and so our guidance going forward is still 34%, our cash tax rate for the full-year will approach 38%.","Chip Dillon","And then just real quickly more for Steve, as you think about the MeadWestvaco acquisition? Have you found any ways to benefit cross segments from that and what I mean particular what OCC spiking like it has - has it and thinking about the first quarter being seasonally slow for CNK? Is there any way you can sort of bridge that in any way whereby you know maybe you actually are better off as a company slowing back you know recycle mills and maybe making a little bit of just linerboard at March.","Robert Feeser","Yes, Chip this is Bob Feeser. We are actually integrating if you will March as part of the overall containerboard system and where it makes sense in those offered periods to actually run a little bit of craft linear to do exactly what you indicated. So that's actually a nice positive that we see as part of the overall merger.","Chip Dillon","Understood thank you.","Steven Voorhees","Chip, I just go on from there, when we - the idea of the merger was to build the paper and packaging leader and consumer and corrugated packaging. I go back and look at what we saw it periodically in the time we announce merger and we're just spot on what we intended to do. So we've got leadership positions in the businesses we operate.","We've integrated to outstanding organizations. We're focused on customers who are larger more balanced in our Company. And we have I think a terrific slate of investment opportunities both internally and potentially be acquisition. But just kind of put us in a great position going forward. I just want to add that to your question, since you brought up the merger.","Chip Dillon","Well, I'm not sure I would have ever anticipated when I just asked, but it certainly is clear that's one big positive. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Chercover of Davidson. Your line is open.","Steve Chercover","Thanks. Good morning everyone. First of all, just on Star Pizza was that about a $35 million acquisition and what multiple was paid please?","Steven Voorhees","We haven't put out this specific numbers on that. I think the purchase price here in the zone of what it was and I think we haven't announced a multiple, but it's a very attractive multiple for us particularly when you put in the 20,000 tons of annual containerboard integration. We have as a result.","Steve Chercover","I recognize it small, but still nice to see it integrating. And then I want to get a bit more color on exports if you would. So you've got both a price increase and if I'm not mistaken just a diminishing discount, so can you give us a sense of what the mill nets or how they might be changing year-over-year?","Steven Voorhees","I'm sorry, what are changing? I didn't hear with you.","Steve Chercover","I guess I'm calling it mill nets because I think you've got both an explicit price hike, but also the discount in the export is getting smaller. So I'm wondering how much more you're actually capturing in the export market per ton?","Ward Dickson","Well, we've increased significantly from the low point exports and the markets are strong that we're serving. It's a good market for us and I'd say that from a low point we have significant increases that we're putting through right now.","Steve Chercover","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari","Hi, good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","On the free cash flow guidance, I was wondering if it's possible that quantify the expected impact working capital, I think you said it was maybe a $70 million source of cash earlier in the year, has that changed?","Ward Dickson","Anthony, this is Ward. It has not changed materially.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just going back to export containerboard, is it possible, but qualify the export price increases that you're currently implementing that maybe aren't looks like that and kind of the latest pulp and paper week? Are they kind of on the order of magnitude of $30 a ton, $50 a ton, any kind of color you can give us across the major market you ship to?","Ward Dickson","As I said Anthony, we are in the process of implementing. I think part of the drag was we had the 33,000 tons in the quarter that we moved over that sort of diminish the flow through some of the pricing. But we're in the midst right now of the increase and we are moving to significantly in those markets.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Gaffner","Hi good morning.","Steven Voorhees","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Jeff, quick question on the volumes within the corrugated segment, you were up 1% this quarter and the industry up - was up about 2% and I think you were slightly below the industry in the prior quarter as well. But you mentioned maybe some end market exposure like Ag and maybe there's some geography there. Is there anything specific to point to as to the underperformance relative to the industry and maybe we start to recover that as we move into the back half of the year based on your exposure?","Jeff Chalovich","Hi, Scott. So I think there's a lot of dynamics that effect volume overall in the short-term. There has been some weather things there's lots of things that happen in the markets that affect short-term. Over time we were serving markets in segments and we believe we can add value to our customers and to our business in a differentiated strategy and I am fully expect that over the term - the long-term which we have shown over the long-term we can grow at the market and beyond.","Scott Gaffner","Okay and we see announced that they were putting on hold their recycled fiber recycled containerboard index. For a while, but they are also exploring a more objective calculation methodology for pricing on a go forward basis any initial thoughts on what that would do as far as volatility in pricing for containerboard?","Robert Feeser","I mean it's too early to tell I don't know enough about the performance space yet my position as we think the current index works well it's a good indication of movement and we prefer that we keep the same baseline that we have now, but I don't know enough to say what it will do in the future.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. But last one for Ward just on you mentioned the $70 million positive working capital, but you have $150 million of in additional raw materials headwind. So where is the from a working capital perspective where is the variance relative to that that gets you still that $70 million positive.","Ward Dickson","So that's a point over time - that's the inflation's over the course of the whole year and the working capital set up, a point in time at the end of the year what I will say is that we've done a good job of managing inventories and our procurement organizations soon a fantastic job of implementing our supply chain financing program and extending terms with our vendors.","Scott Gaffner","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I return the call to our presenters.","Matt Tractenberg","Okay. Thank you, Chris, and thank you to our audience for joining today's call. As always reach out to us. If you have any questions, we're happy to help. Have a great day everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
