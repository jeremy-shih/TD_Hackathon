At time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Paul Surdez, Vice President-Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","And now turn it over to your host.","Paul Surdez - Vice President, Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's fourth quarter and full year 2015 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet.","With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jay Boyle, CEO of LabCorp Diagnostics, and Deborah Keller, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","In addition to our press release, we also filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we're making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2014 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC, and will be included in our 2015 10-K. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Paul, and good morning. 2015 was a transformative year for LabCorp. We delivered a strong operating performance and created the world's leading healthcare diagnostics company through the acquisition of Covance. We now have employees in approximately 60 countries, generate nearly 20% of our revenue from outside the United States, and are well positioned to compete in a number of attractive global markets. Specifically, our addressable market now extends beyond the roughly $70 billion North American clinical lab industry and includes global opportunities in our core laboratory business, drug development, food safety, and market access. With the Covance acquisition, our company now competes worldwide in a growing addressable market of approximately $200 billion.","Our financial performance in 2015 reflects our larger footprint and broader capabilities. The combined organization delivered strong revenue growth and margin expansion in 2015, with nearly $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income, double-digit earnings growth, and over $720 million in free cash flow. In 2016, we expect our free cash flow to exceed $900 million with attractive opportunities to enhance our market position and create shareholder value through capital deployment.","Our guidance reflects our confidence that LabCorp Diagnostics will deliver another strong year, and that Covance Drug Development will continue its solid momentum into 2016. Our success is due to execution of our strategy to improve health and improve lives. Our execution on three key strategic objectives, delivering world class diagnostics, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster, and changing the way care is provided led to these impressive results, reinforcing our conviction in the transformation that we undertook a year ago with the Covance acquisition. I will discuss each objective and how we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace.","First to deliver world class diagnostics, we focus on organic growth through introducing new tests to our existing customers as well as through reaching new customers, channels, and markets. We also focused on integrating diagnostic information and content and continuing our industry leadership in scientific innovation. Finally through disciplined capital deployment, we acquired complementary businesses that enhance our offerings.","Last year, we expanded our test menu with the introduction of 75 new assays and accelerated next-generation sequencing capabilities. We experienced strong demand for our innovative decision support tools, delivering over 5 million enhanced reports to help customers manage health and important conditions such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. We also added complementary capabilities through targeted tuck-in acquisitions, such as Safe Foods, a premier food safety laboratory that expands our size and reach in the fast-growing global food safety arena.","In addition, we progressed on a number of important consumer facing initiatives, including our Patient Portal, Lab-In-An-Envelope offering, and consumer-initiated testing, and we remain enthusiastic about their long-term impact on our business. Our strength in science is highlighted by our differentiated capabilities and unparalleled experience in companion diagnostics, which provides a sustainable competitive advantage. Over the last six months, three very important oncology companion diagnostics received FDA approval. For each one, we were the exclusive laboratory to partner on the clinical trials and support the regulatory submissions.","In addition, we were among the first labs to launch these tests for commercial distribution. Our ability to collaborate with sponsors at all stages of companion diagnostic development through Covance and commercialization through LabCorp gives us a preferred offering that is improving the lives and health of patients and translating to robust financial growth. Our companion diagnostic franchise achieved double-digit growth in 2015, and we remain confident that we will deliver $100 million in incremental revenue in companion diagnostics through 2018.","For our second objective, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster, we are focused on commercialization of novel technology, helping partners rethink their global R&D decisions and disciplined capital deployment to build and acquire complementary capabilities. We collaborated on 87% of the 45 new drugs that were approved by FDA last year. Within oncology, we collaborated on 100% of the new drugs that were approved.","It is noteworthy that these collaborations included all aspects of our full spectrum of drug development services, from early development to central lab to clinical. These outstanding results demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities and the power of our combined company to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions designed to improve the success of clinical trials, reduce development timelines and consistently deliver the highest quality services at a competitive price point.","Our differentiation extends to our combined central lab, which is recognized as the industry leader in revenue, scale, service, quality and breadth of test menu. During the quarter, this business grew double-digits and secured a multi-year sole-source relationship with a large new customer, bringing great momentum as we move into 2016.","We continue to lead the industry in using patient data to improve trial recruitment. Through the end of 2015, we attribute over $130 million in new orders to our backlog due to the combination of LabCorp patient data and Covance's capabilities. Our success spans multiple indications, including oncology and infectious disease, and includes wins from both new and existing customers.","In the fourth quarter, we began soliciting patient consent to be contacted about potential trials through our Patient Portal. The initial response to our outreach has been excellent, as tens of thousands of patients have already consented, and we expect this database of patients to rapidly grow. This capability is unique and allows us to build a large cohort of potential candidates for clinical trials, Phase IV studies, observational trials, and a host of other real-world applications. It plainly highlights the power of our data and our combined entity.","For our third objective, to change the way care is provided, we are focused on commercializing our innovative technology-enabled solutions. We are pleased with the initial successes of Beacon LBS and Xcellerate Monitoring. Beacon LBS uses technology to improve decision-making about laboratory test ordering at the point of care and began generating revenue in 2015. Xcellerate Monitoring leverages the power of actionable data to better manage clinical trials. And in 2015, we announced a landmark multi-year agreement to deploy this product as an exclusive central monitoring solution for our customers' worldwide trials. These solutions delivered great value to our partners in 2015, and we expect to expand their capabilities and utilization in 2016.","LabCorp looks very different from a year ago, and we have taken profound steps to transform our company and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. I am deeply appreciative and gratified by the focus, performance and enthusiasm that my 50,000 colleagues around the globe brought to our work throughout the past year. The acquisition of Covance created a unique business with extraordinary capabilities and significant global growth opportunities. Our execution has resulted in impressive and financially measurable progress on our strategy, and I expect this progress to continue in 2016.","Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments, and conclude with our 2016 guidance.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 48% over last year. The acquisition of Covance contributed $670 million during the quarter, driving 44% year-over-year revenue growth. The remainder of the increase was driven by organic volume growth across both core and esoteric testing, as well as benefits from Beacon LBS, price mix, and tuck-in acquisitions that were partially offset by currency.","Gross profit for the quarter was $741 million, or 33% of revenue, compared to $547 million, or 36.1% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to the acquisition of Covance as well as price mix, organic volume, and the benefits of Project LaunchPad, partially offset by personnel costs and currency. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact of Covance. Excluding Covance, gross margin would've increased 10 basis points over last year.","SG&A for the quarter was $405 million, or 18% of revenue, compared to $310 million, or 20.5%, last year. Excluding special charges of $32 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Covance and legal costs, SG&A in the quarter was $373 million, or 16.6% of revenue, a 300 basis point reduction versus last year's adjusted SG&A. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to Covance, personnel costs and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by Project LaunchPad savings. The reduction in SG&A as a percent of revenue benefited from Covance's lower SG&A rate. Excluding Covance, SG&A would've improved 20 basis points over last year.","During the quarter, we recorded $54 million of restructuring charges primarily relating to Covance. Amortization expense for the quarter was $38 million, up from $15 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions. Operating income for the quarter was $244 million, or 10.8% of revenue, compared to $219 million, or 14.5% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring, and special items of $125 million, adjusted operating income was $368 million, or 16.4% of revenue, compared to $250 million, or 16.5% last year. Excluding the mix impact from Covance, adjusted operating margin would've increased 20 basis points over last year.","Interest expense for the quarter was $57 million compared to $32 million last year. The increase was due to higher debt balances due to the acquisition of Covance. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.5%, higher than last year's 36.1% rate due to the taxable nature of certain restructuring charges. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 34.1% compared to 36.5% last year as we benefited from Covance, which has a higher percentage of its earnings generated in lower tax rate foreign jurisdictions.","For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 35.3% and we expect the rate in 2016 to be comparable. As a result, net earnings for the quarter were $114 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared to $120 million, or $1.39 per share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $1.98 in the quarter, up 20% from $1.65 last year.","During the quarter, operating cash flow was $385 million compared to $214 million last year with the increase due to the acquisition of Covance as well as favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $85 million, up from $46 million last year, primarily due to Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $300 million compared to $167 million last year, bringing our full year free cash flow to $727 million. Excluding net nonrecurring acquisition items of approximately $110 million, our full year free cash flow would have been $837 million.","Our cash balance at year-end was $716 million compared to $713 million at the end of the third quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. During the quarter, we invested $43 million in acquisitions, and paid down $250 million of debt, reducing the company's leverage to 3.6 times debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.","Now, I'll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are presented on a pro forma basis for all periods, as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2014, and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses.","During the quarter, we revived our methodology for the calculation of unallocated corporate expenses which impacts our LabCorp Diagnostics segment results and has been applied to prior periods for comparative purposes. As a result, LabCorp Diagnostics' operating expenses increased by $8.5 million in the quarter and would have increased $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Conversely, unallocated corporate expenses were reduced by $8.5 million in the quarter and would have been reduced by $7.6 million in the fourth quarter 2014. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.","Now I will review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 4.3% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, Beacon LBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions partially offset by currency.","The increase in revenue of 4.3% includes the benefit from Beacon LBS of 1.1% and an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.8%. Revenue per requisition increased 2.2%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions.","In addition, esoteric testing revenue grew at a faster rate than core testing revenue. Total volume increased by 1.8%, of which organic volume was 1.6% and acquisition volume was 0.2%.","LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $293 million, or 18.9% of revenue, compared to $273 million, or 18.4%, last year. The increase was primarily due to volume, price mix and productivity, partially offset by personnel costs.","Improvement in productivity was driven by Project LaunchPad, which delivered approximately $20 million of net savings during the quarter, bringing our full year total to $65 million. We remain on track to achieve our three-year $150 million goal and estimate that the remaining LaunchPad savings will be achieved equally over the next two years.","Now, I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $691 million, an increase of 4.7% over last year. The stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 230 basis points. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7% over last year.","In addition, the anticipated expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement on October 31, impacted revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Excluding this item, constant currency revenue would have increased 9% over last year.","Covance Drug Development had strong revenue growth across all of its businesses, led by central lab. In addition, the revenue growth rate in the clinical business improved from the third quarter, as did the rate in early development when excluding the impact from the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement.","Adjusted operating income was $110 million or 16.0% of revenue, compared to $90 million, or 13.6% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to increased demand as well as productivity and cost synergies, partially offset by personnel costs. We captured approximately $15 million of cost synergies during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $45 million. We remain on track to achieve our three-year $100 million goal and estimate that the remaining cost synergies will be achieved equally over the next two years.","Net orders during the quarter were $816 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.18, while backlog at year end was $6.7 billion. The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill was 1.23.","Now, I'll review our 2016 guidance, which assumes January 31 foreign exchange rates for all of 2016. On a consolidated reported basis, we expect net revenue growth of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2015 net revenue of $8.5 billion, after the impact from approximately 100 basis points of negative currency.","We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 3.5% to 5.5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $6.2 billion, after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency.","We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 2% to 5% over 2015 pro forma revenue of $2.6 billion, after the impact from approximately 200 basis points of negative currency.","The expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement will negatively impact Covance's 2016 growth rate by approximately 260 basis points. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, net revenue is expected to increase 6.6% to 9.6%.","Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is $8.45 to $8.85, an increase of 7% to 12% over 2015. We expect the distribution of earnings in 2016 to be similar to 2015 as our results in the first and fourth quarters are typically impacted by inclement weather and holidays. Our adjusted EPS guidance includes the impact of currency and an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and option exercises but does not include any share repurchases.","We expect free cash flow to be between $900 million and $950 million, up from $727 million in 2015, and expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of net revenue, consistent with 2015.","In summary, we are enthusiastic about our prospects for 2016 and expect strong top-line growth and margin improvement to drive strong year-over-year earnings per share growth and robust free cash flow.","This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, and thank you. I just had a couple of quick follow-up questions around your revenue guidance. First, can you maybe break down what your expectations are on the Diagnostics side between volume and price? And Dave, maybe just give us an update as to what you're seeing out in the marketplace as far as commercial reimbursement. We obviously know what's going on with PAMA, but any update around your thoughts on the commercial reimbursement environment?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Lisa. We don't separately break out volume and price in the guidance, so we can't give you any further clarity on that. With respect to commercial reimbursement generally, I think the environment in terms of pricing continues to be relatively stable. We saw nice revenue per requisition improvement year-over-year in the quarter and for the third quarter in a row. And as Glenn identified in his remarks, that's a combination of tests mix and core, esoteric growing faster than core and the benefit of some tuck-in acquisitions that brought us some higher pricing. So generally pleased with the overall pricing and reimbursement environment, and pleased with obviously the improvement in revenue per requisition in the quarter.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then how about on the Covance side? So 2% to 5%, I know last year, Dave, that you announced that at our conference there was something that was signed on the Covance side. Is there any update there? Maybe update us on the revenue synergies and how those are coming along. And then also just help us understand what potentially gets you to the upper end of that revenue guidance range.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So with respect to the revenue synergies, as we indicated on the call, now over $130 million in what we described as category 1 which is the use of the patient data, and I continue to be quite optimistic about that given the success that we've had with the patient recruitment through the Patient Portal. As we mentioned, tens of thousands of patients have already agreed to be re-contacted. It gives us a deep base of patients to \u2013 that we can contact for potential trials, which I think will be a differentiator in terms of winning revenue over time, winning commitments from sponsors over time.","Obviously central labs, very, very strong in the quarter, and very pleased with the growth and the momentum that we have going into the year. And we saw a nice improvement in revenue in the clinical business. We saw, I think we're seeing very good success in our early development solutions. And I would highlight again the companion diagnostics and our success in companion diagnostics.","Nobody else can say that they had \u2013 that they were the exclusive lab on the three key oncology \u2013 immuno-oncology drugs that were approved in the market over the last six months. Nobody else can say they worked on 87% of the drugs that were approved or on 100% of the oncology drugs. It's just something that completely sets us apart from the market. So what gets us to the high-end would be stronger performance in the clinical business, and obviously the mix of business wins, because longer, more complex trials that pay us a longer stream of revenue with a better mix, will lead to more profit, and that will get us to the higher end of the revenue range and obviously help us also approach the higher end of the EPS range. So I said a lot there, but, Deb, if you have anything to add, happy to have you add as well.","Deborah L. Keller - Chief Executive Officer, Covance Drug Development, Covance, Inc.","No, I think, Dave, the point that you made about the wins that we've had because of the clinical data, as well as the strength we've had in central labs, early development continues to do well. With the capacity utilization strong in the U.S. and in China we've got some additional space, in Europe, and we continue to look at innovative ways in which we can be (27:02) comfortable with our space to kind of meet the changing demand in the early development space. And then last but not least, as you mentioned, the mix of studies, whether it's where they are geographically or therapeutically also, can have an impact.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Deb, if I can just ask one follow-up. If we look at what's going on, on the biotech side right now, we think about new companies trying to come to market and obviously this is a difficult market for biotech companies. Are you seeing any impact on these new emerging companies as far as your pipeline goes?","Deborah L. Keller - Chief Executive Officer, Covance Drug Development, Covance, Inc.","Most of our business, 85% of our business comes from the large pharmaceutical companies. And that continues to be strong. As far as biotech, they are a very important part of the drug development process obviously, and somewhat of an innovation engine for pharma. We believe that the cash on hand remains at high levels and we've had nice wins from the biotech industry this year, specifically in our early development, but across all of our segments.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Hey. Yes, thanks. Just a question, you mentioned that you added a large multi-year contract with a new central lab customer. Can you give us a bit more color on that contract? If it's for a specific project? Does it go across projects? Is it an exclusive relationship? And then maybe just what you believe drove the win? Why did they decide to contract with you?","Deborah L. Keller - Chief Executive Officer, Covance Drug Development, Covance, Inc.","Yes. Good morning. Well, first of all, we don't comment on a specific client, but what I will tell you is that it is a multi-year sole source, and what that means is that we'll not only be the sole source provider for the central laboratory, but also for the bio-analytical. It was tough from a competitive standpoint, but how Covance eventually won that sole source was based on our first of all our operational service excellence and our breadth of testing menu as well as our global reach.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Bill, it's Dave. I would comment, it's a new client for us, so that's really a positive development. And also, I think in large measure, it's attributable to the combination of capabilities. I mean, the LabCorp esoteric capabilities, so we start with Covance's global reach and the strong reputation for quality and service. And then add to that, LabCorp esoteric capabilities, the next gen sequencing capabilities, we really present a very compelling value proposition. And as we've gone head-to-head with competitors for these agreements, we've been very pleased that in situations like this we come away with the wins.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. Great. Can I sneak in one follow-up?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, one.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Thank you. Also related to Covance, obviously the revenue side is looking great, the outlook there. Now that you've had Covance sort of under your belt for a year, can you tell us what your latest thoughts are on your initial synergy targets? Whether those are looking more or less conservative? And then whether you see any efficiency opportunities at Covance sort of beyond those initial synergies?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bill, it's Dave. So as we mentioned in the call, we've achieved $45 million of the synergy \u2013 of the $100 million that we initially set out as our target. So I think for year one, that's a very strong performance against the target. And we remain committed to achieving the $100 million, and as Glenn said, approximately 50\/50 over the next two years. Having said that, we always look to outperform on the synergies, and we always look for the opportunity to improve efficiency and productivity, but along with that, just as with Project LaunchPad, to improve the employee and customer experience. So I certainly think there will be opportunities as we progress and particularly as we even more comprehensively integrate the capabilities of the organizations around oncology, for example and around infectious disease to find more savings and we'll obviously keep you closely updated as we move forward.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the details so far.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","So I'll try and keep to my one question here. It might have a couple parts to it, so bear with me. The cash flow generation profile here continues to be robust. Obviously it was as a standalone company, now you're starting to see the benefits from being a pro pharma (32:14) company being able to generate even further cash. As you think about that cash flow generation particularly now as you're getting towards the leverage level which I know, Glenn, you're probably a little more comfortable with.","You contrast against the backdrop of an uncertain market environment for a vast majority of the smaller players in the market given the questions about PAMA, the broad views on utilization, how is that affecting your M&A pipeline? How is that affecting the type of deals that are being presented to you given that you have a very active BD (32:44) portfolio? And how do you think over time that will evolve, particularly if we do move to a situation where the PAMA revisions do not change and a lot of these small labs don't have the capabilities to be able to address what the reimbursement cuts could be?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, good morning. It's Dave. I think obviously the cash flow generation is very impressive. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, over $900 million projected for next year. I think the M&A pipeline right now is as robust as we've ever seen it. Part of that is because we are looking at M&A in other areas where we see the opportunity for fast growth, like the food business with the Safe Foods transaction. But we also \u2013 we see a lot available in the tuck-in opportunities, in the diagnostics space. And we plan to be very disciplined in terms of what we buy and how that fits into our core strategy, which as we've said many times, around diagnostics M&A is expansion of footprint, expansion of test menu, and continuing to build size and scale in the franchise.","So we feel great about the M&A pipeline and we certainly have plans to \u2013 as we've said frequently in the past, our guidance always assumes that we're going to acquire about 1% of rev \u2013 that we're going to do tuck-in acquisitions that will account for about 1% revenue growth and that's certainly in the plan for the year, and I think there is ample opportunity to execute on that.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Nice quarter, guys. I similarly have one question, two parts. Maybe for Dave, just curious what your views are on the volume environment on the lab side of the business. The organic volumes, it looked like it pulled back a little bit, just pairing that against what you're hearing from the hospitals, what your view is for 2015, or for 2016? And then for Glenn, just surprised we're not seeing a little bit more gross margin leverage given the pricing benefit. I was wondering if you could walk us through that, too. Thanks.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jack. It's Dave. So I think what we have said all year long about volume is that we knew that we were going to see a step down in volume from the first half to the second half because of the annualization of the contracts, and obviously we highlighted that. It hasn't been a secret, and that's been the case. I think if you look sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, taking into account the differential in the number of days in the quarter, that volume per day was actually quite consistent. And so we are pleased with the volume and we are pleased with the organic volume growth that we delivered throughout 2015.","For 2016, I think our volume projections, and obviously we've seen some things coming out of the hospitals that suggest that hospital volumes have been bouncing around. But I think our volume projections for 2016 suggest that we would expect to see a continuation of what we've kind of seen here in 3Q and 4Q, absent some large contract winner, some shift in the marketplace; you're going to see volume, organic volume continue to grow at kind of this 1.5% to 2% rate depending on the ups and downs and ins and outs.","So I think we've been obviously delivering very, very solid volume growth and we expect to continue to do so. And in particular, proud of the fact that the great majority of that volume growth is coming from organic growth, which means the introduction of new tests, our sales efforts and our organizational leadership is extremely effective. Glenn?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Jack, I guess just on the leverage in the margins, first we think we obviously had a very strong year on leveraging our top line. Margins overall were up around 110 basis points year-over-year, 47% leverage on the incremental revenues is pretty strong on a pro forma basis.","That improvement in margins was across both gross profit and SG&A. So when we talked about the margin improvement that we had excluding Covance, to show that it was a mix impact, when you look at both segments on a pro forma basis, you actually see both segments seeing very strong margin growth. So we characterize it as a pretty strong year, benefiting from the strong demand, benefiting from price mix, if you will, benefiting from the tuck-ins, benefiting from our LaunchPad initiative, our synergy initiative on the Covance side. So overall we would characterize it as very good leverage.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Two very quick ones. First on the Beacon LBS, just wanted to get your thoughts of kind of the expansion potential of that platform. And then secondly, back to capital allocation, with $900 million plus of free cash flow in 2016 and probably certainly growing in 2017, how do we think about the share repurchase opportunity now that you are, I would assume by the end of 2016 you will be within shouting distance of your kind of approaching 2.5 times leverage target? Thanks.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Nick, it's Dave. On Beacon LBS, the strategy across the enterprise is consistent, right? It's new customers, new channels, new markets. And so for Beacon LBS, the expansion opportunities in 2016 are new markets with the existing customer, which is United, new customers, which are other organizations that may be interested in subscribing to the tool, and new channels, which is the addition of more capabilities such as molecular diagnostics to the menu.","And all those things are underway, and we feel very good about where we are with Beacon LBS. And it's been, this is a service that the Beacon LBS team within LabCorp has really invented, created, designed, and implemented, and I am really proud of them, and they should be really proud of themselves about what they've accomplished, because it's terrific. And it's generating a fairly significant amount of revenue now, and we see the opportunity for great growth there.","On capital allocation, we have said many times that our target leverage is 2.5 times; that is only a target. We are always going to be flexible in terms of looking at how we allocate capital. We do expect that by the second half of the year we will certainly be in a position to consider returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase. And again, it depends on the M&A pipeline, depends on how the cash flow stacks up, but we'll always be evaluating that opportunity.","As you know, I think we've had a pretty consistent history of share repurchase as a way of returning capital and creating value for shareholders.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys. Thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of technology questions actually this morning. First off, I thought it was notable that you went through some commentary on the companion diagnostics opportunity, I think you said $100 million by 2018, and I just want to kind of confirm that you guys were talking about that $100 million as sort of an annual run rate that you look to achieve by that time. And if so, should we assume those revenues are accretive to the EBIT margins for the company?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Isaac, what we said was that we expect it to generate $100 million in incremental revenue for the enterprise by 2018. So we haven't talked about the run rate of the companion diagnostics business specifically other than to say we had double-digit growth in 2015, which we are very pleased with. But we don't want to confuse the $100 million in incremental revenue which was the initial target that we set out a year ago for the companion diagnostic growth with the size of the business, because the size of the business is already actually quite close to that number.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then just maybe from a biotech standpoint, we've \u2013 I think the question has been asked a couple of different ways, but I'm wondering if you could maybe benchmark for us historically when you've seen slowdowns in funding how you guys think about the impact that has on the Covance side? Is there a sort of magnitude of funding slowdown or a timing there that we should keep in mind to the extent that this is a fluid environment for that customer group and the impact on the Covance business? Thank you.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I just go back to what Deb said. I think she covered it quite comprehensively. There's billions of dollars in cash on the balance sheets of biotech, and when there's a good compound that a company is looking at, it doesn't get canceled because of lack of funding. There's always a way to find funding for it. Compounds or studies get canceled because of adverse events or because of a change in focus, but we don't see the \"funding\" environment as having any near-term effect on where we are with Covance at all. And again, as Deb highlighted, 85% of our revenue is coming from what we would characterize as large pharma, so the exposure to biotech is only about 15% of total Covance revenue.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse [sic] (Bank of America). Your line is now open.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, Dave or Glenn, in the 8-K, it looks like you break out Covance at about 31% of your revenues now, but is that including some of the non-government facing business, the non-managed care business as well, the forensics, the substance abuse testing? If not, what could that percentage all-in represent?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, all of, Robert, all the revenue streams that we have obviously flow into the two segments, so everything is encompassed there.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So the non-traditional businesses are 31% then of your revenues?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no, the 31% is the Covance business. The non-traditional \u2013 so the way it sorts out, Bob, is that anything that reports into Diagnostics is reported as part of Diagnostics, so the forensics, the Orchid Cellmark, all that stuff reports in through Diagnostics, and that's part of the \u2013 that's part of what we report as Diagnostics. The only thing that has changed in the way that we have historically reported is what used to be reported as part of LabCorp in the clinical trials business, which was our central lab, has moved over to Covance, and what used to be reported as the Covance Food Safety and Nutritional Chemistry business is now reporting up through LabCorp. And you think of that in approximate terms as we've put a little more into Covance than has come over to Diagnostics, but not materially so.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","(45:06)","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to get at, Dave, when you did the Covance deal, there was a slide I think that you threw out that a certain percentage of your revenues was now away from where maybe the problem was from a reimbursement standpoint, government standpoint, what have you. I'm trying to get at how much of your business now with Covance growing with the Orchid, the Bode deals and the other things. Is it 35% or closer to 40% now that might be away from traditional managed care pressures and maybe government reimbursement challenges?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, just take a first cut, I think maybe what you're getting at is with the acquisition of Covance, we picked up a lot of pharma and biotech customers that we didn't have that now represents, call it around 30% of our total. So by definition, call the government reimbursement side is a lower percentage given we've added new customer base.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we can, I think we actually published a chart that shows those percentages, Bob, and we'll get that up. But my recollection is pure government went from like 17% to 12%, and managed-care went from a little over 50% to about 30%. So say we went from 67%, approximately 67% to approximately 42% in terms of managed-care and government payment across the enterprise. Does that help?","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, I will follow up with you. I've got to go back and find the initial slide. But that is clear. Thank you.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just had a question on the patients database that you spoke to. So I'm wondering at this point how much of a limitation, if at all, the consent issue has been in terms of your ability to mine the data and productize the data side. So in other words, as you build that database, could you see acceleration in bookings as a result of your ability to have the consents there? And at what point does the database have critical mass? I realize it's growing quickly, but at what point does it become sizable enough that it would move the needle?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess there's a lot in that question. So let me start by saying that monetizing the data in and of itself has never been something that has been an aspiration for LabCorp. We don't view data sales as \u2013 it's not going to generate enough revenue to materially help us, and it's not what we want to do strategically. What we want to do is we want to use the data to further the strategy, and the strategy obviously is to execute on our three core goals, which is delivering world class diagnostics, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster, and using technology enabled solutions to change the way the care is delivered.","What I see in getting patient consent through the Patient Portal is, we have patients who come to us for lab testing. They come to the Patient Portal to get their results. When they come to the portal, we are now addressing the patient population in a place that we've never addressed them before and that no one else is addressing them to say, given your diagnosis, given what we know about you, would you be interested in being contacted in the event there was a study that could potentially improve your own health or could improve the health of the population as a whole? And the response has been very positive. And as I say, we launched it in 4Q, tens of thousands of patients have encountered the prompt. A lot have said yes. Some have had said no.","We are working on figuring out how we can improve the yes rate. But, and again, this is not as simple as when you go to download an update to your Apple phone and you either say yes and you get it, or no you don't. There has been a rigorous compliance review, there are protections around how we present this to the patient and what we ask them, and we've gone through a very thorough review to make sure that we're doing this in a way that is going to be protective of the patients' privacy, and our responsibility to honor that.","Now again, what does that lead to? It leads to a large database of patients which can be accessed for a variety of things, clinical studies, Phase IV, observational studies, reaching out to patients to ask them questions about medication use or medication adherence. So just a whole variety of areas in which we think this becomes a differentiating factor because we have the patients' consent to re-contact them. So I would contrast that with an anecdote that was told to me recently, which is a patient got a letter in the mail from a pharmacy saying, since you are taking this drug, would you like to be in this trial? Well, the patient was taking the drug for a completely different reason, and was annoyed by the letter. Because the patient had never given the pharmacy permission to write them letters and ask them about what they want to do because of their use of drugs.","We get the patients' consent beforehand before we ever re-contact them, and we ask for it. And as a result, I think we're going to have a very, a cohort that's going to be very interested in how they might participate. And, sure, in the long run the goal is, that would lead us to more bookings, it would lead us to more opportunity to show sponsors that we have a good patient cohort available when they start recruiting and would lead to more revenue and growth.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You had about $110 million of acquisition or integration costs this year, where do you see that next year and maybe the year after?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, when you say the integration, we have costs from integrating the business as well as primarily relating as well to the Sanofi site support agreement that's now expired, and we are going through a restructuring there. So we still anticipate having integration restructuring costs in 2016, but a much lower level than what we've had this year, and then those ultimately will go away.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then maybe some color on the esoteric growth front? Maybe more detail in terms of where it's coming from specifically? And then how does that break out from, growth from what you're already doing versus acquisitions that you've made?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The biggest areas of growth in esoteric, probably women's health, NIPT, continuing to see good momentum with BRCA, and infectious disease. So those are probably what I would highlight as the four top areas. How much of it is acquisition driven? The acquisition pricing benefit actually mostly came from anatomic pathology as opposed to specific test acquisition. So most of what I would characterize as the core, I'm sorry, the growth in esoteric just came from excellent execution on sales priorities by the organization.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Hi. Good morning. Dave, obviously you talk about tuck-in acquisitions at about 1% to top line, can you maybe share with us your thoughts of M&A opportunities and kind of like your appetite outside of the core lab business?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Good morning, Ricky. So one of the things I highlighted in my opening remarks is that we are competing in a much bigger space than just the core lab business. So now we are competing in the core lab business but on a global basis. We are competing in drug development, we are competing in market access, we are competing in food safety. So you should think about our appetite for acquisitions as spanning all of those businesses, potentially. Now a couple of caveats, the likelihood of us doing a sizable ex U.S. clinical laboratory acquisition is relatively small, just because we are much more likely to think about doing that, doing ex U.S. clinical laboratory now that we have a global footprint by building as opposed to acquiring.","So we certainly are looking at global expansion opportunities in the clinical lab business, but I wouldn't put that at the top of the list from an M&A perspective. What I would put at the top of the list is tuck-in acquisitions in the lab, the clinical lab business, acquisitions in the food business, acquisitions in drug development, acquisitions in market access; all of which we'll look at through the lens of, what's our return on invested capital, how does it strategically contribute to our key priorities, and what are the valuations relative to other opportunities for deployment of capital.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And if I could have just one follow-up, and that might be a question for Deb. Obviously 2015 was really impacted by the fact that new trial startups took longer. I think, Dave, in the past, you said that the period of time for trial startups was extended by around 6 months to 12 months. So can you just give us an update on where you are at now and have we kind of like \u2013 have you normalized kind of like your book of new starts, and is this going to be sort of a headwind to revenue conversion in 2016 and beyond? Or are we now at a steady state?","Deborah L. Keller - Chief Executive Officer, Covance Drug Development, Covance, Inc.","Thank you for the question, Ricky. As far as our backlog burn, we've seen it stabilize. It started off the year, as you said, a little bit slower than expected, however, both in clinical and central labs we saw it stabilize throughout the year, kind of similar to the trend that we've seen in the last 10 years.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. So from your perspective, it's kind of like we're now at kind of like the new normal.","Deborah L. Keller - Chief Executive Officer, Covance Drug Development, Covance, Inc.","It's just leveled off to similar to the trends that we've seen in the last 10 years is how I would state that.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we're at about the top of the hour, we have six more questions in the queue, so I would encourage people to let's try to ask one, and also let's try not to ask things that have already been answered, please. We would like to be able to answer everybody's question today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Just a quick one on bad debt and self-pay collection rates. Have you seen any change or deterioration in co-pays deductibles? Just maybe remind us where that's trending and maybe any opportunities to improve the collection rates going forward. Thanks.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So bad debt improved throughout the year, and the team did a terrific job in terms of both reducing the bad debt rate and recapturing additional revenue that previously was going to bad debt. The issue on self-pay is we're seeing, as you see more patients come through exchanges, exchanges do tend to have higher deductibles, higher self pays, and now we are experiencing something, although in a limited way that you've heard other providers talk about, which is people who are on and off the exchange. So they are on the exchange and then they're off the exchange and then they sign back up again, there are 29 different reasons right now why people can get on an exchange even outside the enrollment period. And so we're seeing some of that, and it does mean that more bills go to patient. So for now we feel like we have the situation well in hand, but it is something that we're keeping a close eye on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Your line is now open.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, everybody. Obviously a lot of territories covered, but let me ask you about Washington if there's any updates either with respect to the CMS clinical lab fee schedule or the FDA and its efforts around lab developed tests, what you're hearing from your Congressional supporters as well as from the administration?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A.J., it's Dave. So on PAMA, we have not heard anything further. Obviously there were some very positive developments from our perspective in terms of strong letters going from the House, from the Senate and from the Chair and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee encouraging both the inclusion of at least a selection of key hospital labs as well as a delay in the implementation of PAMA. We continue to believe that the inclusion of key hospital labs is absolutely vital to accomplish the Congressional purpose, which was a market based price for Medicare, and realistically, we're at the end of February, the rule has not been finalized. It's hard for me to imagine how this could be implemented in January of 2017 in a way that would be fair to our industry. So that's the view on PAMA.","On FDA, we continue to work closely with Congress and attempting to work with the FDA as well on a solution that would be a legislative solution, that would bring clarity to whatever regulation there's going to be of lab developed tests, and it would not be depended on sub regulatory guidance as a proposed long-term solution. And we feel, again, we've been very clear about this, we feel very strongly that guidance is the wrong way to go about this and that we will continue to oppose that path.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Jason Plagman on for Brian. Just a follow-up on the M&A discussion. To get a little more specific on the CRO side, are there any segments or markets that are interesting both either short-term or long-term, how you see the M&A opportunity on the Drug Development business?","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think we have anything to say beyond what we've already said, which is we're going to look at all opportunities and evaluate the strategic fit and the returns and the valuations in comparison to what other opportunities there are.","Jason Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray, Your line is now open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So real quickly, Dave, you mentioned that you introduced 75 new assays in 2015. If we just set aside the legality of what FDA is trying to do on the LDT side, how are you guys thinking about I guess from a preparatory standpoint about introducing new tests in terms of potential FDA regulations that you may have to go through? And then secondly, any impact from the January storms that we need to be thinking about here for the first quarter? Thanks.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","To the first question, Bill, before we introduce a test to the market, and some of these tests are kits which obviously have been approved or cleared by the FDA. But before we introduce a test to market, there is a very robust validation process within our laboratories to make sure that the tests are, that they are valid, that they report what they are supposed to report, and that they have appropriate clinical utilities. So we've followed that path for years, we've been very disciplined about it, and we'll continue to follow that. And again, our exposure to the LDT, the potential of at least the initial stage of what FDA has proposed from an LDT perspective is relatively low as a percentage of revenue. But this is important as an industry matter, and it's important from an overall perspective in terms of innovation and development in the diagnostic industry. For the weather impact from the January storms, I'm going to turn this over to Jay to respond for the Diagnostics business.","James T. Boyle - Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer, LabCorp Diagnostics, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings","Thanks, Dave. Bill, the weather obviously, we are always concerned about weather this time of the year. Fortunately for us, it was comparable to what we experienced last year. I think most of the weather in the areas that would have been impacted was fortunately on the weekend. So at this point we view it as inconsequential, and we are keeping our fingers crossed for the remainder of this first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Real quick, I'm not sure you talked about sort of what appears to be an improving price environment for pre-clinical CRO testing. I know it's a small revenue number, but I assume that's a pretty big drop through, so small lever. But can you just maybe give a tidbit or two on kind of the broader pricing environment there?","Deborah L. Keller - Chief Executive Officer, Covance Drug Development, Covance, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. This Deb. You are right, the demand is increasing, and it has great incremental drop through. What I would say is that we are, where we see the utilization getting tighter with U.S. and China, it is driving some modest price increases in those regions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for the question. You guys have done a very good job growing organic volumes over the last couple of years in a tough environment. This quarter, you put up 150 basis points of organic volumes. I want to make sure I understand what is contributing to the slight deceleration, if you will, on the organic volume trend line? What factors are baking in and how are you thinking about the impact of high deductible health plans and competition from hospitals? Thanks.","David P. King - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I think, as we said, the biggest factor that's contributing is the annualization of the contract wins. And I don't think there is enough going on in high deductible plans or hospital competition to really change that. I think the reality is that the high deductible plans and high co-pays have more of an impact on bad debt and collections. It doesn't stop the patient from coming to get the testing done, it just stops us getting paid for it. So I don't think that has a significant impact on volume.","We've always faced competition from hospitals. I actually think that it's been really about three years since we saw the huge shift in hospitals buying up physician practices and in-sourcing them, and I think we are doing a terrific job on organic volume. I think the Diagnostics team has done a great job. We're clearly outperforming from my perspective, the competitive market with organic volume growth. I think we're outperforming the other healthcare services providers in terms of organic volume growth.","And so in spite of, and again, if you look at that what you'd characterize as a slight deceleration on a per day basis, 3Q over 4Q, it's actually essentially flat from an organic volume perspective. So we are very pleased with it.","Operator","I am showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Dave King for closing remarks.","David P.

My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. David King, Chairman and CEO of LabCorp. And you have the floor, sir.","David P. King","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Conference Call. Joining me today from LabCorp are Brad Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President of Chief Accounting Officer; and Steve Anderson, Vice President, Investor Relations.","This morning, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial results, provide 2012 guidance, update you on our Genzyme Genetics  integration, highlight our progress on our 5-pillar strategy and provide answers to several frequently asked questions. ","I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Anderson, who has a few comments before we begin","Stephen Anderson","Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via the telephone and Internet. Please refer to today's press release for replay information. ","This morning, the company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information. Additionally, we refer you to today's press release, which is available on our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS excluding amortization, free cash flow and adjusted operating income. ","I would also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits of the Genzyme Genetics and other acquisitions.  These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the company's financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2010 10-K and subsequent filings. The company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change. ","Now, Brad Hayes will review our financial results.","William B. Hayes","Thank you, Steve. On today's call, I will review 4 key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. I'll also review our 2012 guidance. ","First, cash flow. Our cash flow remains strong. Excluding the Hunter Lab settlement of $49.5 million, free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $759.4 million. Cash flow has been negatively impacted by approximately $17 million, due to delays in the Genzyme Genetics enrollment process, which we expected and have previously discussed. The impact from these delays has improved by $11 million since the third quarter of 2011, and we expect to continue to make progress in resolving these issues. We remain pleased with our cash collections. DSO was 46 days at the end of December, unchanged year-over-year and sequentially. Our bad debt remained 4.5%.","Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 5.5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Genzyme Genetics accounted for approximately 4.8% of this growth. During the quarter, revenue per requisition increased 4.2% year-over-year. Genzyme Genetics accounted for approximately 4.1% of the growth in revenue per requisition. Total company volume increased 1.2% year-over-year during the fourth quarter. Genzyme Genetics accounted for approximately 0.6% of this volume growth. Esoteric volume increased approximately 3.5% in the quarter. ","Third, margin. For the fourth quarter our adjusted operating income margin was 18.9% compared to 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Year-over-year margin decline was due entirely to recent acquisitions that we have not fully integrated. Excluding these acquisitions, margins would have remained stable year-over-year. Margins will improve as we integrate these businesses and our guidance for next year implies margin expansion.","Fourth, liquidity. We remain well-capitalized. At the end of December, we had cash of $159.3 million and approximately $400 million available under our revolving line of credit. During the fourth quarter, we replaced existing credit facilities with a new $1 billion revolver. We borrowed $560 million under the new facility and repaid all amounts outstanding under our previous term loan and revolving credit facility. In addition to the cash generated by operations, we believe the new $1 billion revolver will provide us with ready liquidity to carry out strategic initiatives. At the end December, total debt was $2.2 billion.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $172.1 million of stock, representing 2.1 million shares. At the end of December, $84.4 million of repurchase authorization remained under our previously approved share repurchase program.","This morning, we announced that LabCorp's Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program. This authorization reflects our continued commitment to return capital to and create value for our shareholders. This morning, we also announced our 2012 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of 2% to 3.5%; adjusted EPS excluding amortization in the range of $6.75 to $7.05, excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after December 31, 2011; operating cash flow of approximately $950 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $155 million. ","I'll now turn the call over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Brad. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and 2011 results. Before discussing progress on our 5-pillar strategy, I would like to update you on Genzyme Genetics. The integration of Genzyme Genetics continues to go extremely well, and we are very pleased with our retention of Genzyme's clients, as well as our realization of cost savings. The continuing success of the integration will remain a top priority for us throughout 2012, and we remain confident that Genzyme Genetics will be slightly accretive to earnings this year.","In January 2012, as our right to use the Genzyme Genetics name ended, we began rebranding Genzyme Genetics as part of a broader rebranding of LabCorp's specialty testing capabilities to create a consistent market-facing structure. To this end, we adopted the name Integrated Genetics for the reproductive portion of Genzyme's business and LabCorp's Legacy Genetics business. We adopted the name Integrated Oncology for Genzyme's Oncology business and LabCorp's Legacy Oncology businesses. This rebranding effort is an important company-wide initiative that will further the second pillar of our strategy, and that it will simplify and enhance the physician experience in dealing with LabCorp's many specialty businesses and assets. Response to the branding has been positive, and we look forward to continuing to streamline and focus our brands.","Now I'd like to update you on the progress on each aspect of our 5-pillar strategy. The first pillar of our strategy is that we deploy our cash to enhance our footprint and test menu through acquisitions and to repurchase shares. In December, we closed our acquisition of Orchid Cellmark, an international provider of DNA testing services primarily for forensic and family relationship applications. This acquisition strengthens LabCorp's capabilities in forensics and identity testing and establishes our presence in the United Kingdom.","With respect to the U.S. portion of Orchid's business, we are pleased to add to our strong forensics and private paternity business. As we disclosed, we were required to divest certain assets of the government paternity business upon closing the transaction. With respect to the U.K. portion of Orchid's business known as Cellmark, we are pleased to expand our Forensics business to a new market. As many of you know, the U.K. government has decided to close its forensic crime testing operations. Thus, Cellmark has a solid market opportunity in the U.K. and will also enable us to evaluate the opportunity to extend our forensics business into Europe. The integration of Orchid is going well and we expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to our 2012 earnings. We welcome the talented employees of Orchid both here and abroad to our LabCorp family.  Finally, we repurchased approximately $644 million of our shares in 2011.","The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. Last year, we introduced Beacon Order Entry nationally, which allows our customers to place electronic orders for almost all LabCorp brands and services. With the previously released Beacon results delivery capability, customers can now place orders and receive results through a simple, customer-friendly portal.","We have seen strong growth in adoption of Beacon in 2011, making it our fastest-growing external software offering ever. With Apple and Android  versions, we have also brought Beacon capabilities to our growing mobile user base. Additionally, we completed development of the Beacon patient portal. The portal is a secure and easy-to-use online solution that enables patients to receive and share lab results, make appointments, pay bills, set up automatic alerts and notifications and manage health information for the entire family. We currently have an active pilot program, and we plan to launch the portal nationwide later this year.","We continue to improve our electronic medical record connectivity. LabCorp connects to more than 500 EMRs working closely with leading EMR partners to streamline connectivity and enhance lab workflow, assisting clients in seamlessly integrating lab services into their EMR solutions. We added over 6,000 new client EMR interfaces in 2011.","We continue to pursue our differentiated open platform strategy, allowing our customers to connect to LabCorp directly or via their EMR of choice. We made a conscious decision to pursue this open platform approach because it is what our customers want. Going forward, we will continue to enhance our Beacon platform by providing more and better patient and physician-facing IT solutions.","The third pillar of our strategy is to continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. In the fourth quarter, we continued our Touch AccuDraw system implementation to an additional 76 sites. The system is now deployed in more than 1,100 sites across the country and is processing over 1 million accessions per month. We continue to enhance the system that allows our phlebotomists, a critical link in our sample flow, to improve accuracy, workflow and processing time to enhance the patient experience in our patient service centers.","In December, we opened a 110,000-square-foot expansion to our Burlington lab campus. This state-of-the-art facility will provide an improved work environment for our employees and will allow us to consolidate satellite locations and enhance specimen flow. Additionally, it provides significant capacity for future growth.","The fourth pillar of our strategy is to continue scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We introduced 104 new tests in 2011. I would highlight 2 key companion diagnostics that we brought to market in the fourth quarter because they demonstrate our continued leadership in personalized medicine. The first was a new FDA-approved companion diagnostic for use in patients with advanced ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer. The Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH Probe test detects all ALK gene rearrangements and is the only available diagnostic assay that has been clinically validated to predict response to the targeted therapy XALKORI. ","The second is an FDA-approved diagnostic for melanoma patients who have inoperable or metastatic melanoma. The test determines the presence of the BRAF V600E gene mutation within the tumor sample and identifies patients eligible for treatment with Zelboraf.","Last month, we added to our ovarian cancer management tools with a new FDA-cleared assay ,ROMA or Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm. This is a risk stratification tool that combines the results for HE4, ARCHITECT CA 125 and menopausal status into a numerical score, that along with clinical and radiological evaluation, can aid in evaluating whether a woman over the age of 18, who presents with an ovarian mass and for whom surgery is planned, is at a high or low likelihood of having a malignancy. ROMA provides equal sensitivity to other commercially available risk stratification tools with improved specificity for determining the risk level of malignancy.","LabCorp continues to be a leader in the field of chromosomal microarray analysis. In addition to our pediatric, prenatal and conception test offerings, we recently added oncology applications. The LabCorp SNP microarray has been shown to be superior to traditional technologies for the detection of genetic alterations, having greatly improved the copy number resolution and the capacity to detect clinically significant gene conversion associated with pediatric syndromes and clonal  evaluation in cancer.","The fifth pillar of our strategy is to develop alternative delivery models. The Director of the CBO recently pointed out that the results of recent Medicare demonstration projects on disease management and value-based payment, \"suggest that substantial payment -- substantial changes to payment and delivery systems will probably be necessary for such programs to significantly reduce spending and either maintain or improve the quality of care provided to patients.\" We are preparing ourselves for these changes. We continue to discuss alternative models with physicians and our managed care partners, so that we will be well positioned in the future.","As we mentioned last quarter, the recent extension of the UnitedHealthcare contract was an important step in our fifth pillar, as we will continue to be the sole national laboratory for UnitedHealthcare through the end of 2018. Over the next 7 years, both organizations will continue to make investments to help reduce health care costs and improve patient care.","In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance and the progress we have achieved on our strategic initiatives. Although current macroeconomic conditions cause our outlook for volume growth in 2012 to remain muted, we believe that the long-term outlook for our industry is excellent and that over time, volume growth will return to historical levels. ","Now, Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions","Stephen Anderson","Thank you, Dave. ","Can you describe the potential impact for Medicare reform?  As we all know, the Super Committee failed to reach agreement on a $1.5 trillion deficit reduction plan over 10 years. Absent any Congressional activity, mandatory sequestration, including a 2% reduction in the Medicare fee schedule, will be implemented effective January 1, 2013. Congress must also address scheduled reductions to the Medicare physician fee schedule sustainable growth rate by March of this year. There are numerous proposals circulating to address these issues. It is too early for us to predict the impact of any potential reforms. We believe that across-the-board reductions to reimbursement, cost-sharing proposals and arbitrary exclusion of services are bad policy. Such proposals will increase administrative costs to providers, deter patients from seeking early and appropriate care and ultimately increase the cost of health care. We are working closely with the American Clinical Laboratory Association and members of Congress to explain our position on these matters, and will continue to press for responsible reforms and appropriate reimbursement for our services.","Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing? In the fourth quarter, approximately 40% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. As we reiterated last quarter, our new goal is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 45% of our revenue within the next 3 to 5 years.","Can you remind us of how drugs of abuse volume trended during the year? In the fourth quarter, our drugs of abuse volume increased approximately 10% year-over-year. That compares to a year-over-year increase of 9% in Q3 of 2011; 8% in Q2 of 2011; 14% in Q1 of 2011; and 12% in Q4 of 2010. ","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave","David P. King","Thank you, Steve. Thank you very much for listening. Before we take questions, I would like to note that we now have 25 analysts covering our company. So that we may do our best to accommodate everyone, please make your questions brief and to the point, and we will endeavor to answer them in the same fashion. We are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I guess, just maybe a question would just be, as you think about 2012, and you talked about the 5 pillars. But how are you thinking about 2012 relative to last year? What are the big themes? I mean, clearly, you guys are always just see yourself as an operating company and doing the blocking and tackling and following the same strategy. But just curious as your messaging around 2012 and what are you thinking about just kind of big picture for LabCorp and the industry?","David P. King","Adam, it's Dave. The beginning of your question cut off a little bit. So I'm just going to -- I think what you asked is kind of high-level themes for 2012 and beyond?","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","David P. King","Okay. So again, I would repeat that first message is we think that the volume outlook is muted for 2012 because of broad macroeconomic conditions, but still the long-term outlook is excellent. And over time, we believe that we'll return to the historical volume growth rates that we've seen in the industry. So that, probably one high-level theme. Second the importance of continuing the Genzyme Genetics integration, and I would say that has 2 components. The first is growing that business. So we spent a lot of effort this year protecting the client base, making sure that the levels of service remained at expectations, particularly placing value on the genetic counselor network and the importance of that to the clients and to the business. So growing Genzyme Genetics is a very important priority for all the reasons that we've articulated: the genetics franchise, the oncology franchise, the importance of reproductive and oncology testing to our business model of the future. On the other side of that, of course, is continuing to rationalize the cost structure in that business, which will allow us to, as we've said, make it slightly accretive in 2012 and then as we move through 2013 and beyond, get it to company margins and really start to see the earnings power of that business. So both growth and cost rationalization there are going to be extremely important. Third, I would say, is continuing to develop and enhance the focus on our specialty businesses. So we haven't talked a lot about this, but underneath all of the Genzyme acquisition and the rebranding is a, I would say, some changes to the structure of the way that we go to market with our specialty businesses and the way that we message the market, the way we interact with physicians. And think all of those things, the growth in the future, the core business is very important and fundamental to what we do. But growth in the future is increasingly going to come from specialty and esoteric testing. And so, I think, continuing to enhance our market-facing capabilities there is going to be very important in 2012. And then the fourth thing is allocation of capital. So we continue to look for attractive acquisitions, we continue to buy shares, we continue to consider all other aspects of capital allocation. And I think those are -- that's going to be an important priority. And then I would say, last of all, I think that we're going to start to see an acceleration of payers looking at different kinds of models. And so, I think, continuing to invest resources in and collaborate with payers on what other ways are lab services of this care generally going to be delivered will be an important priority for us in 2012. And congruent with that, continuing to improve our own internal efficiencies, so that we can be best positioned in the marketplace. So I know that was a lot, and I failed in responding to your question in a brief and concise fashion, but I hope it was helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Bonello with RBC Capital Markets.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So my question has to do with pricing and mix. It looks like excluding Genzyme, revenue per requisition was essentially flat. I don't think I recall that ever happening in the past, even in 2007 after the big United contract implementation. Can you give us some color on what's happening on that front? Are you seeing less mix shift? Are you losing some of the esoteric testing? Is price coming down? How should we be thinking about that? And then I have one quick follow-up to that.","William B. Hayes","Bill, this is Brad, and I think about that metric from 3 different ways. First of all, year-over-year growth is important, but we also look at what those revenue per requisitions are doing sequentially. And they were sequentially up in Q4 compared to Q3. And especially, across payers, across testing, managed care was up sequentially. And so that's the first thing we do when we're looking at that is say, what happens sequentially? Second, on a year-over-year basis we took 2 looks, one was by payer and the other was by test to your specific point. By payer, our client category is experiencing the fastest volume growth, and our client category has the lowest revenue per requisition. An example of a business that's growing in our client category that Steve Anderson mentioned is our Drugs of Abuse Testing business. So as we see volume growth accelerate above the average in those businesses, it's putting some pressure on the overall price metric. The second is in our patient, in our uninsured population. That volume is our highest priced in terms of revenue per requisition. That volume year-to-date in 2011 was 6.5% lower than 2010. And in the fourth quarter, 8.7% lower than 2010 in the fourth quarter. So we're seeing some acceleration of low-paying or lower-price-point payer categories, and also some deceleration in higher price point categories. On the test mix side, we're also seeing the flattening of Vitamin D and also flattening in our Histology business. So that is also putting pressure on the overall metric.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's extremely helpful. And then just as a follow-up to that, can you kind of help us feel confident then in your ability to reach the 2% to 3.5% revenue growth in 2012? I mean, all in, I think you were less than 1% this quarter. I know you were facing extremely hard comps on the volume side, but just kind of tell us what gives you confidence, how we should think about that?","David P. King","Yes, Bill, it's Dave. So first of all, not to be overlooked, I mean, we're going to get about 1 percentage point of growth from Orchid, the full year impact. So that gets us a reasonable head start toward the number that we put out there. We did have a very difficult volume comp in 4Q of this year versus 4Q of last year. As we went and looked back at 4Q of last year, it was the single largest organic growth quarter in at least the prior 8 quarters. So we're just going up against a tough comp here, which makes the volume growth look less than it was. And I think with what we're hearing in the commentary from the payer community, from WellPoint on their call, from United on their call, they are expecting utilization improvement, particularly in the second half of 2012. So we feel pretty good that all those things in combination will comfortably get us into the revenue guidance range that we've given you. And obviously if -- again, as I've said, we have a pretty muted expectation in terms of volume for 2012. But if volume is better, it gives us additional opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave and Brad, just can you give us a quick update on the attack plan for Orchid in terms of how the consolidation will proceed? And maybe an update on the U.K., is that FSS business getting any closer to you? And then just quickly for Brad, the $0.51 hit from amortization expense in 2011, do you have a guess what that would be for 2012?","David P. King","It's Dave, and I'll start with the Orchid question. So as we said, we divested the state government paternity business or we're in the process of divesting it as part of the resolution of the FTC inquiry. With respect to the private business, I think our current plan is that most of that -- most of our existing forensics business will actually move into the existing Orchid facilities. So what we're doing at our Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology, I think, we'll be moving toward their facilities. And there'll be some -- I'm sure there'll be some rationalization but I think, generally, the businesses are very complementary and give us a nice growth opportunity in private paternity. In terms of the U.K. business, my understanding is that most of the tenders have been resolved and have essentially a 2-year time frame. So there is some -- there are still, I believe, a couple that are waiting to be decided. There's a nice market opportunity as those come up. We've been successful in winning those tenders. The government has closed their private -- sorry, their government forensics lab. So there's basically -- it's basically open to private competition. So we do see some growth opportunity there as the tenders are decided and then as they come up for rebid. And then also, the potential of looking at being able to expand the forensics business outside the U.K. into Europe. No firm plans there, but a good beachhead in the U.K. as we consider that expansion opportunity. And now I'll turn it over to Brad on the amortization.","William B. Hayes","And, Bob, on the amortization, it looks to be roughly the same.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just to follow-up on some of your pricing comments. You had made comments regarding the transition of some of the Genzyme contracts onto some of the legacy LabCorp contracts, and at some point, that would put pressure on the pricing. Did you see some of that in the fourth quarter, and if so how much was in there?","William B. Hayes","Gary, this is Brad. We have -- we did not see any change in the fourth quarter compared to what we had been experiencing throughout 2011.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So how far along in that process are you? And how much additional pricing pressure, if any, would you expect to see from that transition?","William B. Hayes","We're pretty well along, given that we're over a year now from the actual acquisition, so we're pretty far along in that process. There still are some transitions that are scheduled to occur in 2012. But it's definitely baked into our guidance and our thinking for 2012.","David P. King","Gary, it's David. We'll, obviously, reflect in the price metric. As you look at 2012 on a year-over-year comparison because to the extent that we have further adjustments into our contract levels, that'll show up as \"negative price.\"","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But it sound like there's not that much more of that, is that what I'm hearing?","William B. Hayes","I think that's fair to say.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just give us an update on where you are on the Horizon contract?","David P. King","We don't really have an update on the Horizon contract. We continue to discuss a longer-term extension with Horizon, but no final resolution.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I actually had a follow-up on the volume questions that have been asked. I'm curious if you look at the underlying business, what are you guys seeing in terms of seasonality? So typically Q4 was the worst given holiday seasons. But I'm curious if the whole deductible factor has meaningfully changed that pattern over the past couple of years.","David P. King","Amanda, it's Dave. I think that it does have an impact. I mean, obviously, we're dealing with pretty sizable volumes. So it's hard to point to particular facts and figures. But I think it does have an impact. I think if you look at the historic trends for 4Q, and you look at what's happened the last 3 years really, you do see more -- you don't see a pickup, but you see more stability between 3Q and 4Q than we've seen in the past. So I think it has some impact. It'd be hard to quantify.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","We should just expect a similar progression through 2012 as we saw last year, basically.","David P. King","Yes. I would agree with that.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on Genzyme, so you talked to the branding. I'm curious how meaningful is the Genzyme brand to the business? So it is something that could impact the underlying Genzyme attrition rate, which seems to have done better but just curious about 2012.","David P. King","I think the Genzyme Genetics brand is a valuable brand, make no mistake. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, we had a certain time in which we were allowed to use the brand and then the name Genzyme now belongs to somebody else. So the name that we adopted, Integrated Genetics, is actually a legacy brand that was part of Genzyme Genetics and that Genzyme Genetics acquired. So it's familiar to the customers, it's something that they know. There's strong brand recognition within the Genzyme Genetics Reproductive business. So I actually think that the Genzyme organization has welcomed the brand, in that it really completes the separation from Genzyme and is now part of the LabCorp family. And Integrated Oncology just seemed like a good, consistent market-facing brand to adopt once we went with the Integrated Genetics brand. So I think that -- don't mean to, in any way, underestimate the value of the Genzyme Genetics brand, but I think we've made a very smooth transition here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In the past, I think you've talked about sort of needing 4% top line to sort of have leverage to increase margins. So I guess, maybe help us understand where the cost savings is being generated in 2012 to sort of allow you to expand the margins at a fairly decent clip, despite some of the lower top line expectations.","David P. King","I think the place where the cost savings are coming are within the Genzyme business, within Orchid, within the remnants of Westcliff and DCL. So the integration of the acquisitions is a key line of cost savings, as well as Clearstone, the Clearstone acquisition in clinical trials. And then the continuation of all of the efficiency programs that we have been working on; so lab automation, patient service center automation, improvements in the throughput of instrumentation. Those are probably the 2 big categories of cost improvement.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so it's largely all sort of SG&A related if we think about sort of the model on where we would see the greatest opportunity?","David P. King","You'll see some in SG&A, but I think you'll also see some in the gross profit line because that's where the efficiency programs and facility rationalizations and those types of activities will show up.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just my follow-up, any -- remind us again the large contracts that are coming up for renewal in 2012 aside from Horizon that you already talked about.","David P. King","I don't think we have anything sizable in 2012. We go out to 2013 with Cigna and WellPoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So my question is really just about volume. I guess, I hear you, you're not making any call on the economy or any real big improvement for 2012. So we get that part of the guidance. I guess, what I want to just focus on is the deceleration that we did see throughout 2012. And I'd be curious just to get your comments on where you saw the weakness, whether you think there's anything new competitively that's emerged in your markets that's led to some of this organic weakness in recent quarters, or you just chalk it up to a tough comp. Maybe just some framework for thinking about the trend.","William B. Hayes","Yes, Darren, it's Brad. I would say that definitely you touched on something that we've said earlier and want to continue to stress is the tough comp, especially in Q4. I think looking back across the year, the deceleration, I would say, was around in the summer months. And then we saw a stability in the fourth quarter compared to that deceleration, at least in terms of absolute levels of volumes, setting aside the year-over-year comp. Again, back to the tough comp for Q4. So that's the way we think about what happened in 2011. And again, 2012 will be up to the macro environment, as well as what things that we can do internally to offset and outpace that.","David P. King","Yes. Darren, it's Dave. Just to add to that, I mean, again, when we came out of 2011, Q4 was very strong and Q1 of 2012 also started out strong. Then as everybody knows, we saw a deterioration in the macro environment. We saw, I mean, for those who have forgotten, we saw real complete political gridlock for months over Medicare, over the SGR fix, over the debt ceiling. And all of those things, I think, played into the macro environment, which in turn played into people's confidence in going out and spending discretionary dollars on health care. So Q3 was the low point. I think Q4 was a strong volume quarter for us, given the comp and we feel that, that is sustainable going forward. But we're waiting on the economy to improve for us to feel like we can be more confident in our expectations about volume.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And if I could, just to clarify in revenue guidance for '12. Have you contemplated any kind of impact from molecular diagnostic coding changes? Any just comments there would be helpful.","David P. King","No, we have not. Our understanding on the coding changes is that in terms of Medicare, the coding changes are -- whatever they turn out to be, are not going to be implemented in 2012. And the earliest of those will be implemented is 2013. And I think in terms of the private payer community, our sense is that, although they may implement some of the coding, it doesn't lead to structural pricing changes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Management.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, maybe sort of following on one of Darren's questions there. As we think about '12 then, I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but just maybe from a high level. It seems like a fair amount of the earnings growth is sort of coming from the ramp up of acquisitions or synergies related to the acquisitions and inverse to '11, this seemed like that the volume comps get a little easier as the year goes on. So can you give us any sort of high-level thoughts about first half versus second half? Or stronger- and weaker-type quarters given those dynamics?","David P. King","No. I mean, so we don't give quarterly guidance. I don't think it would be reasonable to try to give you anything more than at a very high level. Yes, the comps will get easier in the third and fourth quarters, so that will help volume. The integration synergies from Clearstone and Orchid, there'll be more, probably at the beginning of the year but Genzyme will be relatively stable throughout the year. So I think the earnings pattern is likely to follow the historical pattern, is really about what we can say there.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. That's helpful. And then one follow-up on sort of the competitive environment and pure pricing, was curious what your perspective is there. And also, Dave, was wondering if you could follow up on a comment that you made earlier in '12, maybe seeing payers toy with some new types of payer-type models. Wondering what type of things you may be thinking about.","David P. King","Sure. I think in terms of the competitive environment generally, it's what it's always been, which is it's quite tough. And that's the nature of our industry. It's a very competitive industry, there a lot of players. So there's competition on -- for volume, there's competition on service levels, there's competition on price and there's competition from our customers as we know in Histology with the in-sourcing. And I don't think we see that changing much. In terms of the alternative models, Tom, I mean, I guess what I would say is, if you look at, just even within the last week or 2, WellPoint is talking about paying physicians in different ways. United came out with a pretty comprehensive announcement that they were going to look at whole different methodologies to start paying physicians and they called it transforming the way they pay their provider network in their statement. So if we think that physicians are the only ones who are going to be affected by this, I think we're helping ourselves to a healthy dose of rose-colored glasses. There's clearly going to be different ways in which lab services are going to be paid for, whether it's bundled payments, whether it's payments based on quality of services delivered, whether it's narrowing of networks. I think all of those things are going to come into play. And I think we're very well positioned to participate in that. And I think in the long term, it will be a benefit to LabCorp. But I don't think we should underestimate the fact that the payment models are going to be changing.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can I sneak one more in? What was the ultimate Genzyme dilution for '11?","David P. King","Yes. We're not going to talk about that. We gave you the guidance, and I think that's what we're going to stand on. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple questions. First, I've been listening, I don't think you've kind of parsed this out. But for 2012, I heard your comments on expectations for margin improvement from improved integration of the acquired assets. Is the implied organic revenue growth that you're anticipating, is that at a level that's going to allow you to maintain organic margins? Or would you expect improvement? Would you expect them down slightly? Do you have a general view around that?","William B. Hayes","Gary, this is Brad. I think without the help of some of the efficiency programs that we've talked about before, organic volume at the low end would make it challenging on margins. But again, we have the help of the acquisition integrations in 2012. And as Dave has said several times on the call, we expect growth to accelerate from where we're seeing growth now. So I think looking out into the future, there are margin expansion opportunities for us.","David P. King","Yes. And I just -- I think we stand by that it takes in the range of 4% top line growth to generate real organic margin expansion. And so, if we're not -- so we're going to get margin expansion next year from what we're doing with the acquisitions and from the efficiencies, and we've always got to be making our business more efficient. That's just fundamental. But as, in our perspective, as volume improves over time, we'll see a return to organic margin expansion.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I appreciate that. I just wanted to drill into '12 specifically, a little more detail. My last question, and I apologize, I'm not exactly sure how to ask this. But I was reading about a new initiative that the company has to create kind of esoteric test benefit managers, so to speak, and kind of build a network of other esoteric labs and present this management potentially in a capitated model to payers. And I've forgotten the name of that venture. But is that something that you're willing to talk a little bit about at this point, or is it too early?","David P. King","At a high level, what -- we-call it Beacon LBS. And at a high level, Beacon LBS is a multifaceted offering for both physicians and health plans that has a very simple goal. And the simple goal is to get patients the right tests from the highest quality laboratories at the most effective cost. So there is an option to have narrower lab networks for some esoteric services. There is an option to have physician-decision support in test selection and in guiding care pathways. But the goal is to -- and there's a lot of these models out there, as you know, being offered by others who are not labs and therefore, don't have the expertise to provide these services. But the goal is, again, right test for the right patient from the highest quality laboratory network, at the most effective cost. And this is something that, again, is part of how are we going to look at payment for lab services and how lab services are provided over time. And we think it's very important that we not only participate but lead in initiatives in this area.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with Raymond James.","Alexander  Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, so I appreciate it. Maybe one follow-up on Genzyme. I appreciate you not specifically calling out where the dilution came in, in 2011. So you may not be willing to give a target accretion for '12. But if you're not going to do that, maybe one of the things you're talking about is the incremental growth or benefit in '13. Maybe just remind me of some of the things of why you think '13, you actually see more of a step-up in terms of the accretion and the growth there as opposed to '12?","David P. King","Yes. So we're not going to give target accretion numbers for any of the businesses because, as we've always said, the guidance -- we'll give you a range of guidance because there's a range of outcomes within the guidance. And the minute we start giving individual targets, then we start breaking the guidance down into pennies and nickels and frankly, with a company that's talking about earnings power of $7 a share, it just doesn't make sense to go through it and try to tell you penny by penny, how we get to where we get. So what I would say about Genzyme is that it'll be slightly accretive next year as we've said. I think in 2013, one, we'll realize the full impact of the synergies, which will significantly help in terms of the margin; two, a lot of the investments that we've been making in the IT, for example, when we acquired Genzyme, there was no electronic order and result delivery capability in that business. They just didn't have it. If you think about it, they've done a terrific job growing the business without one of the most fundamental basics, which is allowing physicians to order electronically and get their results delivered electronically. So the investments in the business, the investments in the sales force, the investments in the branding and all of the things that, that will allow physicians to do in terms of ordering other specialty test in the LabCorp core menu from a single order entry and result delivery portal, all these things, I think, are going to lead to strong top line growth as we get through 2012 and 2013, and the improvement on the expense side will lead to real earnings power as we get in the out-years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a follow-up question around Genzyme. Am I looking at the numbers correctly? I'm just trying to understand what the organic growth and recs were for Genzyme in the fourth quarter? Either Brad or Dave, could you help us to understand that? And then my second question, Dave, would just be, do you have any update at all around the Congressional hearings or Congressional inquiry that you've submitted documents to in December?","William B. Hayes","Lisa, this is Brad. I'll start with the organic growth rate. So we reported volume up 1.2%, with Genzyme attributing 0.6% of that. So if we go to that organic number, it's 0.6%.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so that's organic. Because last year in the fourth quarter, didn't you have some level of Genzyme in the fourth quarter as well?","William B. Hayes","We did. So it's apples-to-apples. So when we backed it out of the fourth quarter last year, even backing out Genzyme, we were at 3.2%.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But when we look at our numbers, it looks like that has slowed and has slowed sequentially, is that the right way to look at it? And if that's the case, is there something behind that slowing growth rate?","David P. King","I think we got 2 things confused here. We don't break out the Genzyme volume specifically. So I don't know if you're trying to back into that from the numbers that we've given you for Genzyme's contribution to our overall volume growth, but....","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. That is what we're trying to do. And you're saying that it's not possible to do that based on the information you give us?","David P. King","Well, I'm just saying, remember that in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had 3 months of Genzyme, and in the fourth quarter of 2011 we had 1 month of Genzyme. So you're not -- you don't have a...","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Apples to apples.","David P. King","Exact comparison, and that's probably why you're seeing something that we're not seeing.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then, Dave, do you have any update on -- have you heard anything further from this Congressional inquiry?","David P. King","All I would say on that is that, we continue to believe that this is based on the allegations of the Q10 that was filed, the NPT case. We are working cooperatively with the Senate Finance Committee staff to respond to their questions. And obviously, we'll update you as matters progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Dave, just thinking about what Palmetto's going to do with the McKesson's Z-code. I'm just curious what your take is on the whole matter and how big of a deal you think this is for LabCorp, and how prepared you are for the changes?","David P. King","Well, so first of all, let me reiterate that we are strong supporters of transparency in billing and coding and always have been. So I think anything that creates better transparency for payers in billing and coding is a good thing. I think, Kevin, that Palmetto is in the process of reevaluating their program. My understanding is they've delayed the implementation date of the program until May, and they're looking at some other options for how they would evaluate these tests. And so, we're working with them to try to devise a -- and ACLA, by the way, it's not LabCorp alone. LabCorp, ACLA, all of the ACLA members, the CCLA too are working with them to try to devise a system that is going to be fair, that's going to respond in a reasonable time frame to requests for coding for new molecular testing that's going to lead to fair payment with transparency on their side of what they're paying for.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","No, I appreciate that. And, I guess, the bigger question is, why would they add another level of complexity? I understand the transparency issue. But obviously, you've got a lot of moving parts now. And how much exposure do you guys have? Have you applied for any of the Z-codes yet?","David P. King","I don't think it would behoove us to talk specifically about the actions that we've taken. I will say, I think our exposure is -- remember, this applies so far just to the California region, where they are the Medicare carrier. Our exposure is relatively limited both because of the number of tests and because of the region. But we're trying to work with Palmetto in a collaborative way to do something that's fair and equitable for all of the labs and allows the labs to get coding and reimbursement that's satisfactory to Palmetto and satisfactory to the labs and fair payments. So I don't think we should get hung up on the individual parts of the process. We should think about it as a long-term process. Billing and coding transparency will be a positive thing.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then just my follow-up is, given the current environment and organic growth coming in a little bit and your outlook for 2012. I guess, what do you think about the strategic acquisition environment? Are there some good deals out there? And then, how do you manage or think about using free cash flow? At what point will you consider paying a dividend versus continuing to buy back stock?","David P. King","As I mentioned in response, I think, to the very first question, one of the things that we're always looking at is capital structure and how we deploy capital. I think there are some attractive acquisition opportunities. There are, as always, there are plenty of things in the market. We're very selective about what we're interested in. And so we'll continue to look at acquisitions. We always evaluate in terms of allocation of capital, whether it makes sense to pay a dividend. That's something that is always under consideration and that we talk about a lot. And we'll continue to talk about it and some of it will depend obviously in, are we right about our view of return to historic volume growth over time. Because if we're not right, it suggests a different sort of capital allocation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One follow-up question on Genzyme, and I'm just trying to look at it from a little bit of a different perspective. So based on the data points that you gave us, we calculated about 7% to 8% step-down in top line contribution once you annualize the contribution from 4Q '11 to 4Q '12. So one, are we kind of in the ballpark? And if so, is this how we should think -- is this kind of like the run rate that we should think of for 2012, factoring in kind of like the changes in commercial reimbursement, et cetera? Should kind of like Genzyme top line contribution should be done on a run rate by about 7% to 8%, '12 versus '11? Just trying to break down kind of like the top line growth components.","David P. King","Ricky, it's Dave. We don't see that math at all. So what I would suggest is get with Steve and Brad afterwards, if you want to walk through the math. Because I don't think it's going to be productive to try to walk through it on the call. But I will say, we don't see anything like that kind of step-down. And in fact, Genzyme had a very strong year 2012 versus 2011, and a very consistent rate of growth year-over-year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just to clarify, the pricing reduction for managed care contract, which you've talked about, has been completely -- you expect to be completely offset in some more by volume growth? Is that how I should read your comment?","David P. King","No. I don't think I said that. I think what I said is that the -- although that would be my hope, but I think what I said is that the contribution throughout the year in terms of revenue stability was quite stable. And that the growth throughout the year, year-over-year in revenues in terms of revenue was quite stable.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And that's your expectation for '12?","David P. King","Yes. I mean, as Brad commented earlier, there -- incorporated in the guidance is some managed care compression that hasn't fully shown up in the numbers. But our expectation for '12 is, and I think we said this in response to the very first question, the growth of the Genzyme business year-over-year from a volume perspective is a very important priority for us.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I understand. But my question is, does guidance factor in that growth or is it just -- or is it upside to your guidance number?","David P. King","The guidance incorporates all of our assumptions and expectations about all the components of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Just quick questions for me. Your view of 2012, is histology as a mix of revenues up, down or flat? And then finally, all in for 2011, how many bolt-on acquisitions did you do? And if you could parse out the organic revenue growth attributed to those bolt-on acquisitions, and what's your outlook for '12? So the smaller acquisitions like customer lists, et cetera.","David P. King","So histology in 2012, our expectation is basically flat and we don't break down the individual acquisitions or the number of acquisitions. As we've said, small acquisitions are a part of what we believe to be our organic growth and we expect we'll do a similar number in 2012 that we -- to what we did in 2011.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay. And actually one more follow-up if I could. Any competitive share shift you're seeing from Quest given the turmoil at the top of the management team there?","David P. King","Well, I'm not going to associate myself with any comments about our competitor. I think we \u2013 I think they're a tough competitor, they continue to be a tough competitor in the marketplace. I think we've done a great job over the last multiple years in attracting business away from them with IT improvements and service improvements and we're going to continue to stay focused on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashim Anand with Natixis.","Ashim Anand - Natixis Bleichroeder LLC, Research Division","My question was regarding the ROMA algorithm for ovarian cancer. It is actually quite exciting to see that only with 2 markers, HE4 and CA 125, you are able to achieve a 92% sensitivity, which is equal then to OVA-A (sic) [OVA1] by Quest and Vermillion, which have 5 markers. So if you can comment more on that test. And also related, if there is any commentary from American College of OB\/GYN or Society for Gynecologist -- Gynecological Oncologists in terms of ROMA. And finally, for this test to become screening test, is that a goal? And if that is a goal, do you think addition of more markers would achieve that goal?","David P. King","Okay. So that was a lot, and we'll try to answer it all. First of all, it's cleared by the FDA for assessment of malignancy in patients presenting for surgery. It's not cleared for screening and we don't market it for screening. Over time, if the assay would become cleared for screening or if with the additional -- with the addition of additional markers, it could be re-presented to the FDA for screening, that's certainly something we would be interested in. Remember, because of the low incidence of ovarian cancer in the population, it's challenging to get a screening test that's going to have the sensitivity and specificity that we would like. But we've been working on that for a long time and will continue to do so. In terms of the science behind the test and the Vermillion test, what I would say is, obviously, FDA was satisfied in terms of clearing the test with the sensitivity. What we like about it is the greater specificity than the competitive test. And so, overall, I think it's a very attractive market opportunity. But recognize, it's part of an evaluation, along with radiological and clinical signs and symptoms, of a relatively small population, which is women presenting with an ovarian mass for surgery and trying to assess malignancy. So I hope that answered it, and I think that's about all the time that we -- we have one more question? We have one more question.","Operator","It looks like it comes on the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","It will be quick. You said you had 104 new tests in 2011. Can you just compare that to what you had in 2009 and 2010?","David P. King","It's probably about comparable to 2010 and probably a little more than 2009. But that's -- we kind of think about 20 to 30 new tests a quarter being introduced as being our expectation and our goal.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And same thing for 2012?","David P. King","I would expect so. Not having a whole list in front of me, but that's just -- that's what we've historically seen as kind of the typical output.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that'll conclude the question-and-answer portion for our event.

My name is Clinton, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'd now like to hand the call over to David King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed, sir.","David P. King","Thank you, Clinton. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today from LabCorp are Brad Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; Adam Feinstein, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy; and Steve Anderson, Vice President, Investor Relations.","This morning, we will discuss our third quarter 2013 financial results, update our 2013 guidance, discuss the payment landscape, highlight our progress on our Five Pillar Strategy and provide answers to several frequently asked questions.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Anderson, who has a few comments before we begin.","Stephen Anderson","Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via the telephone and Internet. Please refer to today's press release for replay information.","This morning, the company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information. Additionally, we refer you to today's press release, which is available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS, excluding amortization; free cash flow; and adjusted operating income.","I would also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the company's financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2012 10-K and subsequent filings. The company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now Brad Hayes will review our financial results.","William B. Hayes","Thank you, Steve. On today's call, I will review 4 key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. I'll also update our 2013 guidance.","First, cash flow. Our cash flow continues to be solid, although year-to-date, it continued to be impacted by delays in payment and denials of coverage for existing tests by some payors after implementation of recently adopted molecular pathology codes. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2013 were $620.2 million. DSO at the end of September was 50 days, which was flat sequentially and remains elevated due to our experience with the molecular pathology codes to which I just referred, increased utilization by uninsured patients and increased patient billing due to plan design changes. During the quarter, our bad debt remained 4.3%.","Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 3% year-over-year in the third quarter. During the quarter, total company volume increased 5.1%. Organic volume increased approximately 2% year-over-year, primarily from our toxicology business. Revenue per requisition decreased to 1.9% year-over-year. Revenue per requisition decreased year-over-year due largely to previously discussed government payment reductions, payment issues related to molecular pathology codes and strong growth in our toxicology business.","Third, margin. For the third quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 17% compared to 18.2% in the third quarter of 2012. Margins were negatively affected by Medicare payment reductions, delays and denials of coverage by some payors after the implementation of recently adopted molecular pathology codes and the implementation of sequestration on April 1.","Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of September, we had cash of $174.1 million and $372 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion credit facility. During the third quarter, we repurchased $288 million of stock, representing 2.9 million shares. During the first 9 months of 2013, the company repurchased $763.9 million of stock, representing 7.9 million shares. At the end of September, $304 million of repurchase authorization remained under our share repurchase program.","Our share repurchase activity during the third quarter reflects our continued disciplined capital allocation program and commitment to return capital to our shareholders. This morning, we announced that LabCorp's Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program.","This morning, we updated our 2013 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of approximately 3%; adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, of $6.95 to $7.05; operating cash flow of approximately $825 million to $850 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $210 million. The guidance includes the negative impact of approximately $0.35 due to Medicare payment reductions. In addition, the guidance includes the negative impact of molecular pathology payment issues, which is not included in the $0.35 that I just mentioned. The guidance excludes the impact of any share repurchase activity after September 30, 2013. The company's capital expenditure guidance is higher than historical levels due to near-term investments in facility consolidation and the replacement of a major testing platform.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Brad. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. During the quarter, we grew revenue 3%, we grew volume 5.1%, and organic volume by approximately 2%, a notable achievement in this environment. We continue to execute well on our key growth initiatives. We maintained pricing discipline. And this morning, we announced that LabCorp's Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program. This authorization clearly demonstrates our commitment to our stated capital allocation objectives and continuing to return more capital to our shareholders.","I would now like to provide an update on our payment landscape. We continue to maintain our disciplined approach to managed care pricing. Our payment experience with respect to the recently implemented molecular pathology codes has improved, but remains challenging. As we noted last quarter, we are experiencing delays in the pricing and coverage decisions related to these codes among various payors including Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE and commercial carriers. These coverage decisions are contrary to long-established standards of care and will ultimately be harmful to patients. We continue to work diligently with payors to address these payment issues, and ACLA and our industry colleagues are fully engaged. These delays and denials of coverage had a negative impact on revenue; price; operating income; adjusted EPS, excluding amortization; and cash flow during the first 9 months of 2013. And this is incorporated in our 2013 guidance.","Once again, the industry is being harmed and the harm is not only to LabCorp, but also to hospital labs, academic labs and other independent labs. Our industry cannot and should not be expected to provide critical services to patients without receiving payment.","I would now like to update our progress on each aspect of our Five Pillar Strategy. The first pillar of our strategy is that we deploy capital to investments that enhance our business and return capital to shareholders. We repurchased $288 million of our stock during the quarter, representing 2.9 million shares. This brings our total repurchase activity for 2013 to approximately $764 million, representing 7.9 million shares. Our share repurchase to-date brings us closer to our target leverage ratio of 2.5x net-debt-to-EBITDA.","In addition, the acquisition pipeline remains attractive. We remain focused on finding the best strategic fits for our business, while maintaining a disciplined approach to valuation. We believe that acquisitions will be an increasingly attractive way to expand our test menu and geographic footprint for the next several years.","The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. We are pleased to announce that Baroma Inc., the parent company to the first accountable care organization to participate in the Medicare shared savings program in Miami-Dade County Florida, has adopted LabCorp's Beacon analytics platform. After reviewing multiple software products, Baroma charge -- Baroma chose our Beacon analytics platform to help them unify the multiple components of population health management. Baroma will use the scalability and connectivity of LabCorp's analytics solutions to provide primary care physicians with complete access to their patients' health care picture. Beacon analytics solutions will aid Baroma and other providers in reducing expenses, improving outcomes and enhancing patient satisfaction.","We continue to help customers analyze their population health and clinical practice data with new tools for hospitals, physician practices and ACOs, supplemented with insights derived from our extensive patient database through our Beacon analytics platform. This platform includes more than 600 clinical quality measures covering MSSP and Physician Quality Reporting System requirements.","We also continue to improve our tools that assist physicians and patients in better understanding test results and optimizing their decision-making. Patient registrations on our portal continue to grow. Looking ahead, we are expanding the conditions covered by comprehensive clinical reports that integrate and track test results for at-risk patients. Consistent with our knowledge strategy, we are providing health care stakeholders knowledge products that optimize decision-making, improve health outcomes and reduce treatment costs.","The third pillar of our strategy is to continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. Our initial installation of our Propel robot in our Burlington campus is now complete. Propel represents a significant investment in innovation that will decrease our labor expense, increase throughput and accuracy, and enhance specimen management and quality metrics in the lab.","Construction on our new Phoenix campus is complete. We began consolidation activity and testing operations at this campus in late September. And we will continue consolidating additional labs into this facility through the remainder of the year.","We have also commenced the installation of our new automated chemistry platform. The first wave of this enterprise-wide install has been completed in our Burlington and San Diego labs. Our Raritan lab will begin conversion later this fall. These instruments, enabled by advanced software systems, will increase testing throughput and reduce labor and supply expenses.","The fourth pillar of our strategy is to continue scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We introduced new tests and collaborate with leading companies and academic institutions to provide our physicians and patients with the most scientifically advanced testing in our industry. As we stated last quarter, we will enter the BRCA testing market and we are laying the groundwork and building the database to support the launch of this test during the fourth quarter. Our BRCA test and the genetic counseling services accompanying it will be powerful tools for the assessment of breast cancer risk. With 150 genetic counselors on staff, LabCorp has, by far, the world's largest community of skilled professionals trained to analyze, assess and interpret genetic test results and communicate them in a meaningful way to physicians and patients.","In addition to our next-generation sequencing offerings for familial cardiac diseases and the preclinical and clinical development of new HIV and HCV antiviral drugs, we are pleased to announce that we will offer our first multigene oncology panel on the NGS platform later this year. The panel improved the sensitivity and detection rates for somatic mutations in cancer, assessing more than 2,700 mutations within 50 APA genes and tumor-suppressor genes. The panel has utility mainly in patients with solid tumors, but include some specific applications in leukemia and lymphoma, which can help guide physicians in their treatment decisions for these cancers.","Over the next several quarters, we will offer more comprehensive oncology panels that include additional content covering liquid tumors, gene rearrangements and prognostic and predictive markers. We will also offer additional targeted tests, such as a test for Lynch Syndrome, which is an inherited genetic condition associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Important components to our NGS oncology offerings are 2 companion diagnostic tests associated with new cancer drugs. We recently launched the cobas EGFR Mutation Test, a real-time PCR assay designed to detect deletion mutations in exon 19 and the substitution mutation, L858R, in exon 21. The cobas EGFR Mutation Test is used as a companion diagnostic for Tarceva, and the targeted population is likely to experience clinical benefits compared to patients treated with chemotherapy.","In addition, we recently launched the therascreen KRAS test, which is the only FDA-approved companion diagnostic for use with ERBITUX in patients with KRAS-mutation-negative, wild-type, epidermal growth factor receptor expressing metastatic colorectal cancer. Therascreen KRAS detects the 7 KRAS mutations that have proven clinical applications.","The fifth pillar of our strategy is to integrate our offerings into emerging health care delivery models. Our strategy to become a knowledge partner has spurred our development of new products and capabilities. We are very pleased to announce that BeaconLBS recently signed an agreement with UnitedHealthcare to implement its products in Florida. We anticipate implementation in the latter half of 2014, and we are excited about the benefits to patients, physicians and employer groups. We look forward to updating you on this important initiative over the next several quarters.","In the era of health care reform, the critical components of success will be quality, cost and a central role in improving patient outcomes. LabCorp is uniquely positioned to achieve these goals in the years to come.","Now Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.","Stephen Anderson","Thank you, Dave. Can you elaborate on LabCorp's capital allocation policy?","As we have stated throughout 2013, we are committed to achieving a 2.5x net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We have taken steps toward this goal over the last 2 quarters. Based on our capital allocation history, we target half of our free cash flow for acquisitions and half for share repurchase. In the absence of a large acquisition over the next year, we would anticipate using additional leverage to repurchase shares. We have a strong history of returning capital to our shareholders. Over the last decade, we have repurchased $5.3 billion of our stock, representing 79.7 million shares at a price of approximately $67.","Why are capital expenditures expected to be so high in 2013?","We typically spend approximately 3% of revenue on capital expenditures. Our capital expenditure increase in 2013 is driven by near-term investments in facility consolidation and replacement of a major testing platform.","What is included in, and excluded from, your 2013 guidance?","Our 2013 guidance includes the negative impact of approximately $0.35 due to Medicare payment reductions. In addition, our guidance includes the negative impact of molecular pathology payment issues, which is not included in the $0.35 that I just mentioned. And our guidance excludes the impact of any share repurchase activity after September 30, 2013.","Can you remind us of how drugs-of-abuse volume trended during the year?","In the third quarter, our drugs-of-abuse volume increased approximately 14% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the MEDTOX acquisition. This compares to a year-over-year increase of 10.6% in Q2 of 2013, 10.2% in Q1 of 2013 and 6.8% in Q4 of 2012. We also delivered strong year-over-year growth this quarter in our wellness and pain management businesses, which fall within our occupational testing services operations. We believe wellness and pain management testing will provide a great growth opportunity for LabCorp over the next several years.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve, and thank you very much for listening. We are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","[indiscernible] of the molecular pathology payment issues?","David P. King","Gary, sorry, the only thing we heard in your question was molecular pathology payment issues. Can you state it again, please?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sorry, I was wondering if you could quantify what the negative impact is from it for the year?","David P. King","No. We haven't quantified it specifically,, in large part because our hope is we'll see continued improvement. So I'm just not prepared to do that right now.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But conceivably, if the issues get worked out, are you optimistic that you could recoup the payments that you haven't received or you think it would only be fixed sort of going forward?","David P. King","I think we feel that if the issues are worked out, we have the opportunity to recoup the payments that we -- that have been delayed.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And are you optimistic that happens before the end of the year or you think it takes longer than that?","David P. King","I think some of it would be resolved by the end of the year and some of it will go over into next year. There are multiple payors, multiple issues, it's a complex discussion. We've had a terrific team working on it from our side and we've had great collaboration in terms of the payors being willing to listen to us and try to work with us, but I don't think it's realistic to think we'll get it all resolved in the next couple of months.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the volume experience, it seems like your experience is somewhat more positive than your largest competitor. Do you think that -- do you think you guys are taking share or what -- what, if anything, do you think you could attribute that to?","David P. King","I'm not going to speculate on things like taking share. I'm going to tell you that I think our volume experience is based on exceptional operational focus and execution. We have a terrific team of senior leaders in this company, starting from the men and women who run the operating divisions, going down through the sales leadership, going down to the sales force feet on the street. And we have been talking to them throughout 2013 about the importance of growth. And what you're seeing is just excellent execution, excellent blocking and tackling on a day-to-day basis in every aspect of our business, and that's where the volume is coming from.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So maybe if I ask it another way. Do you feel like you guys are growing faster than the overall market or is the growth accelerated from last year? How do you feel about that?","David P. King","I think the utilization environment has improved. I think some of the initiatives that we've put in place, particularly around things like our wellness testing, are bearing fruit. And again, I think we are focusing on the growth opportunities. And with everybody's shoulder to the wheel on the operational team, we're performing very well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Hima Inguva of Bank of America.","Hima B. Inguva - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I would like to know your thoughts on consolidation within lab space. Your main competitor has been reporting soft quarters the past few quarters, so I would like to know if you would be open to a large transformation acquisition if a right strategic target comes along?","David P. King","I think we are always open to acquisitions. And acquisitions have historically been an important part of the first pillar of our strategy, based both on the ability to expand our test menu and on the ability to expand our footprint. So we're open to the opportunity to make any acquisition that will benefit our long-term strategy. The key factors are: is the asset attractive, is it strategic for us and is the valuation appropriate. And within those parameters, we would consider whatever came along that would be interesting to us.","Hima B. Inguva - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And as a follow-up, do you have any target range in terms of size and your commitment to investment grade ratings?","David P. King","Well, target range in terms of size, as we have historically mentioned, we think about -- in a typical year, or I should say in kind of a -- over a typical period of years, that half of our free cash flow goes to acquisitions and half of it goes to share repurchase. Obviously, we have done some sizable transactions in the past. We are proud of -- and our investment-grade credit rating, we think it remains important in this environment. And it's always something that we take into consideration when we think about transactions.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum.","William B. Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Brad, are you going to buy a baseball team?","William B. Hayes","Good question, Bill. Probably not. I might work in the stands there.","William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Got it. I think that would be fitting. Couple of other questions. Just a follow-up on the molecular coding question, I just want to make sure I understand the accounting there. I know you got into this a little bit last quarter, I think it was. But am I right that for at least some of these denials or delays, you are not recording the revenues. So you're performing the test, you're not recording the revenue, you're incurring the expense. So that if you did eventually get paid, that would just sort of flow through to pretax or is that a misunderstanding?","William B. Hayes","Bill, this is Brad. That's a correct understanding. I mean, given the situation and the uncertainty, we have recorded reserves against that revenue based on what we think we're ultimately going to collect, but a lot of that has a pessimistic view on it, given what we've heard recently. But we continue to work with payors, as Dave said, in a very focused way. And it is payor-by-payor to get a more favorable outcome of the initial reactions. I would say that, generally speaking, and again it's different for every payor, but generally speaking, the updates that I get on a very regular basis suggest that a number of payors are still being educated on exactly what the change was. So even though we're in October of this year, we're still spending a lot of time educating payors on what happened, what was it like last year, what is it like this year, and are working to have that turn in our favor.","William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, Dave, just wondering if you could add a little bit more color on the Baroma and UNH relationships? Maybe give us some sense of how that economic model works and whether there's any kind of a network component to what you're doing with either of those organizations?","David P. King","Well, Bill, with Baroma, it's the parent company of Medicare Shared Savings ACO. There is an economic component. I'm not prepared to discuss it separately, but I think it's an economic component that will be rewarding both for us and for Baroma. And with BeaconLBS, again, as we said, we've -- BeaconLBS has signed the contract with United. Implementation will be in 2014 and we'll give updates as we get closer to the implementation date in terms of what that entails and what it means. But again, we see the opportunity to benefit physicians, patients and employer groups in the administration of lab services in that market.","William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. But not -- don't -- I mean, should we -- it sounds like you just don't want to say maybe yet or don't know but, I mean, it could potentially just be the analytical support piece or -- and not some kind of preferred lab network or -- I mean, just trying to think how we would think about that?","David P. King","Let's say that I prefer not to say.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dave, you mentioned that you would bring the BRCA test to launch in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just talk about what your expectations would be as far as garnering market share around that test as we move through '14?","David P. King","It's a big day for questions about market share, isn't it, Lisa? We have some assessment of what we think the market is and what we think the opportunity is. And I don't think it benefits anybody to -- well, I don't think it benefits us to kind of go into a lot of detail about that. Let me just say that I think there is a desire in the market for alternatives. We are very focused on not only the validation of this test, but particularly, the ability to call the variance of unknown significance. The genetic counselors provide us with, I think, a substantial differentiation in the marketplace, and we have not only the largest, but I think the best, terrific team of genetic counselors to support our reproductive genetic works. So I think there will be the opportunity to make a substantial impact in that market and we look forward to the launch of the test when we're satisfied that we're ready.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then my second question would just be around the Affordable Care Act and moving into 2014, especially on the exchange side. Clearly, you have a very large partner in United. But my question is around, one, are there separate contracts for the exchanges? And then secondly, are you seeing narrow networks around the exchanges and would you expect that you'll see an increase in volume based on who your partners are in the market?","David P. King","So far, I don't think we're being asked to contract separately for the exchanges. There has been a lot of talk about the narrowing of networks, but I think this is very much a work in process and I think 2014 will be the year of learning for all of us about the exchanges. I mean, I was certainly reviewing some of the exchange literature recently. And for example, the -- some of the bronze plans have no out-of-network benefit except for emergency room services. The silver and gold plans have higher benefits, which suggest broader networks. So I just really think this is going to be a learning experience for us and for everybody else during 2014. And I think it would be very hard to talk specifically about expectations, but we are committed through our partners to serving the exchanges and look at that in the long term, certainly, as an opportunity for further growth.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And are you still positive, Dave, on the long-term opportunities around ACA?","David P. King","Absolutely. I mean, we're going to have more patients who have coverage, we're going to have fewer uninsured. And we think in -- at LabCorp, about driving innovation across scale, driving opportunity across scale and driving growth across scale. And so more people with insurance coverage gives us more opportunity to grow.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So one follow-up on the molecular diagnostic issues. I mean, set aside the delay in payments. When you kind of like think kind of like forward-looking into 2014, are you now at kind of like a new kind of like re-based with payors, commercial payors, as well, where, in the future, you're just not going to run these additional tests? So just trying to understand kind of like what it means just for the opportunity longer term?","David P. King","Ricky, it's Dave. I think it's too early to talk about how we would address the problem if we ended","up being told, \"You're just not going to get paid for this,\" because I'm not prepared to concede at this point that we're not going to get paid. So as I said on the last quarter call and repeated on this call, I would hate to see patients deprived of needed services based on payment policies that are contrary to standards of care and contrary to historic payment policies. And I would hate to see labs put in the position of having to decide whether to perform those services or not. But to go back to Bill's question, we perform the test, we incur the expense, we realize no revenue, that puts us in a difficult situation as well. So it's too early to say definitively how we would address that, but I will say I think it's very important for payors to realize the implications of these decisions and to reconsider whether this is really the outcome that they want for their patients.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then with the first 2 weeks, you kind of talked about this shutdown, the clinical lab fee schedule has been kind of like on hold. Do you have any updates on when we should expect it to be out?","David P. King","I do not, and I don't know whether there'll be any delay as a result of the government shutdown.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Dave, I guess, first off, could you talk about Canada, kind of what opportunities do you see on the horizon? Specifically, I saw something in the news about Alberta Health Services is planning to maybe privatize its whole lab business and that could be -- it looks like it could be very significant, maybe worth $3 billion over 15 years. Is that something you guys have seen yet?","William B. Hayes","Kevin, this is Brad. Obviously, we've followed that situation closely. We are partners in the private lab that's already in Alberta that has part of that work today. So there is an opportunity for that work to grow based on that proposal that's out there.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And when you say the private lab, you're talking about DynaLIFE, Brad?","William B. Hayes","Yes, yes.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. But that's not majority-owned, though, is that correct?","William B. Hayes","That's correct. Around 44% or so LabCorp owned.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Got it. And then since I have you, Brad, just wondering, the toxicology business is obviously growing pretty nicely, with wellness and pain management as well. Just wondering, that is lower-price business, right?","William B. Hayes","Yes.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So if we backed out that growth, wondering what your rev-per-req growth would look like? Instead of down 1.9%, would it have been down maybe like 1%? Have you done that math?","William B. Hayes","Yes, we're not sharing exactly those specifics, but it's obviously one of the categories. I mean, the government reductions are probably one significant component, the MoPath issues that we talk about. And then the third is the one you mentioned, that's the growth of business that's roughly half of the average-price business, so it's obviously a large moving part.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then, Dave, just kind of conceptually, big picture. I know you believe that the industry will eventually get back to the 4% to 6% organic growth. Just wondering kind of what are your latest thoughts on how far out that could be or how close we could be to getting back to that type of organic growth.","David P. King","Well, I think I have said 4% to 6% top line growth, so there's -- so some of that's revenue, some of that's organic volume, some of that potentially is acquisition volume, Kevin. But my answer is we had a nice quarter from a revenue and a volume perspective here. We had the pricing issues that I think everybody pretty much knew about. But it does give me greater optimism that we're returning to a time in which we would see better top line industry growth. Now as I said before, I think 2014 is going to be a learning year for everybody because of the implementation of the ACA, the exchanges, the challenges that have -- people have experienced so far in signing up for the public exchanges. So I think it's going to be wait-and-see for 2014. But I think we're going to see continued improvement in trends and that -- the center point is lab services are vital to the health care system. They're a fraction of the cost at 2%. They -- the lab values are 50% of the data elements in patient's electronic health records. And our industry is going to continue to be a vital contributor to the improvement of health care in the U.S. And that, to me, implies that we will see top line growth.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dave, I was interested in your comments regarding the oncology panel you guys are working on. Was hoping you could maybe put some color around your strategy there and anything you could offer with regards to how you plan to price that test and where you think you need to be competitively to be effective in the marketplace in terms of service levels and genetic content, that kind of stuff.","David P. King","I don't think we're prepared to talk about pricing at this point because, obviously, that's a discussion with payors. But I certainly think there is increasing evidence about the value of assessing tumors through next-generation sequencing methodology. I think that our outstanding team of clinicians and scientists has focused on not what's the broadest spectrum that we could test, but what are the key things, the key genes that need to be looked at and the key items within the tumor that need to be evaluated. And in that context, have, as I mentioned, selected these 50 APA genes and tumor-suppressor genes or approximately 50 APA genes and tumor select -- suppressor genes to look at 2,700 important and powerful mutations. So this is our -- this will be our initial launch. We will continue to add content and services. Again, I go back to our genetic counselors, I go back to the number of tests that we perform and the size of the databases that we bring to bear. And I think LabCorp has a very, very important role to play in better diagnosis and treatment of complex cancer.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. And if I could just ask a follow-up there. Conceptually, we're still obviously, as you pointed out, learning what these tests can be used for. But it seems to me, structurally, that they're very complicated tests to run. So what I'm interested to know is if you have a strong view as to how much of gene-based cancer diagnostics will be done by centralized labs versus these distributed products, because you've got a lot of sequencing companies trying to come up with kitted versions of cancer diagnostics that might be distributed out to hospital labs. And it just seems like, to me, that this is a market that would really require a more specialized central lab. So do you have a strong view as to sort of how much will get done centralized versus distributed? I'd be interested in that.","David P. King","I agree with your view. I mean, I think it'll -- I think this will be -- these are complex and sophisticated tests. They require a high degree of specialization, and so I think the centralized scale reference laboratory is going to be the obvious place to perform them. I also think that the ability to interpret and deliver the content is going to be absolutely critical, and you're going to need to see enough of these to be able to develop a robust database and robust content. And again, I think we're in an excellent position to do that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor of Citi.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, do you have any update, just kind of on your outlook for the pathology cuts on the physician fee schedule for '14? And anything new since the last call on the possible re-basing of the clinical lab fee schedule in '15?","David P. King","On the OPPS proposal, ACLA and a number of other groups have met with CMS and expressed our views. In addition, a letter went to CMS from -- signed by 115 congressmen. There is a similar letter that is, I believe, being circulated in the Senate or has been sent already, signed by 36 senators, asking CMS to withdraw the proposal. So I think there's been a very, very solid effort to identify the policy issues that, we believe, are not correctly stated within the proposed rule. And I think the fact that 115 members of Congress and 36 senators have agreed with us and signed a letter asking to withdraw the proposal is evidence that we've made substantial progress on that front. In terms of the clinical lab fee schedule proposal, as mentioned previously, the government has been shut down for the last couple of weeks. There are a large number of proposals circulating, and ACLA and the laboratory industry continue to be very, very much involved in trying to shape the discussion about the future of the clinical lab fee schedule.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Two quick questions, maybe for Brad. Is there any chance you could give us acquisition spend for the third quarter?","William B. Hayes","Gary, I don't have that in front of me but it's not a lot. I think year-to-date, it's $100 million. I think in the third quarter, it was very small.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And when you -- I just want to recall correctly, when you talk about kind of the 2% organic volume, MEDTOX is the only thing that's being excluded? Are some of these smaller tuck-in acquisitions included or excluded from that number?","William B. Hayes","Small tuck-in acquisitions would be included in the organic number.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then last question. I know the 4Q earnings guidance excludes any repurchase after the end of the quarter. How much would the diluted share count drop sequentially even if you did no additional share repurchase? In other words, just trying to think about the timing of the repurchase through the -- throughout the third quarter. Would you naturally have an additional sequential decline in share count even without additional share repurchase?","William B. Hayes","Yes, because you'd get the full impact of the ones that we bought in any quarter. That would bring down the share count in a subsequent quarter by being fully outstanding for that amount of time.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, off the top of your head, do you have a number in mind for diluted share count? Or what's the diluted share count implied in the 4Q?","William B. Hayes","I don't have that raw off the top of my head. But I mean, if we'd just kind of use a half-quarter convention, you could think that what we bought in the third quarter was half outstanding in the third and would be fully outstanding in the fourth.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Brad, glad to see you're joining Wes Elingburg in that great campground of retirement, but good luck to you there. Question for Dave, just you had a nice return on the FMI investment stake. Is there much behind that in terms of other investments we should focus on, with the equity markets now open and more deals coming out there? And maybe, if not, why isn't that an opportunity for you to make some investments in these technology companies, given your access and view on all of the new thoughts that are out there?","David P. King","Yes, Bob, we have made a number of investments over time and we'll continue to make them. We look at opportunities that we think are interesting from a technological perspective, opportunities that we think are interesting from a testing perspective and opportunities that we think are attractive from a strategic perspective. So we've had -- like most investors, we've had some successes and some failures. We had a couple of nice successes recently, and this will continue to be an important part of our strategy as we think about how we stay abreast of what's going on in the market.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","How many shots on goal, maybe just to help us think about the opportunity? I mean, are there 10 active investments or half that amount? I mean, how do we think about the potential opportunity?","Adam T. Feinstein","Bob, this as Adam. Just -- yes, I mean, if you think about any portfolio, we have several active investments. I don't want to give you a precise number, but from the range you gave, I'd say you're in the right ballpark. So you wouldn't look for us to have hundreds of things out there, so I think the ballpark you gave is accurate. And as Dave said, we continue to look for opportunities that create -- that are strategic for us, and we'll continue to think about that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy of William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just had a question on some of the dynamics that we haven't talked about in a little while. But in terms of hospitals buying doc practices and in-sourcing lab testing and then, generally, physicians in-sourcing testing and sort of general follow-up from the TC Grandfather Clause, just curious if you could update us on those 3 dynamics at this point.","David P. King","Amanda, it's Dave. I mean, I would say that health systems acquiring physicians is a continuing trend. I do think it's diminishing in the sense that a lot of those deals have been done and health systems are now trying to figure out exactly what they're going to do now that they've acquired these practices, and the doctors are trying to figure out what they're going to do. Physician in-sourcing continues to be a -- particularly around pathology, continues to be a theme. Again, I think the most significant part of that has abated, but it's still out there in the marketplace. TC Grandfather, in my mind, is done. It happened. We've absorbed the impact and we've moved on.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just as a follow-up to Kevin's question earlier on just long-term growth trends or rates in the industry. It used to be that you were able to drive a couple percentage points of revenue-per-req growth, just the mix shift to esoteric testing. I'm just curious, as you're launching some of these newer tests, is that a dynamic that we might see again, not necessarily that growth rate but just an impact from esoteric percentages going up over time?","David P. King","Yes, I think it is. I mean, we don't launch esoteric tests because they're esoteric or because of their price point. We launch them because they are clinically relevant and medically necessary. Certainly, there's the opportunity to see benefit from the mix there. As Brad mentioned, the wellness and pain management testing, while we still get a very nice margin from that testing, on a pure price perspective, is lower than our overall book. And the reductions that we've received from the government are pretty much unprecedented and that has a major impact on revenue per requisition, as well as on margin. So there are many puts and takes to pricing, and positive mix certainly is one of those things that is an opportunity in the mid to longer term.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then just last one on M&A. Obviously, that's been a driver for you guys for a while. I mean, how do think about that, too, in the longer term? That's something that, essentially with some of these pricing changes that are going on, do you see that being an avenue for growth over the longer term?","David P. King","Yes, I think as I said in the prepared remarks and said in response to an earlier question, M&A and acquisitions are going to be, I think, important for us going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci [ph] of FBR.","Unknown Analyst","I just had a couple of things I want to clarify real quick, and maybe one question after that. On the molecular -- on the impact of the molecular-related issues, do you describe that as sort of getting a little bit better or the same or getting worse versus, let's say, the last quarter?","David P. King","Tom, it's Dave. I think it's getting a little bit better.","Unknown Analyst","Little bit better, okay. I thought that's what you said. And then I don't know if I missed it, but was there any meaningful intra-quarter trend on volumes or particular volatility, as we've heard maybe some describe out there, that you saw?","David P. King","Tom, we don't talk about volumes within the quarter or trends within the quarter, so I'm not in a position to respond to that.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then just the last one, Dave. I know you've talked in the past about sort of diversifying revenue streams a bit, maybe a little bit away from government-oriented reimbursement, for good reason. MEDTOX clearly seems to have been a home run of a deal. As you think about the acquisition environment going forward, should we be thinking about acquisitions that are more skewed away from some of the core clinical testing that we've seen in the past and towards these other types of areas or even international? Or do you still expect it to sort of be a blend that you've done in the past?","David P. King","I think it'll be a blend. I mean, when we talk about the knowledge strategy and creating knowledge for health care stakeholders, that's how we think about the way that we can diversify revenue as, again, things like the Baroma relationship and BeaconLBS and other tools that we're developing. So I don't think about that as going out and buying non-lab assets for the purpose of diversifying revenue. Because one of the things I think we're good at is running laboratories and be careful about buying things that we're not good at just so we can get away from our traditional mix. Having said that, I look 5 years down the road and we certainly will be a more global company, we need to be. I mean, it's a global world and health care is a global business, and so we need to figure out how to participate more broadly in international markets. I don't foresee a big acquisition there but I foresee -- we do business in 40 countries today. I see the opportunity to expand that presence. And continuing to look for strategic opportunities within our own markets will be a very important part of long-term growth for us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted just to pick your brain a little bit, Dave, just get your thoughts on what business model you think is resonating the most within the hospital channel, just in terms of the offerings that you're bringing to market there. You obviously broadened your -- in Northern California. Do you think that's the primary mode of consolidation within that realm? Do you think JVs are too cumbersome for health systems? How's your ability to co-manage labs? Just want to get your thoughts in sort of what's resonating out there.","David P. King","I think there's a broad range of offerings for health systems, ranging from acquisition at the one end to JVs at the other end. I think health systems are becoming increasingly focused on what the financial characteristics of the laboratory are, particularly the capital needs required there and the space needs and how they can potentially deploy those assets more effectively within their core competencies. That means some will sell, some will ask us to manage their laboratories, some will just want to send us reference work. I agree with you, Darren. I think JVs with large health systems are complex, but that doesn't mean they can't be done, we have several. So from our perspective, it's the broadest -- the willingness to participate in the broadest range of potential offerings, the willingness to do what makes the most sense to the health system in terms of optimizing its ability to provide the highest quality lab services at the most effective cost.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I guess, the follow-up then would just be your -- or how different are the conversations today? I mean, you bring up capital and space constraints. Obviously, there's reimbursement issues perhaps down the road, but just the unit cost still is pretty different. So I'm curious how that conversation is changing, if at all, as you talk to health systems.","David P. King","Well, when I started 7 years ago, I'm sure everyone can remember that I was very, very optimistic about how the health system would -- how lab work would migrate from hospitals to independent labs. And 7 years later, I've relearned one of the great truths of health care, which is everything takes a lot longer than we think it will. So I just -- we're having constructive conversations. Hospitals and health systems are more capital constrained. They're seeing reimbursement come down. They, too, have been cut significantly by the government over the last 2-year cycle. And we're just going to continue to press ahead with this strategic focus. And ultimately, I think there's great opportunity for growth there.","Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. And then just my last question, really just to clarify your comments on BeaconLBS and the United arrangement. Congrats for signing that. The question here though is, is this something that will be part of a benefit design for 2014 or is this for the 2015 year? And if the latter, do you think you'll have more health plan customers signed up for the selling season for next year?","David P. King","We've said that we expect implementation in the latter part of 2014, and that's what we're going to say right now. And we'll provide you with further information over the next several quarters. So 2 minutes past the top of the hour here and we'd like to try to take everybody's questions. We do want wrap up though. So please, let's try to ask questions that haven't been asked and answered already and let's be brief.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'll be quick. My question was on margins. The margins probably came in a little bit lower than I would have thought on volumes that were probably a little bit stronger than I would have thought. And so I'm just kind of curious if you can give us a little bit more color on those margins and what your expectations are going forward.","William B. Hayes","Glen, it's Brad. For the reasons that we mentioned in the call that relate to revenue per requisition, as well as price, when we look through what's going on with the margins, those are the major drivers. So very much the reductions revenue, reductions that we've talked about, are the culprit there. And as Dave mentioned earlier, as we think about the opportunity over time, I mean, it has been a reimbursement challenge, as you know, for the reasons that we've mentioned. But we continue to believe that the margin characteristics of the business are attractive going forward, from driving standardization and innovation over our scale. So bumpy time from the reimbursement perspective, but it's there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dane Leone of Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","In the same vein as the previous question, but just thinking about the operating expense leverage that the business model has, I guess, in light of some of the innovations you're putting in automation and the labs going forward. As volumes, as organic volumes come back, hopefully supported by ACA in 2014, what's your kind of guess of how much variable costs will still need to come back on? I mean, I think you're operating from a fairly low volume perspective historically, so we would, I guess, expect to see some leverage there. Any color is helpful.","William B. Hayes","I think, again, it definitely relates to the reimbursement environment. But from a leverage and the cost perspective, I mean, we have the variable costs of the reagents and the supplies that we use. But our infrastructure is still there and visiting lots of accounts and picking up samples every day. So I think to the extent that can organically grow, there's a tremendous amount of leverage that's there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice of UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was going to ask you about maybe any comment you have, early days, obviously, but the Walgreens announcement to begin to try to offer clinical lab services through their retail outlets as part of their minute clinic type of approach. And I mean, they are talking about being disruptive to the clinical lab industry. How -- what do you think of that? And then also with the other retail drug chains that offer similar type of service, is there any opportunity for you to partner with any of them? Have you thought about that?","David P. King","It's Dave. So we have, in the past, had partnering relationships with a number of the in-store clinics. They're not economically very productive for us. The testing menu is extremely limited, the demand for when you come pick up specimens is high. And you end up sending a courier at an odd hour to pick up one specimen. It just -- that model is not a -- the in-store clinic model is an acute -- to me, is a model of you take care of an acute problem like an earache or a flu shot or something. It's not really like even an urgent care clinic, where there's a significant number of blood draws. With respect to Walgreens, my understanding is that what they're doing in this pilot, at least in the one store, is they're just going to have a phlebotomist there who's going to draw blood and send it to a reference lab, just like we do. And again, I think from the perspective of convenience, accuracy, cost, I still think that the reference lab model, in the long run, is going to be the most successful. So we're always aware of what others are doing and have interesting innovations, and we'll continue to watch this closely.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen of Raymond James & Associates.","Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Quick question on guidance. What's the primary delta between where your guidance is today relative to when you issued original guidance back in February? You've done over $750 million of buybacks, yet the midpoint of EPS is unchanged. So relative to your initial expectations, is the entire delta just the molecular pathology coding changes or is there something else there that's kind of not played out as you originally anticipated?","William B. Hayes","Nicholas, this is Brad. That is the delta, you've nailed it.","Operator","I would now like to hand the call back to David King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","David P. King","Thank you very much. Thank you, Clinton. In closing here today, obviously, we had a significant announcement about Brad's retirement. And I was reflecting with him yesterday afternoon, it's really a sad day for me. I remember what I first met Brad, and I think it was 1996, and since then, we have worked together on a professional and a personal level in an extraordinary way. Brad has been a phenomenal contributor to this company and to our industry in a period of great transformation. He was the head of billing here. When he came here, bad debt was 11%. We literally were struggling to get the bills out the door. And what we've accomplished with his leadership under -- as head of billing and as Chief Financial Officer when Wes stepped down is really exceptional. So I don't say this about a lot of people at LabCorp but Brad has been a stalwart here. And I know I speak for the whole team in saying we will really, really miss him deeply and wish him and his family well. And with that, we thank you for listening to our call and wish you a great day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your call for today. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to the Q2 2019 LabCorp Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to, Ms. Clarissa Willett, VP of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Clarissa Willett","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","This morning in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and Investor Relations' presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.","Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to estimated 2019 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on operating and financial results, expected savings and synergies and the opportunities for future growth.","Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change, based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent forms 10-Q, and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David King","Thank you, Clarissa, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing financial highlights of the second quarter. Our results in the quarter were again driven by strong demand across both businesses and consistent execution of our strategy to deliver world-class diagnostics, bringing new medicines to patients faster and use technology to change the way care is delivered.","We delivered another strong quarter across the enterprise, revenue of $2.9 billion was nominally an increase of 0.5% over last year, but this significantly understates the strength of our operational performance. Top line revenues from continuing operations grew 4%, decreased by 3 major nonoperational items, 1.9% of divestitures, 0.9% of PAMA impact and 0.7% of negative currency. We delivered excellent margin performance, given the impact from PAMA and adjusted EPS of $2.93. We also deployed $656 million for strategic acquisitions and $200 million to share repurchase.","Our Diagnostics business again performed well as our team continue this outstanding work, retaining volume put at risk by managed care contract changes. Revenue per requisition in the quarter, excluding divestitures was very strong, growing at 2.5% excluding the impact of PAMA. Despite PAMA and other headwinds, our organic volume, revenue per requisition and Diagnostics LaunchPad 2 initiatives combined to deliver an impressive 19.6% adjusted operating margin. ","Our priorities in Covance continue to be driving net quarters, converting backlog in to profitable revenue growth, capitalizing on strategic investment such as Envigo and focusing on our key initiatives, precision medicine, patient solutions, data is a differentiator and new global delivery models. Investments in our Covance team, end-to-end capabilities, therapeutic expertise and global infrastructure translated into over 6.8% revenue growth, margin expansion of 90 basis points over $10 billion of backlog and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.26. The backlog growth exceeding $10 billion for the first time is further evidence that our differentiated data driven offerings our resonating with existing clients and attracting new business.","Now I'll review the quarter's performance highlights. Our integrated Diagnostics and Drug Development capabilities and data continue to create value in innovative ways that our competitors cannot matched. I'll review several examples that showcase these capabilities. First, our unique virtual and hybrid trial capabilities bring together our Diagnostics PSC infrastructure, including LabCorp Walgreens locations, and logistics capabilities, as well as our Covance central labs, market access, project management, study design and data capabilities. These combined assets ease the patient burden of steady participation and deliver faster and more cost-effective trials for sponsors.","In the quarter, we won several new awards, including an 8-year Phase IIIb cell and gene therapy study, specifically designed to keep patients engaged over the lengthy timeline. The sponsors cited a unique ability to conduct blood draws at the LabCorp PSCs, deliver and track kits and samples, perform a full range of testing at Covance's central labs, provide patient support through the Covance market access business and deliver FDA compliance data in selecting LabCorp for this important opportunity. ","Second, we introduced our innovative new patient direct offering, streamlining patient recruitment by using LabCorp data in our direct connection to patients to quickly and effectively contact appropriate candidates for trials. Taking the sponsors criteria, we sent e-mails to a targeted set of patients likely to qualify for the study based on Diagnostics code, test results and geographic location. The emails referred the patient's to the sponsor's website to enroll, and they were then routed to a LabCorp service center for testing. We were compensated for each e-mail for the testing and for each enrolled patient. Based on the results of the initial campaign for our cardiovascular study, the sponsor has already significantly expanded the scope of this work. ","Third, Covance won a streaming and recruitment study for a very rare pediatric disease, where data from LabCorp Diagnostics, our recent MNG acquisition and other LabCorp partners combined to offer unique solution. Our capabilities here are unparalleled because they enable us to identify patients who are potentially eligible for the study, but may have been misdiagnosed and to screen them for definitive diagnosis of the condition and for study eligibility. Finally, we continue to advance our strong leadership position in companion diagnostics and in oncology with the introduction of 2 new companion diagnostic tests, PIK3CA for breast cancer and FGFR for bladder cancer.","Revenue from all aspects of companion diagnostics grew nearly 30% and orders more than doubled in the second quarter versus last year. These are among the growing number of proof points that our combined capabilities create unique and highly desired solutions for our customers' needs that only LabCorp can deliver. I'll now discuss this quarter's Diagnostics highlights. Our managed care portfolio continued to perform well. The business grew in the second quarter with United and Horizon volumes holding stable, and we won several important contracts in key markets.","As a reminder, all of our LabCorp brands are included in the UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network which went into effect on July 1. Although, we expect limited impact on the PLN in 2019, we are optimistic about the opportunity to grow volume with UnitedHealthcare through the PLN in 2020 and beyond. We continue to grow our hospital and health system revenue and deepen our relationships. In the quarter, we announced the Mount Sinai digital pathology and artificial intelligence collaboration, and finalized several other new relationships with NEL systems.","We continue to work to overcome the inequitable Medicare price reductions imposed by the flawed implementation of PAMA. We are encouraged by the introduction of the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act, significant step at reforming PAMA to produce a truly market-based Medicare fee schedule. The lab act would delay the second ramp of PAMA reporting to the first quarter of '21, and with commission to study by the National Academy of Medicine focused on having implement PAMA properly and deliver truly market-based reimbursement.","In the quarter, we continue to work on providing a seamless customer experience. Our LabCorp Walgreens partnership is on track to have at least 125 stores by the end of this year, including sites at new space at major metropolitan markets. We are on track to achieve our target at, at least 600 locations by 2022. We are also moving towards integrations of our locations and capabilities into each other's digital experiences and Walgreens Find Care platform, and continuing to discuss a broader collaboration on health and wellness offerings and the next-generation CRO.","We also add consumer initiated phlebotomy-based testing to Pixel by LabCorp. This new offering expands the number of testing options available to consumers and enhances access and convenience by giving them the option to have self-directed testing collected at LabCorp service centers or LabCorp Walgreens locations in states where Pixel is available. LaunchPad 2 continues to progress well in transforming our business. A significant number of projects are underway, including digitizing operations, expanding digital and mobile options available to our patients, increasing transparency for consumers and health care providers and streamlining all of our workflows.","We remain on track to deliver a transformed business and a total of $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021. Now I'll discuss Covance highlights in the quarter. On June 3, Covance completed the Envigo transaction, divesting our CRP business and enhancing the reach and scope of our nonclinical drug development business. This transaction infused the signs of talent and technical expertise into our nonclinical business and substantially increases global capacity with expanded footprint in Europe and the U.S. We are excited to welcome our new colleagues to Covance, as we focus on integrating our expanded capacity -- capabilities seamlessly. Recognizing our strength in Drug Development across the Covance business, a sponsor recently awarded us a full molecule development program, which included a preclinical toxicology study, a Phase I pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic study to be conducted in our clinical pharmacology unit and a large Phase II program, including 3 studies across two cardiovascular indications.","This award was driven by our regulatory expertise and our biomarker capabilities and demonstrates Covance's ability, unique among CROs to take drugs to early discovery through to FDA approval. Covance continues to improve its award-winning Xcellerate platform, which facilitates complete study quality management and risk based monitoring according to the IACH guidelines.","Recent additions include implementation of a company-wide risk library and deployment of the Xcellerate action alerts. These enhancements increase our capabilities in managing study risks and overall study quality, leading to improved safety for study subjects, more efficient trial operations and more effective use of study budgets. We continue to execute our Covance Launchpad initiative and are on track to deliver $150 million of net savings through Covance Launchpad initiatives by the end of 2020.","We completed the $30 million in cost synergies from the integration of Chiltern that we committed to deliver in 2020 and expect to achieve $10 million in net cost synergies from the integration of Envigo by the end of 2021. In coalition, we are pleased with our second quarter performance. When we acquired Covance, we knew that the power of the combined would result in a differentiated offering that would position us to become a unique global life sciences company. That decision reflected our strategic vision for the company's future, our established commitment to playing the long game and our confidence in our exceptional team of colleagues around the world dedicated to caring for patients. We are seeing our vision for the combined enterprise become increasingly to life as we pursue our mission of improving health and improving lives.","Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with the review of our second quarter results, followed by discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our 2019 guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, an increase of 0.5% over last year. The increase was primarily due to organic revenue growth of 1.7% and acquisitions of 1.4%, partially offset by divestitures of 1.9% and foreign currency translation of 70 basis points. Excluding the negative impact from PAMA of 90 basis points, organic revenue grew 2.6%. Operating income for the quarter was $336 million or 11.6% of revenue compared to $369 million or 12.9% last year. ","During the quarter, we had $51 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to Launchpad initiatives and acquisition integration. Adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization of $60 million as well as restructuring charges and special items, was $447 million or 15.5% of revenue compared to $464 million or 16.2% last year. The decline in adjusted operating income and margin was due to the impact from PAMA of $27 million, higher personal costs and cybersecurity expenses partially offset by organic demand and Launchpad savings.","The tax rate for the quarter was 29.4% compared to 25.1% last year. The adjusted tax rate, excluding special charges and amortization, was 25.2% compared to 24.5% last year. The higher adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the mix of earnings. We continue to expect the company's adjusted tax rate for the full year to be between 25% and 26%. Net earnings for the quarter were $190 million or $1.93 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and other special items, were $2.93 in the quarter, down 2% compared to last year.","Operating cash flow was $254 million in the quarter compared to $387 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher working capital requirements to support growth. Capital expenditures totaled $85 million or 3% of revenue compared to $87 million or 3% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $160 million in the quarter compared to $300 million last year. We remain on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance of $950 million to $1.05 billion in 2019.","We remained active throughout the quarter in terms of capital allocation. During the quarter, we invested $656 million in acquisitions and repurchased $200 million of stock. As of June 30, we had $1.05 billion of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. At quarter end, our cash balance was $265 million, down from $349 million at the end of the first quarter. Total debt at quarter end was $6.6 billion and our leverage was 3.4x gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA.","Now I'll review our segment performance beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, a decrease of 2.9% compared to last year, due to divestitures of 2.8%, foreign currency translation and organic revenue, partially offset by acquisitions. Organic revenue was down 0.3% in the quarter, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 1.5% and fewer revenue days of 0.6%.","Total volume excluding divestitures decreased by 0.9% from last year due to the decline in organic volume of 1.2% partially offset by acquisitions of 0.2%. Organic volume was reduced by approximately 2.5% due to the combination of lower consumer genetics demand, managed care contract changes and fewer revenue days. Excluding these items, organic volume was up 1.3%. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 1.8% to our volume growth. Revenue per requisition, excluding the impact from divestitures, increased by 1% due to mix. Revenue per requisition was negatively impacted by 150 basis points from PAMA.","LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $345 million or 19.6% of revenue compared to $376 million or 20.7% last year. The $31 million decline in adjusted operating income was primarily due to PAMA of $27 million. The negative impact from divestitures, managed care contract changes, cybersecurity expenses, fewer revenue days and personnel cost was essentially offset by Launchpad savings, other organic revenue growth and acquisitions. We remain on track to deliver $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021 from our Diagnostics Launchpad initiative.","Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 6.8% compared to last year due to organic growth of 5.5% and acquisitions of 3.3% partially offset by foreign currency translation of 1.6% and divestitures of 0.3%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $142 million or 12.6% of revenue compared to $123 million or 11.7% last year. The $18 million increase in adjusted operating income and 90 basis point improvement in margins were primarily due to organic demand, Launchpad savings, acquisitions and currency translation, partially offset by higher personnel costs, cybersecurity investment, and facility expenses to support the Company's global expansion. We remain on track to deliver $150 million of net savings by the end of 2020 from Covance's Launchpad initiatives. For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remain strong at $5.5 billion and 1.26, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $10.3 billion, an increase of approximately $350 million from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.1 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","Now I'll discuss our 2019 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of June 30, for the remainder of the year and includes the impact from currently anticipated deployment of free cash flow toward acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment.","We expect revenue growth of 1% to 2% over 2018 revenue of $11.3 billion, a narrowing of the range as compared to our prior guidance of 0.5% to 2.5%. This guidance includes the negative impact from divestitures of 1.5% and foreign currency translation of 50 basis points. We expect LabCorp Diagnostics revenue to be down 3% to down 2% as compared to 2018 revenue of $7 billion, this is an improvement over our prior guidance of down 4% to down 2%, primarily due to organic performance. This guidance includes the negative impact from divestitures of approximately 2% and foreign currency translation of 20 basis points.","We expect Covance Drug Development revenue growth of 5.5% to 8.5% over 2018 revenue of $4.3 billion, a narrowing of the range as compared to our prior guidance of 5% to 9%. This guidance includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $11.10 to $11.40, which is an increase of 1% to 3% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS of $11.02, and a narrowing of our range as compared to our prior guidance of $11.05 to $11.45.","Free cash flow was expected to be $950 million to $1.05 billion, which is an increase of 3% to 13% over 2018 and unchanged from our prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","I wanted to maybe talk a little bit about the lab business in the quarter. And was hoping if you could break out for us within the 2.5%, what the impact in the quarter was from some of the managed care access changes versus the consumer genetics? And just given some of the noise on the consumer genetic side, just, what's built into the second half in terms of in and back and the comps in the fourth quarter?","David King","Yes, it's Dave. So in terms of the consumer genetics business, the volume for the second quarter was down about 1.1% versus last year. It's the first time we've actually seen a volume decline, but as we have for chatter free over the last couple of quarters, we had said, we expected consumer genetics volume to be flat to down or for the balance of '19, that is built into the guidance. In terms of the changes in managed care access, we've not broken that number specifically, but what I'd say was basically flat from first quarter to second quarter, and the typical thing that you'd be interested in United and Horizon volumes basically remain stable and at the volumes increase a little bit for us. So broadly the managed care book did increase overall in terms of revenue and volume, but those 3 key components basically remained stable for the quarter.","Jack Meehan","Great. Also had two quick follow-ups on Covance. Is there any color you can provide...","David King","You set the precedence right here right now this morning. Use your...","Jack Meehan","Okay. So, appreciate Dave, also want to say congrats and see you in a few weeks.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you, Jack.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore.","Suzie Yoon","It's Suzie on for Ross. I guess just honing in on consumer genomics, what are your expectations for when those volumes could bounce back post 2019? And was the low demand a function of just 1 or 2 partners or the overall DTC genomics market?","David King","First of all, Jack, you're still entitled to one follow-up, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off completely, just to save one follow-up. In answer to the question on consumer genomics, we're not guiding into 2020, what we've set for the balance of 2019 as we expect consumer genetics volume to be flat to down. As you know, we have one primary partner in the consumer genetics business, which is 23andMe. So I think it's a fair inference that, that's where the volume decline is coming from. And in terms of what the future of the consumer genetics business looks like, our assumption is that it's going to be flat to down for the foreseeable future.","Suzie Yoon","Got it. And as a follow-up, around 23andMe, is there any color you can provide around 23andMe post some promotional periods we just passed?","David King","No. The only guidance I can give you on 23andMe is what I responded in the prior question, which is, last year, we were slightly up in the first quarter, this year, we're down in the second quarter, we expect volumes to be flat to down for the balance of the year.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","I accept the follow-up question. Wanted to focus on Covance, just any color you can provide on how pass-throughs might have impacted revenue in the quarter? And a follow-up to the follow-up is, with patient direct, how broad of a patient for do you think you can now address with that?","John Ratliff","On pass-throughs, Jack, this is John, it was -- pass-throughs were up this quarter and at the same time comparable to the organic growth that we stated in constant currency at 5.5% level. So we didn't have the anomaly that we had in first quarter.","David King","And patient direct, Jack, it's Dave, the issue is where the sponsor comes to us with criteria that fit well within the items that we highlighted, which is geographic location, diagnosis codes and lab results. But the potential opportunity there is very significant because, part of what is a differentiator in terms of winning studies is that we have been -- Covance capabilities of protocol optimization combined with the ability to look at LabCorp data and see as you're optimizing the protocols, where your patients show most likely to be and where you're going to, so to speak, what ponds you're going to catch the most fishes. So we're excited about the patient direct and expect that it's going to continue to be a growing area. And as mentioned, we get compensated for each email that we send for the lab testing that we do and then for each patient that enrolls in the study.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","Dave, I just want to talk about the competitive landscape and some recent news around shifts in some competitive capitated contracts, said, I would presume shifted to LabCorp from Quest. When I look at your revenue per req being up 2.5% versus last year, it doesn't seem to really dive with what we heard around pricing. So really just 2 questions there. One, how do we think about the competitive landscape today? And two, how do we think about the actual profitability of this piece of business that shifted?","David King","Well, the competitive landscape is the same as it's always been, which is, Quest is an excellent competitor, I like to think of ourselves as an excellent competitors. There are other excellent competitors in the market as well. And of course, we have to build in competition of health systems, which have the ability to actually own providers in direct business internally, which is something that is not an option available to us. So the competitive landscape remains challenging, but it's no more challenging than it's been in my career. It's -- we're out there competing every single day. On the specific question about the contracts, I would just say, I think when you win the contract, it's always on quality and service, and when you lose a contract, it's always on price. So I would discount somewhat the observations around pricing and profitability and those things. And what I would point to is our revenue per requisition is up 1%, ex PAMA and 2.5%, including PAMA, our adjusted operating income was 19.6%, $27 million of the $31 million in decline in operating income versus last year was due to PAMA. That to me does not indicate aggressive price cutting, here at LabCorp, and we have been very disciplined around pricing. We continue to be disciplined around pricing, and I'm not going to comment on specific contracts, but I am going to say that, we don't go out and solicit and win business that is bad business or that is below our profitability or our price -- per revenue per requisition expectations. We haven't done it and we're not going to start doing it now.","Lisa Gill","That's very helpful. And then just my follow up would be, Glenn, you talked about cash flow, acquisitions, share repurchase, paying down debt. Do you have specific things in the pipeline around acquisitions that we should be thinking about for the back half of the year? Or is that just kind of the general language of these are the kind of three things that we look at?","Glenn Eisenberg","I think it's, yes, on both if you will, I mean, we have generated the bulk of our free cash flow in the second half of the year. We did lever up a little bit, obviously, with the Envigo acquisition, so part of our free cash flow will be used to pay down debt in the second half. But we don't have obviously a lot of financial flexibility to continue to pursue tuck-in acquisitions as well as be in the market repurchasing share. So the acquisition pipeline continues to be good across both businesses as we evaluate opportunities. And I think it's fair to assume that without, obviously, saying that, we will do transactions but that part of that capital in the second half could go to tuck-in acquisitions as well.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric Coldwell","I just had a technical question on the calendar. I think this is the third quarter in the row where you've talked about calendar headwinds, revenue day headwinds. Can you tell us what exactly is going on there? And how does the calendar shake out for the rest of this year? And maybe I could allow the future request that we get revenue days or calendar day so analysts can be more thoughtful about modeling this going forward?","David King","Yes, Eric, it's Dave. So when we calculate the calendar, obviously, there's the same number of days every year, but what's important to us is the strength of days. So Mondays are not strong days, Saturdays are not strong days, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are stronger days, and obviously then there's the impact of holidays and three holiday days. So it's not quite as simple as saying there's so many days in this month and so many days in that month. It's how many Tuesdays and Wednesdays fall in a particular month versus Sundays and Mondays.","That said, every year, we look at the calendar and we calculate the strength of the total revenue days across the year. In the first quarter of this year, we were about a half a day below the first quarter of 2018. In this quarter, we're about a half a day below the second quarter of 2018. In the third quarter, the number of days will be identical year-over-year and the fourth quarter, we'll have the benefit of one more revenue day.","So that is the calendar for the balance of the year, and we will consider your request to give you more insight earlier in the year on the strength of the calendar and come back to you on that.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS.","Kevin Caliendo","I wanted to talk about the Diagnostic margin, it was a lot better than what we had modeled. You called out LaunchPad, can you talk specifically about the incremental savings that you got from LaunchPad in the quarter? And how we should be thinking about the diagnostic margin going forward?","David King","Yes, I'll let Glenn start on that, then I'll add any comments that I might have.","Glenn Eisenberg","Sure. Yes. Kevin, what we actually talk about is the total Launchpad initiative over the three years and the $200 million that we expect to realize, and we basically said, use a pro rata for each of the 3 years of the program. But the reality is as we do ramp up as we go throughout the program. So we don't quantify how much impact it has in any particular quarter, but clearly, when we talk about the headwinds that we had and how well Diagnostics performed, one of the key drivers to the performance was all the Launchpad initiatives that will continue to benefit. As we think about the Diagnostics margins for the year, what we said was that, if you will, the second -- the decline in margins year-on-year is there, given the significant impact of PAMA. But that we expect to see less of a year-over-year decline as the year progresses because LaunchPad's ramping up. So even though margins will be down in the second half year-over-year, they will be down less than they were in the first half year-on-year, and obviously, yes, improvements expected as we get into 2020.","David King","And I would just say, agree with everything Glenn said. I think it's also important to recognize that a lot of what LaunchPad is about is more than just near-term savings. So the business transformation from the digitization of the business and the streamlining of workflows is an ongoing savings for our business out in 2021 and beyond because we're able to do more without adding new heads, because we we're able to redeploy the people that we have for customer facing position. So there's a pretty profound element of business transformation here that I don't want to lose sight of and that has greater long-term benefits than just the near-term cost savings.","Kevin Caliendo","Got it. And just a quick follow-up on Envigo. I know it was only in for a short period of time. But was there any impact on bookings, book-to-bill? Any of that kind of stuff as you brought it on?","John Ratliff","Kevin, this is John. So it was only in there for one month, so a nominal effect. So as you know, in the early development area that has a quicker burn on the revenue side, a little bit lower book-to-bill but have nominal effect on the quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rivka Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Rivka Goldwasser","So Dave, you seemed more positive today on the opportunity from United preferred lab network. So when you think about the restrictions that United put in place that requires providers to do certain things to go out of network. Is this came out better than what you expected? And how should we think about that opportunity for next year?","David King","As I said in my prepared remarks, I think that impact this -- we're not expecting or factoring into guidance any significant impact from the PLN in 2019, just because of the start up and the times it's going to take providers to become adjusted to the restrictions. I think the requirements that United has at least talk about for what they would ask providers to do before they go out of network are positive. For those of us who are in the network, I think, as we said for long-term, the real long-term opportunity is in benefit design and it's also in creating appropriate incentives for patients and for positions to use the more efficient lower cost providers versus referring either out of network or to higher cost providers who are in the network.","So I'm pleased with the initiative that United is taking. I'm pleased with the collaborative way, which they are talking to us and to the industry about how we can use the PLN as a device to improve quality and reduce cost of lab services. And I'm hopeful that in 2020, we're going to see some nice benefit from it.","Rivka Goldwasser","Okay. And then my follow-up is in an earlier comment, you said that the volumes from United and Horizon kind of like, stabilized 1Q to 2Q. I think that in the first quarter, you mentioned that the impact -- the negative impact was about 70 basis points on volume growth. So should we assume 70 basis points this quarter as well?","David King","I would say, approximately, I mean, we're not going to give the basis point by basis point. But it was in that ballpark of the 70 basis points and not materially different from what we saw in the first quarter. As we said, Ricky, we expected the major impact to be in the first quarter and that's how it's played out for us.","Glenn Eisenberg","Ricky, another way to kind of get to the number a little bit, if you will is we talked about the three big headwinds on the volume accounted for roughly 2.5% headwind. We quantify the daily impact of 60 basis points in our opening remarks, Dave, commented about consumer genetics being around 1%. So you can get to the managed care impact of the comp around 1% as well a little bit below.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Daniel Leonard","May be a quick clarification on that last point, Glenn. What was consumer genetics volume down 1%? Or was the headwind from the consumer genetics volume decline 1%, meaning that the business was down a lot more than that?","Glenn Eisenberg","No, the consumer genetics volume was down 1.1% versus last year.","Daniel Leonard","Okay. And I want to spend my follow-up on that. So I have a quick follow-up here. Dave, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you had important contract wins in key markets, can you elaborate? Or are these contracts with managed care companies, contracts with physician networks or hospitals, fee-for-service were capitated, any elaboration would be helpful?","David King","Yes, they were a couple of managed care contracts, and yes, I'm not going to go into the detail of every contract, but the reason we felt they were in key markets was that they were in markets where we probably felt that our exposure from the contract changes with United and Horizon were greater. So they helped to reinforce the strength of the business there. There were also a couple of health system transactions and as well the expansion of the Mount Sinai, a partnership to sort of another line of growth with the artificial intelligence of the digital pathology collaboration.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","David King","Before we do this, I just -- I want to correct a misstatement that I made just moments ago which is the 1.1% negative for consumer genetics was negative to volume for the business. It was not the consumer genetics year-over-year. I want to make sure I'm saying this right. So when we look at the organic volume being down, right, it was 60 basis points for the year-over-year comparison of days, 1.1% for consumer genetics and the balance being the managed care, so about 0.8% on the managed care, right? So that's how we got to the down number. So it wasn't the delta just within consumer genetics, that was the drag on the overall volume for the business, I'm sorry, I misstated that.","Erin Wright","Okay, thanks, that's helpful, this is Erin. At Covance -- switching gears to the Covance, I guess, what inning would you say that we're in, in terms of better leveraging the data asset, the cost of CRO platform and then cost of Diagnostics platform. I guess, it's still relatively early. But you did highlight several examples in the prepared remarks. And I'm just curious if you could quantify or characterize with those, how the win rate is improving? How you're leveraging kind of some of the diagnostic you feel these data assets in? And also kind of, are you winning customers that you haven't worked with before on the CRO side?","John Ratliff","Yes, Erin, this is John. From the standpoint of any what inning, we'll call it in the -- right in the game, it is fourth inning, let's say, and from the beginning point of -- data is mandated in every deal that we do. And so when we win, that is based on, yes, data. But it's also based on the quality of the team, so quality of the medics, project management, et cetera. So there's multiple factors of why you win. From the standpoint of -- we potentially are going to be continuing to be in the middle of the game, only because we're looking at more data, more -- we're -- world data, more international data, looking at very specifically additional data. When you get into the oncology areas, you need additional data and that being the majority of our portfolio.","So the strength of our data is a myth. You have the worldwide nature of the central lab data and then the very specific capabilities of the Diagnostics data, and having that $2.5 million assessments of week, that we can analog. So the data is tremendous. We feel capabilities have increased and continue to increase and we'll be looking at additional data to enable the business wins that we have had, but we'll have in the future.","Erin Wright","Okay, thanks. And a quick follow-up. I guess, just digging to underlying test mix dynamics. What meaningfully influence kind of that revenue per req in the quarter?","David King","Erin, it's Dave. So we have strength in the non-consumer genetics. So genetics broadly not noninvasive prenatal testing. We have strength in allergy and we have strength in oncology, which was a nice trend over what previously has been sort of a flat business, the oncology business is trending up, a lot of that having to do with the companion diagnostics capabilities. We had strength in women's health and we had some strength in medical growth monitoring. So broadly, the Esoteric Testing base performed very well and that benefited us in terms of our mix.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly","Maybe just one for John, on the Covance side, just looking at the back half ramp, can you just talk to the moving pieces there? I mean, obviously, Envigo rolls in, but in order to get to maybe the midpoint or even top ends, obviously, digging in some pretty nice growth in the back half. Can you just talk through confidence level there in the moving pieces?","John Ratliff","Yes. Confidence is there, Patrick. It's the combination of organic demand, yes, to your point acquisitions, but it's also that you have less currency headwinds in the second half of the year. So it's really enabled by those three things, the backlog of $10 billion, as Glenn stated, the 40% of the backlog in terms of line of sight tactically. And then clearly, the acquisitions kick in as well as then the currency based on today's currencies, you wouldn't see as much headwinds as you've seen in the first half.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. And then maybe just one for Glenn, just on the margin cadence, staying on the Covance business, again Envigo coming in there. Can you just talk through the back half, how we should expect the margins to trend, obviously, the cost savings initiatives are really taking hold. But maybe just talk through again the moving pieces there with the M&A coming in and how we should expect it to trend?","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. Now you kind of hit on the points, we expect to see a nice improvement in margins in the second half of the year driven off of the organic growth in the business and the Launchpad initiatives that are kicking in. The acquisition of Envigo will mix up our margin as well as we have a full second half of the year with it.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe","Dave, those contract win that you mentioned, can you just give us a sense of when they were won, and was there an impact to volume in the second quarter? And or is that more of a back half story?","David King","I believe one of them, Ralph, took effect February 1, and one on the March 1, there was a little bit of impact at the end of the first, but I would say most of the impact started in the second quarter. So it's going to continue to ramp throughout the year, but it's in the numbers.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And any, I mean, I guess is there any sense of the size of those, I mean, is there capitative contracts? I guess, the argument is there's a lot more, sort of, volume not as sort of revenue per req? Or any more insights there?","David King","Well, I think you guys are referring that the contracts that our competitors have talked about the contracts that we won, and I honestly, don't know the answer to that question because they didn't specify the contracts. But what I will say is, if you look at the revenue per requisitions number for the quarter and you look at the volume number for the quarter, it doesn't suggest to me that there is anything that's going to have a significant impact one way or the other for the balance of the year either on the volume or on the price.","Ralph Giacobbe","Fair enough. And then obviously there's been the opening of the Aetna and United contracts and sort of this all you mean a see change. But then we hear about sort of the competitiveness of the market. So are the United and Aetna contracts more of, sort of the one-off nationals doing this but more sort of a status quo within regional contracts where there's just more exclusivity and that's just the way it's going to be?","David King","I think it's hard to generalize because, for example, Horizon, which is a regional contract opened up on the other hand before the blue contract, it's still exclusive and we're not participating in it. So I think, the regional plans because of the concentration of where the patients are located and because of the not having a need for a broad national network probably have more openness to exclusive contracts. But I would also say, I think the trend is -- the trend increasingly is how do we optimize the network to get the highest quality for our patients at a favorable price point.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] on for Derik today. Just wanted to ask, what's the updated outlook for early-stage versus late-stage growth on the CRO side overall as an industry trend?","John Ratliff","I think from the standpoint of -- this is John, the late-stage versus early-stage, most analysts have the early-stage in and around the 4.5% to 5% growth, with the later-stage the industry growth is a little bit higher than that in 5% to 7% range. We see just based on the RP flows, proposal flows, actually nice growth in both areas as well as even on our central labs. So we see pipeline strong.","Unidentified Analyst","That's very helpful, John. Just as follow-up also on the Covance side. Wanted to see what's the net book-to-bill for the quarter? And if there's any pass-through impact on revenues and bookings?","John Ratliff","The bookings regularly shift between the quarters so we're focused on trailing 12-month period versus the quarterly. We expect to continue to deliver, and we did that in terms of 1.26x. What I will say is that we've been remarkably consistent raising from around 1.24x to 1.26x over the last 4 quarters. And our service may seem to a little bit more heavily to the faster burning business than some of our competitors. So clearly, a slow burning work can provide a boost to bill and it won't take out the revenue generation. But we've been, as I said before, consistent with that 1.24x to 1.26x over the last four quarters.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich","Dave. Two quick question. So first, you guys announced the Mount Sinai digital pathology in AI deal and then you also recently announced the path AI strategic investment. Just, could you give us a little bit more color on how big that opportunity is? And how much you think that could add to the growth over time? And then the second question is about Pixel and how big that is for you guys now and also where do see that going?","David King","Sure, Kevin. I'll start with the artificial intelligence. So this is -- the digital pathology is a long-term, I think significant opportunity in terms of both the improvement of the quality of care and the optimization of our pathology resources. I don't think we're going to see any material near-term impact, the idea with Mount Sinai is to introduce digital pathology, do side-by-side comparisons with actual pathologist, see how we optimize the use of digital pathology in routine pathology and are able to direct the pathologist towards the more complex and difficult cases. So I would say, long-term, I do see digital pathology expanding broadly across the laboratory business. But I -- and there is a significant opportunity to better allocate and deploy resources, I don't see any major impact in the near term and in terms of path AI, we continue to be very interested in all forms of artificial intelligence and machine learning that will help with diagnosis, if I remember was more than 10 years ago when we introduced image-guided path, which, in those days, was thought to be and was, I mean, a very dynamic change in the market from the traditional way of looking at path sphere. So it takes time for these innovations to take hold and to transform the business, but they are transformational over time. ","On Pixel, it's not material right now. The self-collection devices, we continue to refine our abilities around the self-collection device. We view this self-collection device over time as a very important tool for our health system partners, for care of patients in the home. But the big initiative this quarter was to get the Pixel offering into the patient service centers where consumers can go, they can self-direct testing, they can get the results in a separate secure website, they can do as they choose with those results. So if there is a health and wellness component. There are multiple reasons why people may want to get their testing done that doesn't come back through their primary care physician or through their insurance company. And what we're trying to do is, as we've said, we're a number of years now -- we're trying to meet the consumer where they want to be met and serve them in the way that they want to be served. I think the long-term opportunity with the consumer direct testing is quite significant for us.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Bryan Ross","This is Bryan Ross on for Brian. Maybe sticking with the consumer side. I want your thoughts on the Walgreens retail strategy and maybe pressing out on the centers side. What's the thought process on the pace of center development and where those ultimately end up being located, if that more just for consumers may not have easy access to lap concurrently? Or the other regions such as may be aligned to certain peer population and as a follow-up, you discussed on the other areas where you can collaborative with Walgreens. So just want to hear your thoughts there and if anything's progressed on that front over the last couple months?","David King","Sure. As I said, Ron, we're on track for 200 stores by the end of 2020 and 600 over time. The goal is, again, meet the consumer where the consumer wants to be met. And so part of the rationale for Walgreens centers is places where we feel that we don't have the density of patient service centers, the density of access points or the convenience that we would like to have. Part of it is our ability to draw patients who are -- who have other needs and then we do market research on the patients in the stores, we find that I think, the numbers about a quarter of them buying something else at Walgreens or fill up prescription at Walgreens so that's an important reason why they may choose Walgreens versus a standalone patient service center.","And we have a great partnership with Walgreens. We are -- we and talk with them regularly. We have senior executive meeting just this week and talked about the opportunities ahead. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, the integration of our digital and mobile experiences, and the integration of LabCorp capabilities into Walgreens Find Care now, we think is great step forward and gives us yet more opportunity for exposure and for patients being aware of the collaboration opportunity there. And then on the next-generation CRO, we have some very specific things that we're working on that I'm quite enthusiastic about it, and will have more to talk about with those in the next couple of quarters ahead.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair.","Matthew Larew","I wanted to ask about capital deployment, last quarter, John mentioned that following the Envigo transaction, you felt good about the capabilities on the Covance side and then obviously, alluded to some nice new contract wins this quarter, the leverages capabilities so in light of those comments, just wondering how you're viewing your pipeline both on the Covance side as well as on the diagnostic side, and where you think you can use that capabilities across the enterprise?","David King","Yes, as Glenn mentioned, the pipeline is robust. When we think about adding capabilities, we've said many times, we always look at the strategic bit, that's the number one thing and then we look at the financial criteria.","To me there's no area in which we are significantly deficient in terms of the market. We always look on the diagnostics side as where we can increase our critical mass, are there tests out there? Or capabilities out there, the MNG acquisition, for example, small deal but very significant for us because it significantly increased our capabilities around nextgen sequencing and our ability to bring nextgen sequencing and genetic testing to market rapidly.","So and on the Covance side, John, would say, always looking at building strength in Asia Pac and gaining more critical mass there but there's no area -- we're gonna look at every opportunity as, does it fit strategically, is it financially attractive, does it give us the appropriate returns and we'll choose among a very robust pipeline in that way.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Massaro","Dave, you talked about the oncology offerings showing growth. Can you provide some examples of where you're seeing the strongest growth? I asked given that there seems to be a renaissance in the precision medicine, liquid biopsy space, on the cancer monitoring and the MRD detection side, and I'm curious to see to what extent LabCorp's looking to drive innovation in this space relative to some other really strong lab companies moving the needle?","David King","Yes, we've been very involved, Mark, in liquid biopsy actually for a number of years going back to the Covance, you've seen us using them in the Covance business as innovative ways of looking at cancer trials. I think a lot of the strength that we're showing is in commercialization of companion diagnostics, again that are developed for Covance trials, or developed across the Covance business and then commercialized. And then what I would describe is, sort of more traditional oncology flow cytometry. I think, it's really important to recognize that the genetics of cancer becoming -- are becoming much better understood and so we're seeing genetic testing around tumors, we're seeing testing around sequencing of tumors, all is well. So it's a nice broad base of growth area that highlights the combined capabilities of LabCorp Covance as well as the ones stop shop it can be obtained by doing business with LabCorp because of our capabilities due to the oncology, due to genetics, due to routine blood counts and other tests that are required as part of the oncology treatment, and also look at recurrence and look at tumor burden and other aspects of the continuing course of patient care.","Mark Massaro","And then my related question, going back to direct to consumer genetic testing, some people that we've talked to have a view that DTC was great for ancestry testing, but has limitations for health given perhaps the lack of utility around array genotyping. Do you have a view about how this space potentially -- how this market could evolve and perhaps, whether it's a technology transfer more to sequencing?","David King","My view is that the consumer genetics market is a market that consumers are very interested in. As you say, there's been a -- there was a lot of interest in sort of the ancestry side of it or the genealogy side of it. It is more complex with health. I think some of the consumer genetics companies have done a very impressive job in getting the FDA to approve health based claims and to be able to educate consumers on those health based claims. I think, the real question is, to what extent our consumer's going to -- our consumer's going to adopt direct consumer genetic testing for health based as opposed to genealogy based purposes and I think that's a question that remains to be answered. I do agree obviously, that the -- that there would be benefits from moving more from array analysis to sequencing, but the other side of that is, when you do a sequence, there are so many things that are not known and so much opportunity for that confusion or uncertainty that I think it's just going to really be years before we know what the long-term future of the consumer genetics movement is. Operator, I think we're out of question.","Operator","Yes sir, we are. You may proceed with your closing remarks.","David King","Very well. Well, thank you for joining us this morning again. Very pleased with the strong performance this quarter and particularly, I want to highlight that we have more and more proof of points about the power of the combined enterprise in the way in which LabCorp and Covance are delivering unique solutions.

My name is Glenn, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. David King. Please proceed, sir.","David King","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Joining me today from LabCorp are Brad Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Steve Anderson, Vice President, Investor Relations.","This morning, we will discuss our first quarter 2014 financial results, update 2014 guidance, highlight our progress on our five-pillar strategy and provide answers to several frequently asked questions.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Steve Anderson who has a few comments before we begin.","Steve Anderson","Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and internet. Please refer to today\u2019s press release for replay information.","This morning, the company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information. Additionally, we refer you to today\u2019s press release, which is available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today\u2019s call to GAAP.","These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS excluding amortization, free cash flow and adjusted operating income. I would also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions.","These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the company\u2019s financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2013 10-K and will be included in subsequent filings with the SEC. The company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now Brad Hayes will review our financial results.","Brad Hayes","Thank you, Steve. On today\u2019s call, I will review 4 key measures of our financial performance: Cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. I\u2019ll also update our 2014 guidance.","First, cash flow. Our cash flow continues to be solid. Operating cash flow for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, was $142.3 million. We estimate that weather had a negative impact on operating income and a corresponding impact on cash flow of $32 million.","DSO at the end of March was 52 days, which was up 3 days sequentially and up 2 days year-over-year. We continue to experience claims being subject to higher deductibles and co-insurance. Accordingly, we raised bad debt by 25 basis points in the quarter and continued to focus on initiatives to improve patient collections.","Second, revenue growth. Revenue decreased 0.7% year-over-year in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of weather, revenue would have grown approximately 2% compared to last year. During the quarter, total company volume increased 2.6% excluding the impact of weather, volume growth would have been approximately 5% and organic volume would have increased approximately 2.5% year-over-year.","Revenue per acquisition decreased 3.3% year-over-year primarily accounted for by Medicare payment reductions, text mix and the Canadian business. It is important to note that managed care revenue per acquisition was flat sequentially.","Third, margin. For the first quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 14.7% compared to 18.7% in the first quarter of 2013. During the first quarter, weather reduced the company\u2019s margins by approximately 180 basis points.","Fourth, liquidity. We remain well-capitalized. At the end of March, we had cash of $338.9 million and no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion credit facility. During the first quarter, we repurchased $106.2 million of stock, representing 1.1 million shares.","At the end of March, approximately $946.3 million of repurchased authorization remained under our share repurchase program. Our share repurchase activity during the first quarter reflects our continued disciplined capital allocation program and commitment to return capital to our shareholders.","Despite losing $42 million of revenue and $0.22 of earnings to weather in the first quarter, we raised our 2014 earnings guidance. Our updated guidance is for revenue growth of approximately 2%.","Adjusted EPS excluding amortization of $6.40 to $6.70. Operating cash flow of approximately $780 million to $820 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $185 million to $205 million. The guidance excludes the impact of any share repurchase activity after March 31, 2014.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dave.","David King","Thank you, Brad. We are pleased with our first quarter results. During the quarter, we delivered volume growth of 2.6% excluding the impact of weather, volume growth would have been 5% and organic volume would have increased approximately 2.5% year-over-year. We continue to execute well on our key growth initiatives.","Although our revenue per requisition was down 3.3% year-over-year, managed care revenue per requisition was flat sequentially. During the first quarter, inclement weather negatively impacted revenue by an estimated $42 million and EPS by approximately $0.22, yet we raised our full-year 2014 earnings guidance.","In addition to our continued development of Beacon LBS, we significantly expanded the fifth pillar of our strategy by introducing Enlightened Health during the first quarter.","I would now like to update our progress on each aspect of our five-pillar strategy. The first pillar of our strategy is that we deploy capital to investments to enhance our business and return capital to shareholders.","We repurchased $106.2 million of stock during the first quarter, representing 1.1 million shares. Our share repurchase brings us almost to our stated target leverage ratio of 2.5 times debt to EBITDA and demonstrates our continued commitments to return capitals to shareholders.","Our acquisition pipeline remains robust and acquisition should continue to provide an attractive way to expand our test menu and geographic footprint for several years. We will maintain a disciplined approach to valuation as we seek optimal strategic opportunities.","The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. We continue to see strong customer adoption of our Enlightened Healthcare Intelligence platform for managing practice and population health data.","This platform helps clients unify the multiple components of population health management, providing primary care physicians with complete access to their patient\u2019s healthcare picture, rules for monitoring gaps and care and reporting that addresses more than 600 quality measures.","Enlightened Healthcare Intelligence, helps providers reduce expenses, improve outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction. The robust rules engine is highly customizable and provides compliance with meaningful used requirements as well as ACO, Jaco and PQRS reporting requirements.","These industry leading data driven services position LabCorp as a trusted partner to healthcare stakeholders, providing knowledge to optimize decision making, improve health outcomes and reduce treatment costs.","We continue to improve tools that assist physicians and patients in understanding test results and optimizing decision making. We\u2019re pleased with the recent HHS ruling which provides access to lab results for all patients.","Our patient portal, which has over 475,000 patient registrations and is growing daily is well positioned to support this need. And we can also deliver results directly to physician and health system portals where patients can conveniently review them.","Looking ahead, we will focus on providing additional content to our patient portal to further assist patients in understanding their lab testing results and needs.","We will assist our customers in analyzing their population health and clinical practice data with new tools for hospitals, physician practices and ACOs, supplemented with insights derived from our extensive patient database. We are working with clients to use our data to benchmark ordering patterns and to determine preclinical markers in specific diseases.","Insight gains from these efforts help payers and physicians better manage healthcare expenses and optimize patient outcomes.","The third pillar of our strategy is to continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. We are in the assessment stage of our comprehensive enterprise-wide cost structure review. It is too early for us to estimate the magnitude of opportunities to further streamline our operations and reduce costs. We will provide additional color on these initiatives on our second quarter earnings call in July.","The second installation of our propelled robot is live at our major laboratory in Tampa, and is now processing approximately one third of the facility\u2019s volume. We intend to begin the next installation of Propel in our Dublin Ohio facility early next year. Propel continues to drive expense reduction, increase throughput and accuracy and enhance specimen management at our Burlington lab.","We continue to consolidate facilities into our new Phoenix campus, and we\u2019re now processing more than 23,000 specimen\u2019s per day at this state of the art facility. As part of our cost structure assessment, we will evaluate our potential to consolidate additional facilities.","The fourth pillar of our strategy is to continue scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We introduced new tests and collaborate with leading companies and academic institutions to provide our physicians and patients with the most scientifically advanced testing in our industry.","We recently announced the availability of Thermo Scientific ImmunoCAP allergy testing products from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. Allergies effect approximately 60 million individuals in the United States annually and this population is growing. The results of a well documented relationship between allergies and asthma. LabCorp offers an extensive test menu to assist medical practitioners in determining whether patient\u2019s system support or rule out and allergy diagnosis, thereby suggesting other etiologies.","We continue to see strong growth across our suite of BRCA test for the assessment of breast cancer risk. Our BRCA testing menu includes a comprehensive panel of BRCA one and two, complete gene sequence analysis and deletion duplication testing, targeted analysis test for other family members once a mutation is identified and a panel for mutations prevalent among the Ashkenazi Jewish decent.","In combination with our care coordination pre-authorization service, LabCorp offers an end-to-end program that includes compliance with insurance requirements, comprehensive testing and expert interpretation from our license directors from our license directors and a team of 123 Board-certified genetic counselors and 9 medical geneticists.","In addition to our next-generation sequencing offerings for Familial cardiac diseases and the preclinical and clinical development of new HIB and HTB antiviral drugs, we recently announced the launching of our first multi-gene oncology panel primarily for solid tumors on the NGS platform.","Over the next several quarters, we will continue to expand our NGS offerings. To support this growth in the next-generation sequencing opportunities, we recently acquired the former Provance Genomics lab in Seattle, Washington. The capabilities of this leading next-generation sequencing laboratory include whole genome and whole exome sequencing RNA Seq, MIRNA Seq and other specialty NGS sequencing technologies.","The fifth pillar of our strategy is to develop knowledge services. We are now just a few months from marching Beacon LBS across United Healthcare\u2019s physician and patient base in Florida. LBS provides decision support tools to help guide lab and test selection, access to a lab of choice network and clinical and administrative rules engines for claim adjudication.","Beacon LBS assist physicians in managing lab ordering leading to better management of patient conditions and lower cost. We are excited about the valuable services that Beacon LBS offers physicians, patients and payers and will provide updates on this important initiative later this year.","Last month, we marched in Enlightened Health, which offers multiple capabilities to patients, physicians, health systems and pharmaceutical companies. Enlightened Health will include our patient facing capabilities, including ambulatory monitoring and the patient portal.","Physician and health system facing capabilities including clinical decision support, care intelligence and advanced analytics. Pharmaceutical capabilities including our clinical trial, central laboratory and data management businesses and several capabilities that touch, multiple stakeholders such as our genetic counselors.","Enlightened Health will continue to build capabilities organically and through acquisition to capitalize on our unique assets, diversify our revenue base and meaningfully differentiate LabCorp from the competition. We look forward to providing updates on these initiatives over the next several quarters.","We have positioned LabCorp to grow and excel through healthcare reform, an area in which quality, efficiency, scale and a central role in improving patient outcomes will be the key measures of success.","Now, Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.","Steve Anderson","Thank you, Dave. Can you elaborate on LabCorp\u2019s capital allocation policy?","As we have stated, we are committed to achieving a 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Based on our capital allocation history, we target half of our free cash flow for acquisitions and half for share repurchase.","We have a strong history of returning capital to our shareholders. Over the last decade, we have repurchased $5.6 billion of our stock, representing 78.1 million shares, at an average price of approximately $71.","Can you provide us with an update on your MoPath payment issues?","We are engaged with a number of States and pri-care to receive payments for these tests, most of which have long been covered are standard of care and are included in physician practice guidelines. We are making progress with some States but the process is slow and resolutions are still uncertain. The MoPath code changes, system problems and the complex procedures in some States have led to unconscionable delays in reimbursement.","As ACLA noticed, these coverage senile for standard of care test establishes a second class healthcare system for Medicaid and military beneficiaries. The refusal to pay laboratories for these pivotal tests is not sustainable, and patients will ultimately suffer.","In addition, we will continue to raise these non-payment issues with members of Congress that have key interests in the healthcare needs for and appropriate treatment of active duty personnel and their families.","We are finally starting to see recognition by some payers that they have to constructibly address this situation. We will update you on these important initiatives on future earnings calls until they are resolved.","How big of an opportunity is the recently-released Alberta RFP?","The size of this opportunity is approximately $200 million annually and the RFP is for a sole-source private provider. DynaLIFE is currently the sole-source private provider in Alberta and we are a minority partner in this business. The performance of this joint venture is captured on the equity method income line item on our P&L and is not consolidated in our revenue line.","Can you remind us of how drugs of abuse volume trended over recent quarters?","In the first quarter, our organic drugs of abuse volume increased approximately 10% year-over-year. This compares to a year-over-year organic increases of 15% in Q4 of 2013, 14% in Q3 of 2013, 10.6% in Q2 of 2013 and 10.2% in Q1 of 2013.","We also delivered strong year-over-year growth this quarter in our wellness and pain management businesses, which fall within our occupational testing services operations. We believe wellness and pain management testing will provide a great growth opportunity for LabCorp over the next several years.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dave.","David King","Thank you, Steve. And thank you very much for listening. We are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi Dave and Brad, can you comment on specific M&A in the quarter what you may have acquired and perhaps after the quarter what kinds of activity have you participated in?","Brad Hayes","Hi Bob, it\u2019s Brad. Nothing significant in the quarter to talk about in terms of this contribution specially and we take all of that out when discussing our organic volume growth number. And then on the future and what\u2019s in the pipeline I\u2019ll defer to Dave.","David King","Yes, good morning, Bob. Obviously, there have been some transactions we\u2019ve looked at number of things that we \u2013 for a variety of reasons including valuations have not been \u2013 have not felt good opportunities for us.","But the pipeline is quite robust, and we\u2019re looking at a number of opportunities that we think are both exciting for the long-term and have the potential to continue on the global trend that we\u2019ve established here.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Obviously, not a surprise Dave, this magnitude of share buyback wasn\u2019t bigger given where the stock was in the absence of many deals, why wouldn\u2019t that \u2013 you\u2019ve taken advantage of the stock price at the lower levels?","David King","Our philosophy is we try to be consistent in terms of share repurchase. And yes, the stock was at a lower point throughout much of the quarter. I will say however that also for much of the quarter there were \u2013 there was quite a bit of overhang from the potential for significant government reductions, the CMS administrative proposal to be able to cut the fee schedule, the looming SGR fix.","So, I think there was a lot of concern about what \u2013 how the share price is going to perform. And we don\u2019t try to be market timer, we try to take a very consistent approach to \u2013 we buy more when the price is down. And we did buy more this quarter given that the price is down. And we wouldn\u2019t have bought it if the price was higher.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just a last one Brad, can you just remind us what\u2019s in the guidance and what\u2019s excluded from the guidance, there is no incremental share repurchase or incremental acquisitions. But do you have the back analysis in there now in the oncology P&Ls in the guidance?","Brad Hayes","Yes. And you\u2019re right on share repurchase and it excludes anything after March 31 working.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Any other items out there that your store excluding?","Brad Hayes","Well, I think, some of our stance on some of the items that we said in the past is similar so MoPath for example, no assumption of any recovery there. Steve, went through a laundry list of things we went over but I can\u2019t think of a significant change from the last time we updated on any of those items.","David King","Correct.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Bonello, Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.","Bill Bonello \u2013 Craig-Hallum","Good morning, guys. Dave, I have a question, you spent a lot of time talking about Beacon Health and especially and Enlightened Health. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on how those programs actually generate revenue and maybe some sense of the magnitude of the opportunity with those programs to kind of profit margin that they have, just anything that lets us get our arms around what business is significant new driver of revenue and profit for you? And then I have a follow-up.","David King","Sure. So, the answer to the question is today they\u2019re not significant drivers of revenue and profit. Other than the clinical trial, central lab business will reside within Enlightened Health. And as we\u2019ve said, I think a number of times, that\u2019s approximately $150 million revenue business. And that business that as evidenced by our acquisition of the genomic slab in Seattle which were very, very pleased about that opportunity. We continue to grow.","The other aspects of Enlightened Health, I would describe them as internal startups. So there are businesses that we are starting to capitalize on for example, our genetic counselors. And the asset we have with genetic counseling, in ways in which those genetic counseling capabilities can be independent revenue generators, for example with interpretations of genetic testing results with interpretations of sequencing.","So, obviously, we\u2019ll continue to give you more color around this Bill, as these turn into revenue generating businesses. But I think this is a terrific opportunity for us from a strategy perspective, putting all the data analytics capabilities, all of the assets that we already have into a business that\u2019s focused on capitalizing them, facing the patient, facing the physician and health system and facing the pharmaceutical sponsors is a great long-term opportunity for us.","Bill Bonello \u2013 Craig-Hallum","And on the Beacon LBS side?","David King","Yes, I mean, I think Beacon LBS is again in the long-term is a terrific opportunity because as I think is fairly well recognized, lab is one of the last aspects of ancillary services in healthcare that basically has very, very limited management. And the management tool over there such as blanket preauthorization policies for all molecular testing that we\u2019re seeing from some players are the proverbial blunt instrument using the sledge hammer to address a much more targeted concern.","So, I think Beacon LBS would be a significant tool that will not only help a trend management but will also help with selecting the correct test for the patient at the correct time. I will say parenthetically with regard to Beacon LBS \u2013 there is no question that the margin in that business would be a lot different from the margin in our Corp testing business, because it\u2019s not a testing business.","It\u2019s more of an administrative decision support and management business. So, we need to think about that as we roll it out over time. But I think in terms of generating revenue and enhanced opportunities for the company, it\u2019s a terrific long-term opportunity.","Bill Bonello \u2013 Craig-Hallum","And at this point, are you prepared to give us anymore specifics about how you actually generate revenue, what is the source of that revenue is?","David King","Let us get it up and running and then we\u2019ll give you more detail around exactly how the revenue is generated. But we will be prepared to address that once we get to pile up and running.","Bill Bonello \u2013 Craig-Hallum","Okay. Thanks, thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Clair, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hi, I was hoping just to get some additional color on the MoPath reimbursement issues we\u2019ve seen. So, what was the impact in the quarter and when you say you\u2019re making progress, are you getting paid on the backlog in some of these States?","David King","David, its Dave. The impact on the quarter was not terribly significant, it was probably a little bigger than the impact on the quarter last year, just because in the first quarter of last year we didn\u2019t see a huge denial rate. When we say we\u2019re making progress, we\u2019re engaged with some of the key States where we have been experiencing difficulties. And of course we\u2019ve been heavily engaged with Tri-Care, which is one of the real pain points for us.","I think there is increased receptiveness from their perspective, there have been some commitments made about payments going forward and retrospective payments. But commitments made and dollars delivered are two different things and we haven\u2019t seen the dollars delivered. So, this is a high priority issue for us.","And again, unfortunately this is an issue where at some point, I think the industry and ACLA has been very much engaged in this. At some, the industry is going to have to make a decision about providing free services to these beneficiaries given that the payers are simply indicating that they\u2019ve decided not to pay for tested or standard of care that have always been covered. And that are critical to delivering appropriate and proper healthcare to the patient population.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you. And just a quick question on BRCA and your NIPT business, maybe you can give us an update on how these are performing compared to your original expectations?","David King","I would say BRCA is performing in terms of buying very well and probably better than our original expectations. NIPT, at this point is \u2013 has been in the mix for quite some time. And we\u2019re continuing to see \u2013 we\u2019re continuing to see strong growth there in terms of volumes. So, we\u2019re pleased with both of those businesses.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, my question really is about the guidance you absorbed a little over $0.20 of weather impact which wasn\u2019t in the original outlook. And you\u2019re adding a nickel back in. So, Dave, if you could just maybe sit back and help us think about what is in the outlook that\u2019s changed versus where we were. And if there is any things that you feel like need to be called out around what were in your original assumption to be helpful just to kind of square that over $0.25 differential?","David King","Darren, good morning, it\u2019s Dave. So, obviously there were a couple of positives during the quarter. The SGR fix was resolved in a way that did not have any near term impact. ICG-10 was postponed for a year so some expenses that we expected that we were going to have to absorb this year, we don\u2019t have to absorb. And then, obviously we had a pretty significant weather impact.","The positives, we have some expectation that BRCA is going to be positive from a volume enterprise perspective. We have not changed our assumptions on MoPath that is we assume it will be about the same.","We continue to exclude the impact of any significant M&A transaction that might occur. We continue to exclude the impact of share repurchase. And we haven\u2019t factored anything in for the cost reduction program.","There was, in the quarter, a gain on an investment that we made in a publicly traded company that benefited us. And so, all of those things and we still own some shares in that company. So, there is the potential for us to realize additional gain if we sell those shares during the balance of the year.","And obviously, the full year impact of the repurchase that we did in the quarter also is in whatever we\u2019re going to do, even if we didn\u2019t do any more share repurchase and I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not going to do any more share repurchase. But the full year impact of that share repurchase is something that we take account of. Although, again, we don\u2019t assume any further share repurchase in the numbers.","So, if you just look at our reported EPS which is $1.51, net of the $0.22 of weather. And you look at what the expectation was, which is $1.60, we\u2019re \u201c$0.09 under\u201d. What we\u2019re saying is that we feel given the strength of the business in the quarter and given what we see unfolding for the rest of the year that we will be able to make up that $0.09 differential. And add an additional $0.05 of earnings.","So, that\u2019s how we come up with the revised guidance which basically raised the top and bottom end by $0.05 and I hope that\u2019s a sufficiently thorough accounting of kind of how we get there. Again, the guidance is a range, it\u2019s not a point. The guidance is a range. And we\u2019re looking at the entire range of outcomes that might occur during the year and try and provide you with an accurate expectation of where we think we\u2019re going to come in.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. So, and just so my math is closed on the gain, it looks like it comes out to about $0.05 gain in the period. Is that about right?","David King","That\u2019s right.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then, just maybe just to follow-up and I\u2019ll jump off after this. But just to clarify, in your mind the biggest sort of swing factor now in the guidance, I mean, aside from M&A and buyback which we generally are used to seeing, but the biggest swing factor would just be some resolution and it\u2019s more like your pathology issue. Is that the right way to think about it?","David King","Well, I don\u2019t really think about it that way. I think the biggest factor in the \u2013 in where we come out in the guidance range is the underlying growth of the business and the price. So, we had a terrific, from a volume perspective, I think we had a very, very strong quarter.","The pricing, a combination of \u2013 we had the impact of sequestration, which we didn\u2019t have in the first quarter of last year, we had a little bit of MoPath, we have a small where we have a reduction in the physician fee schedule based on some code revaluation and the reduction in the clinical lab fee schedule which is part of the original ACA, we still have the 1.75% reduction.","We had some test mix issues with big growth and toxicology, which depressed this price. And we had the impact of the Canadian business, which both the government price cut increasing utilization and the exchange rate, all dragged on price.","So, certainly if we get paid for MoPath that will help us in terms of the guidance. But what will also help us is, continuing to grow the business and seeing some positive movement in the pricing.","Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Got it, okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor, Citi. Please proceed.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Hi, good morning guys. Not to be redundant, I just want to go back to the guidance for a second. I certainly understand all the mechanics and the pluses and minus. I guess, just broadly when you think about, you gave guidance. Weather was certainly much worse than the guidance had anticipated, you had a gain and some repurchase of couple of other things.","But still, generally the raise of guidance in the phase of that weather headwind, you just generally have to feel better about something? And I guess, it just sounds like there wasn\u2019t any explicit singular item but just in general when you look at the total range, you feel good about where you\u2019re at? Is that fair?","David King","I think that\u2019s fair. I think we\u2019ve answered the question in great detail in terms of what the components are. And obviously we wouldn\u2019t be raising guidance if we didn\u2019t feel that there was a reason why we would do better than the initial guidance that we put out.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Yes, I couldn\u2019t understand in that what isolated got better. But I know it was a very detailed answer. On the gain and the public company, could you share with us what that was or is that private?","David King","Yes, its foundation medicine and we were an original investor in the company. And when it went public, our shares obviously became public shares. And when the lock-up expired, we had the ability to sell them.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Okay, great. One more small question. I just want to make sure, on the 2.5% organic growth adjusted for weather and so forth, that\u2019s pretty close to our number. But, I think Brad had said that that excludes all tuck-in acquisitions and I apologize I know this has been asked in prior quarters. But I was under the impression that some of the small tuck-ins were kind of captured in that number, so I just want to make clear that 2.5% excludes any of even the small tuck-ins you do?","Brad Hayes","Well Gary, its Brad. And that\u2019s probably back to Bob\u2019s cash flow question. The small, small tuck-ins, we don\u2019t go through the exercise of excluding those. So those, what\u2019s excluded from that number are the \u2013 are larger type acquisitions where they have an impact on the \u2013 especially on the volume.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Great. And last question for Dave, just going back to the new lab pricing methodology that was in the doc fix legislation. I know the ACLA was in favor of that, a couple of the other lab lobbies with some opposition to kind of have a final rule came down. And it\u2019s very clear that the new price med would be developed would apply to any hospital billings and our clinical lab fee schedule.","But what is a little less clear is if the legislation explicitly mandates the hospital pricing information be captured in that. I just wondered, do you agree that latter part is less clear and kind of what\u2019s your view CMS develops the rights around that?","David King","No, I don\u2019t agree, it is less clear. I think it was explicitly stated in many discussions that we had with Congress and with congressional staff that market pricing has to include the entire market. So, market \u2013 what you want to do is make sure that Medicare laboratory testing is priced at market, then you can\u2019t look it through for examples as the flood OIG study did.","And say that that is market, market is market. And that includes large independent labs, it includes small independent labs, it includes hospital outreach labs. And so, I think the intent of Congress is very clear. I think obviously the devil would be in the details from the rule is propagated. But I think the rule should be very clear that the market has to include the determination of market pricing has to include all components of the laboratory services market, not selected or cherry picked components. And that certainly includes hospital outreach pricing.","Gary Taylor \u2013 Citi","Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman, Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Ryan Halsted \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning, this is Ryan Halsted on for Gary. I guess, I appreciate all the detail on the guidance. But I was hoping you could speak specifically to any change on your views on, impact from healthcare reform, especially considering the better than expected enrollment?","David King","It\u2019s Dave. I think our view on healthcare reform is that it\u2019s still basically not material to 2014 that is basically a net neutral. So we\u2019re not counting healthcare reform as a positive as we think about the guidance. We\u2019ll \u2013 obviously if our views change, we\u2019ll update that perspective but that\u2019s where we are today.","Ryan Halsted \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, thanks. And on your cost structure, I realized you\u2019re not prepared to provide any guidance on that. But just curious if any improved visibility on your reimbursement outlook, does that potentially change how you\u2019re thinking about your cost structure and timing on as you\u2019re reevaluating your cost structure?","David King","No.","Ryan Halsted \u2013 Wells Fargo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy, William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","Hi, thanks. I just had a quick question on M&A. So, I think you guys have been pretty consistent in terms of the types of assets that you pursued over the years. So, I\u2019m just curious going forward, should we expect you to pursue a similar strategy? And then also, have you seen a change at all in maybe the types of assets that are coming to market just given all the reimbursement pressure over the past few years here?","David King","Amanda, its Dave. I don\u2019t think you should expect us \u2013 you should expect to see us do anything dramatically different. Obviously with Enlightened Health, there are some aspects of those businesses as we start them up that there may be acquisitions that are \u2013 there are a little bit different from kind of core diagnostic testing. However, those would be small exploratory type transactions, they\u2019re not going to be anything significant in there.","In terms of assets coming to market, I think the mix is pretty much the same as what we\u2019ve historically seen, it\u2019s nothing \u2013 there is nothing in my mind that looks very different from what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. Again I think it\u2019s one of the right assets from a strategic perspective for us and what\u2019s the right valuation.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","Got it. And then, a question on Nex-Gen sequencing. So you\u2019re bringing up the number of test to market now. Just curious, what are your \u2013 do you have any insights and how payers may look at paying for those tests. And it doesn\u2019t seem like there is \u2013 well there isn\u2019t really an infrastructure in place for payment around those tests for the most part. So, any insights as to how that might evolve over time?","David King","No, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think your question has exactly the right premise, which there isn\u2019t really an infrastructure for payment that \u2013 of the testing using that methodology. And there isn\u2019t an established payment system, you can\u2019t just send somebody a bill and say we perform next generation sequencing.","So, currently, obviously we\u2019ll continue to build using the procedure codes that apply to the testing that we\u2019re doing. I think there are very robust discussions going on with some of the payer community right now about how they might think about paying for those tests in the future. And we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated on the developments there.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of AJ Rice, UBS. Please proceed.","AJ Rice \u2013 UBS","AJ Rice actually. But thanks, hello everybody. Two quick questions, first of all, just kind of on Hep-C testing, how big that is for you, if you\u2019re seeing any change because of the new drug capabilities here. And people want to get tested even more now. So, they have an option that could potentially cure them. Any thoughts on that?","David King","Yes, AJ, it\u2019s Dave. We\u2019ve highlighted Hep-C for the last \u2013 it is really since the CDC put out the screening guidelines as a growth opportunity. And we have seen nice growth there. I think the \u2013 and that\u2019s been probably for 12 to 18 months. I think these targeted drugs do give us additional opportunities both in our clinical trials business because of the expertise that we have at monogram which is probably the leader in development of Hepatitis-C testing.","As well as, as well as the cost of these drugs means that efficacy really needs to be demonstrated and we think that diagnostic test is an excellent way to show which patients are going to benefit from the drugs and which patients are probably not going to gain as much benefit.","So, we like Hepatitis-C is the long-term opportunity and we think we have the right assets in place to build that.","AJ Rice \u2013 UBS","Okay. And then, I was just going to ask a little bigger picture question. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve heard you guys comment in a while about the nature of the competitive landscape and whether you see it having changed much between the competition for hospital outreach labs, small labs and then competition among you and your biggest competitor.","I did notice, I think I saw pressure forth, maybe one of the exclusive contract with independent Blue Cross Blue Shield this quarter. I wonder wrapping that in to the comments about broader competitive landscape, is there any update offer there?","David King","Well, I think the industry remains extremely competitive. It remains highly fragmented. There are still many thousand clinical labs that are \u2013 that we compete with on a daily basis. So, I don\u2019t think that there is a lot that has changed. We have a lot of respect for our competitors, large and small. And we do some things better than some of them and they do some things better than we do.","So, we\u2019re always trying to improve our levels of service. We\u2019re always fanatical about our commitment to quality. It\u2019s a \u2013 but it\u2019s a tough industry. And obviously there is a lot of competition. And our job is to go out there and grow the business and excel in what we do. And I think our front-line people and our operational people have done a terrific job in doing that.","AJ Rice \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill, JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi Dave, I noted in your comments that you talked about managed care, pricing was flat sequentially. But can you give us an update of what it looks like year-over-year would be my first question. And then secondly, do you have any major managed care contracts that are up for you now this year?","David King","Lisa, its Dave. We don\u2019t have any major contracts that are up for renewal this year. And year-over-year the managed care pricing was down very slightly, not materially at all.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, great. And then, I guess, my second question would be, I know a lot of people were asking about acquisitions and I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about not having as much interest in some of these outsourcing deals with hospitals or outreach programs. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s changed at all, especially if we think forward and think of you as being a lower cost provider than some of these hospitals if you move towards ACA. Are they looking more enticing?","David King","Its Dave again. So, I think that all those things are being equal, we would prefer to do a more comprehensive deal with a hospital than with a health system than just buy an outreach program. I mean, we would like to work with them on their internal lab, we\u2019d like to work with them on rationalizing where the testing is performed and the utilization. We\u2019d like to work with them on population health management on delivering the tools that we deliver in terms of analytics and decision support.","So, that has been our preference in most of the hospital deals that we have done recently, we have focused on more comprehensive, a more comprehensive global approach. Part of the challenge in acquiring a hospital outreach program is because of the pricing that the hospital outreach labs typically command from the managed care payers.","When that pricing moves to RP schedule, there is significant revenue compression which also leads to significant profitability compression which makes it hard to pay the multiple but those outreach programs are looking for \u2013 because of how those businesses look when they move over to our pricing structure.","So, again that\u2019s why our focus Lisa, is more on the comprehensive partnership with the health systems than it is on individual hospital outreach lab acquisitions.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","\u2026.and clearly an area of focus for the business, at a high level, can you just walk us through your marketing and pricing strategy versus competition for these tests? I\u2019m just trying to frame how you\u2019re thinking about pricing scheme, either versus trends player in BRCA testing or a new developing market for example like Tumor profiling, where formal reimbursement hasn\u2019t been established yet?","David King","Isaac, I\u2019m sorry, but the first probably 15 seconds of your question got cut off, so maybe you could just recapitulate.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, probably it\u2019s actually Jo in for Isaac this morning. Just genetic testing, just trying to get an idea of your overall pricing and go to market strategy versus the competition. Just trying to frame how you\u2019re thinking about going in entrenched player for example in BRCA or new developing market like tumor profiling, where we just haven\u2019t seen for more reimbursement?","David King","Well, I think it\u2019s hard to comment in a lot of detail on those areas because obviously they are strategic and we assume there is competitors who listen to our calls. So, I think generally our go-to-market approach is that we try to come to market with a high quality reasonably priced comprehensive test offering with BRCA. We\u2019re especially proud of the capabilities that we\u2019ve been able to build around the database and around the preauthorization. So that we can help to make sure that patients are getting the services and that the services are going to be paid for.","I don\u2019t know that there is much more say then that is our consistent philosophy in terms of go-to-market, it fits exactly within the fourth pillar of our strategy. And we\u2019re going to continue to follow that.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. And then just a quick one on capital allocation. Any updates from the board regarding the dividend?","David King","Well, the decision about our allocated capital is management\u2019s decision. Obviously, we speak to our board about it quite a bit. And but it\u2019s management\u2019s decision. And our view continues to be at this point that acquisitions and share repurchase are appropriate deployments of capital and we\u2019re going to continue to deploy them that way.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks.","David King","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. I have two follow-up questions here. Firstly, on the volumes, I might have missed it. But when you talked about same-store volume growth of 2.5%. Can you just help us understand what was the contribution for that for drug of abuse, I know you talked about the year-over-year growth rate. But off that 2.5%, what was drug of abuse testing?","Brad Hayes","Ricky, its Brad. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get into that much detail. But we did have an acquisition that contributed but that was stripped out of the organic. And our regular drugs of abuse testing business, I think Steve, went over earlier was 10% growth in that business.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right, no, no, I understand that. But I\u2019m just trying to understand is it half of the 2.5%, is that very clear?","Brad Hayes","No, no, no. Small contributor but not close to half.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then, Dave, going back to the healthcare system question. You talked about more (inaudible) type of relationship with the hospital is kind of like \u2013 it\u2019s a preferred partnership.","What do you think is the episode of the healthcare systems given the fact that \u2013 over time we are moving or we will be moving toward episode of care type reimbursement and we\u2019re hearing kind of like the non-for-profit hospitals talking about that? So, are you being involved in these types of conversations because I think that\u2019s kind of like changes the whole kind of like approach towards reimbursement?","David King","Yes, Ricky, I know it\u2019s been you thesis that we\u2019re rapidly moving into a bundled payment world. And I would simply say that eve within payment bundles there are clear fee-for-service components. And the movement towards payment bundles is going to be incremental and evolutionary, it\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re not going to be in two years, and 100% bundled payment environment. It\u2019s just \u2013 it is not going to work that way.","So, certainly we\u2019re involved in many conversations with health systems with large physician practices about how they think the payment system is going to evolve and how the diagnostic testing is going to play into that. And we welcome those conversations because again, given the \u2013 given our cost \u2013 our cost position, I think we\u2019re in a great position to be a huge contributor of value there and to show integrated delivery networks and large health systems that we can really help them move the needle.","Not only on the cost of their lab services, but on the quality of the results they are delivering and on the analytics and the data and all of the things that we can do that will make them winners in the \u2013 in whatever the new models are.","So, one, I think bundled payments will go slowly and incrementally because there are lot of questions about how those payment systems are going to work and whether they are going to work and how providers are going to be rewarded. And two, yes, we\u2019re very much engaged in those conversations and look forward to the opportunity to demonstrate our value.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks, and good morning. Hi, Dave and Brad, I just want to follow-up on the revenue per acquisition. I mean, down another 3.3% this quarter, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really surprising. But if you look at the different components, I think decided Medicare test mix and the Canadian business. I\u2019m wondering if you could sort of break down those different factors and maybe give us a sense of what\u2019s really driving that revenue per requisition the most?","And ultimately I should think about that in a little bit longer term basis, I mean, obviously we have greater clarity on the Medicare side. But how do you think about the other factors driving revenue per requisition throughout the balance of the year and into next year?","Brad Hayes","Glen, its Brad. I\u2019ll start with the 3.3% that we reported. We talked about the impact there as being mix, our Canadian business in the government. We\u2019re not going to break that down any more specifically. But if you think back to the mix, the drugs of abuse testing businesses, having an impact there as well as an acquisition in that space.","Then also we have the Canadian business that we speak of, where the exchange rate is about 8% lower this Q1 than last Q1, so we\u2019ve had some erosion there. Plus, there is volume growth in that business which is essentially a capitative model so that drives down the price per. And then, the government reductions that we\u2019ve already talked about, the physician fee schedule, the clinical fee schedule and sequestration are all year-over-year impact to that number that we see.","Our goal is to have that number be more positive than 3.3% negative. And I think we look at that by focusing on the test mix in our business and trying to grow the higher value test that we\u2019ve spoken about several of those on this call. We certainly know with a little more clarity what\u2019s ahead in the government reimbursement world. But we realize that to be successful, we need to have solid and growing revenue per requisition as well as a volume of requisitions.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks to that comment. Maybe, if I could just follow-up Brad on the margin side. I think if I heard you correctly, you seem to suggest that margins were impacted by about 180 basis points due to weather, which would kind of imply an incremental margin of about 70% on that weather related lost revenues.","I\u2019m kind of curious, is that the right number and then as we think about the margins throughout the balance of the year within the context of your full year guidance, it kind of sounds like to get to that midpoint of the range, based on what you\u2019ve talked about in terms of revenues, we\u2019re assuming margins are down about 150 basis points, year-over-year. And how should we think about that ramp throughout the balance of the year?","Brad Hayes","Yes, you\u2019re right on the weather. It\u2019s probably a little higher drop down that you imputed. We take out the cost of our supplies and our bad debt to get there. So, yes, and if you think about our original guidance for the year, it would imply some margin compression as well.","So, I don\u2019t think of any besides not having a negative weather impact, I don\u2019t think of any ramping of the margin performance over the course of the year. We\u2019ll get better as we lack some things and we have growth, continued growth in our business. And then, some of the cost items and opportunities potentially start to contribute, that will help as well.","But nothing significant counted on and guidance work for that. So, I think you\u2019ve got it about right, generally speaking on the margins. And again, given our guidance for the year, that we initially gave, we expect those margins to be under pressure.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny, ISI Group. Please proceed.","Michael Cherny \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, good morning guys. So, just one last quick question from my end. When you think about the increase in the market, I know you talked about little bit of it over the course of the day. But seeing a big rise in the plus consumer direct health plans, how does that factor into the way you see your business performing and what impact has that had, at least both recently as well as in your expectations for next maybe few quarters or couple of years?","David King","Michael, its Dave. The plus consumer direct health plans is that with greater consumer responsibility and we\u2019ll create our pricing transparency. Our price point would be much more attractive. The minus is, it puts pressure on patient collections because we have to collect more and more dollars from the patient. And that\u2019s the reason that you saw the bad debt increase in the quarter.","Michael Cherny \u2013 ISI Group","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier, Maxim Group. Please proceed.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. You previously stated that the ICG-10 expenses this year would probably be in the $5 million to $10 million range. Are those expenses that you\u2019re now pushing off to 2015 or were some of them already spent this year?","David King","Bryan, its Dave. Some of them were already committed and some of them were able to defer.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","And given the longer timeframe, we\u2019d be able to better work that was caused into the regular workflow or should we not expect all of those, I guess, looks like you spent a couple of million, should we not expect all of those $5 million to $10 million to be additive to 2015 expenses?","David King","I think it\u2019s too early to tell with certainty. It gives us more time to work on some of the things that we\u2019d like to do in a more automated and less manual fashion. So we\u2019ll know about that as we get closer to the compliance.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","All right. And you discussed the possibility previously as some significant expense reductions that you\u2019re currently evaluating which were also excluded or continue to be excluded from guidance. Has that decision progressed at all?","David King","I think we\u2019ve answered the question three times that we\u2019ll value \u2013 we\u2019ll update it on the July call.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","All right. And just last quick one, you said that volume ex weather, would have been 5%. So, weather negatively impacted volume by about 2.4%. Can you remind us what the weather impact in the fourth quarter was?","Brad Hayes","Fourth quarter weather was actually on a year-over-year basis to the fourth quarter of the previous year a better comp, an easier comp. I don\u2019t remember the specific weather number in Q4.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo, Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird","Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to go back for a second to the fee schedule reprising. Aqua has been very supportive of the doc fix legislation, it seems like you guys concur. And one thing today have highlighted as the study that was performed by Avalere of the year that attempts to illustrate that average Medicare pricing is probably not too just similar from commercial pricing when you actually do include hospitals.","And they also seem to suggest that when CMS establishes these private payer rates in some instances, some of the non-hospital lab test rates could actually increase. And so, I just wanted to get your broad perspective on that study and whether or not you agree or disagree with their inclusions?","David King","With the Avalere study\u2019s conclusions?","Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird","Yes.","David King","Yes, it\u2019s Dave. Yes, I think the Avalere study was a very comprehensive look at a large number of data points and multiple MSAs, as big as New York City, as small as I think Boise Idaho. And what Avalere did was look at paid claims data, look at pricing data, look at a variety of sites of service, independent labs, small labs, nursing home labs that are \u2013 that were paid under the fee schedule, and hospital labs, commercial pricing, Medicare pricing.","And I think what the study demonstrated quite clearly is that Medicare is at or below market for almost all the test that we\u2019ve reviewed whether routine testing or a high complexity or low complexity testing. So, I think the Avalere study was a very detailed and comprehensive approach to determining what is market, and I think it \u2013 we bought it this notion that\u2019s been going on for a long time. And somehow Medicare is above market in the way that it pays for lab test.","Obviously, how CMS implements this rule is going to be significant and we at LabCorp, and I trust ACLA are going to be very significantly engaged in the rule-making process. But I do think that the way that the \u2013 there was a very strong policy view in Congress that they wanted Medicare pricing to be compared to and based off of market pricing.","There was a very strong policy view from the ACLA, from the LabCorp and the constituents that the market had to be a true market, not a manufactured market to make it look like Medicare was overpaying.","And the Avalere study shows that in the true market, Medicare\u2019s pricing is very, very competitive. So, I think that in the long-term this was a policy driven decision by Congress. And they can scrape that we have policy driven decisions as opposed to financially driven decisions. And we\u2019re going to be very much involved in making sure that policies are implemented in accordance with the way that Congress wanted them to be carried out.","Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird","Great, very helpful.","Operator","We have no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr. David King for closing remarks.","David King","Thank you all very much for listening this morning and good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference.

We delivered record revenue of $9.4 billion, record earnings per share of $8.83, and record free cash flow of $900 million, while driving margin improvement in both segments.

We continue to drive these strong financial results through a combination of operational improvements and long-term strategic initiatives. I will highlight key activities in these areas in turn.","In 2016, we made significant progress on a number of initiatives designed to enhance quality of care, improve our patient and customer experience, and increase efficiency. Through process reengineering, the integration of new tools and technology and facility consolidations, our LaunchPad program continues to deliver long-term quality and margin improvement to our Diagnostics segment.","The LaunchPad portfolio currently includes over 100 projects at various stages of implementation. At LaunchPad's inception, we established a goal of sustainably reducing $150 million of expense from the business during the three years ending in 2017. Ending in the year three, we remain on track to achieve this objective, and our LaunchPad initiatives will generate additional savings extending into 2018 and beyond.","Let me review a few of these activities now. Project Phoenix involves deployment of new Revenue Cycle Management technology. Our nationwide insurance eligibility verification tool has improved our ability to capture accurate patient information at the time of service in our patient service centers.","We also recently introduced, in several markets, a patient responsibility estimator which provides patients with an advanced estimate of what they will pay for our services. We plan to introduce this offering to our entire PSC network throughout 2017, improving pricing transparency and point-of-service collections, and reducing surprises for our patients when they receive their bills.","Project Horizon consists of multiple activities to improve the patient service center experience. As part of this project, we will provide new self-service registration options at select sites later this year, improve the PSC selection and appointment scheduling experience, and incorporate advancements in technology to allow patients to access these tools seamlessly from multiple mobile devices.","We also implemented a workflow and workforce optimization tool as part of Project Liftoff, enabling us to implement scheduled adjustments and process changes on a site-by-site basis for our contact centers and PSCs.","These improvements, along with new employee shift options, will provide greater certainty for our employees about their schedules, and enhance the customer and patient experience by deploying staff based on the real-time needs of our sites. Our initial pilot is underway, and we will deploy this technology in other functional areas in the future.","In addition to LaunchPad, we continue to benefit from the ongoing implementation of lab automation such as our proprietary Propel robot. The Propel robot enhances quality and efficiency, and reduces waste by replacing the manual pre-analytical splitting and sorting processes with automated precision. At the end of 2016, the Propel robot was operational at five sites including our recent implementation at Birmingham, and we plan to deploy additional systems in our major laboratories during 2017 and 2018.","In our drug development business, we completed the integration of our central lab facilities in Singapore and China, and are on track for mid-2017 site consolidations in the U.S. and Europe. These consolidations are an integral part of the $100 million of cost synergies in the Covance Drug Development business that we are on track to achieve during the three-year period ending in 2017.","Our commitment to continuous operating improvement drives a steady focus on quality, efficiency, and margin improvement. Concurrently to deliver long-term revenue and profit growth, we are pursuing several major strategic initiatives which I will now discuss.","We are focused on the complete organizational integration of Covance and LabCorp to build on our successes in the use of data, companion diagnostics, and specialized disease state expertise. Through the combination of LabCorp, patient data, and global Covance physician investigator data, we continue to win new orders and increase our win rate across multiple therapeutic categories.","In companion diagnostics, we worked on over 60 programs supporting over 145 clinical protocols in 2016, and we grew revenue 35% in this area since 2014. In the innovative area of immuno-oncology drug development, we doubled the number of study awards from 2015 to 2016, and also performed thousands of PD-L1 tests through our Diagnostic and Drug Development segments. We are the clear industry leader in these areas, and see great opportunity for growth in the years ahead.","As part of our ongoing data integration, we are focused on expanding our capabilities to support innovative applications. For example, we have amassed a growing database of approximately 100,000 patients who have provided consent through our patient portal to be contacted about future clinical trials.","We are also developing a cloud-based application that leverages public and proprietary data sources to help sponsors thoughtfully plan their clinical trial strategy. In addition, our data assets provide capabilities for conducting real-world evidence studies and providing hospitals, health systems, and large provider groups with greater access to clinical trials, an unmatched value proposition.","Another area of strategic emphasis is the implementation of our health system data and analytics platform in cultivating long-term comprehensive partnerships with anchor health systems. Last month, we entered into a significant transaction with Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. In addition to providing broad laboratory testing solutions and enhanced data analytics, we are incorporating Covance Drug Development's expertise into these relationships.","Over time, these anchor health systems will also become research hubs, improving their access to trials as well as Covance's site activation and investigator and patient recruitment capabilities. Our pipeline for these deals is stronger than ever, and we expect to continue to add health system partnerships this year and in the years ahead.","We likewise continue to invest in innovative solutions for our industry-leading portfolio of managed care partnerships. We bring several strategic differentiators to these important relationships, providing support for the healthcare systems transition to a value-based payment environment. BeaconLBS is a front-end platform that improves the quality of patient care, lowers patient and system costs, and provides guidance on lab and test selection.","The Litholink clinical decision support platform uses proprietary algorithms to tailor reports for chronic diseases including kidney stone, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, and cardiovascular, driving improved adherence to evidence-based guidelines and increased patient and provider engagement. These capabilities are only available through LabCorp, and we will continue to expand them as well as enhance them via machine learning, as we integrate more deeply into the delivery of care.","As these comments demonstrate, we are ramping up innovation in our combined organization, capitalizing on our unique capabilities. We are also focused on the expansion of our capabilities to alternate sites and methods of service delivery.","In Diagnostics, we continue to introduce and commercialize new tests and technologies, redesign our patient-facing applications, expand our food safety and integrity business, and advance our consumer engagement and price transparency initiatives.","In Drug Development, we continue to build on our accelerated informatics technology enabled platform, and leverage our unique market position as an end-to-end provider of drug development capabilities, from preclinical service all the way through to market access expertise.","We will also extend the availability of our services to new settings, enabling greater patient access and convenience. We continue to explore the opportunity to collocate patient service centers within retail pharmacies, where consumers are accustomed to seeking healthcare. In addition, we are working to integrate our lab testing solutions into telemedicine partnerships, reaching more patients and making it easier for them to access our services. Both of these markets represent new channels for long-term organic growth.","Finally, we are committed to returning capital to shareholders while making disciplined capital investments in our business and strategic acquisitions. As noted earlier, we resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter and plan to deploy our capital flexibly to continue to maximize long-term shareholder value.","In closing, we expect 2017 to be another year of significant innovation, as we continue to reposition ourselves to meet the needs of a rapidly changing healthcare system. We occupy a unique market position as a global life sciences company, presenting us opportunities to play an essential role in delivering high-quality and high-value patient care, unlocking long-term profitable growth, and increasing long-term shareholder value. Supported and inspired by the shared focus and commitment of more than 50,000 colleagues worldwide to improve health and improve lives, I have great enthusiasm for the years ahead.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments, and close with our 2017 guidance.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 6.3% over last year, due to the strong organic growth across both segments as well as acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 60 basis points.","Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 4.3%. Gross profit for the quarter was $788 million or 33% of revenue, compared to $741 million or 33% last year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the demand, price, mix, acquisition, and our LaunchPad and Covance cost synergy initiatives, partially offset by personnel costs.","SG&A for the quarter was $406 million or 17% of revenue, compared to $406 million or 18.1% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $5 million, primarily related to the integration of acquisitions and executive transition costs, compared to $32 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $401 million or 16.8% of revenue, compared to $374 million or 16.7% a year ago. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to acquisitions.","During the quarter, we reported $10 million of restructuring charges, primarily related to the ongoing consolidation of our drug development operations and associated severance. Operating income for the quarter was $323 million or 13.5% of revenue, compared to $237 million or 10.5% last year.","Excluding amortization, restructuring charges, and special items of $64 million, adjusted operating income was $388 million or 16.2% of revenue, compared to $367 million or 16.4% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to price, mix, acquisitions, and our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives.","The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to the mix impact from the acquisition of Sequenom. Excluding Sequenom, margins would have increased 10 basis points over last year.","Interest expense for the quarter was $53 million, down from $57 million a year ago, due to lower debt balances. The tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%, compared to 38.5% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate was 33%, down from 33.9% last year, primarily due to lower foreign tax rates.","For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was approximately 34%, in line with our prior expectations. We expect the rate in 2017 to also be approximately 34%, which assumes no major regulatory changes to the U.S. corporate tax code.","Net earnings for the quarter were $184 million or $1.75 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring charges, and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.15 in the quarter, up 9% over last year.","Operating cash flow was $449 million in the quarter, an increase of $64 million over last year, primarily due to higher earnings and improved cash collections. Capital expenditures totaled $74 million or 3.1% of revenue, down from $85 million or 3.8% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $375 million in the quarter, an improvement from $300 million last year.","At quarter-end, our cash balance was $434 million, down from $568 million at the end of the third quarter. Total debt was approximately $5.8 billion. During the quarter, we invested $152 million in acquisitions, paid down $302 million of debt, and reinitiated our share buyback program repurchasing $50 million of stock. As a result, we have $740 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program at year-end. The company's leverage at year-end was 3.1 times gross debt to last 12 months' EBITDA down from 3.3 times at the end of the third quarter.","Now, I'll review our segment performance beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 7.8% over last year. The increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions, price, mix, and organic volume measured by requisitions. Revenue for requisition increased 5.2%, benefiting from price, mix, and the Sequenom acquisition.","In addition, esoteric testing grew at faster rate than core testing. Total volume increased 2.7%, of which organic volume was 0.6% and acquisition volume was 2.1%. LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $318 million or 19% of revenue, compared to $292 million or 18.8% last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to price, mix, acquisition, and our LaunchPad initiative.","Operating margins were up 20 basis points, despite the negative impact of 50 basis points from the Sequenom acquisition, which we continue to expect to be accretive to earnings during our first year of ownership.","Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $716 million, an increase of 3.5% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 160 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement which annualized at the end of October, revenue increased 6.1% over last year. The revenue growth was primarily due to increased demand in our clinical and early development businesses as well as favorable mix in central labs.","Adjusted operating income was $106 million, or 14.9% of revenue compared to $110 million or 16% last year. The decline in operating income and margin from last year's record performance were primarily due to investments in the sales force and CRAs to support ongoing growth, partially offset by favorable demand mix and cost synergies.","On a sequential basis, margins increased 130 basis points over the third quarter, primarily due to improved clinical efficiencies. Beginning this quarter, we are reporting net orders and backlog on a fully executed contract basis as opposed to the industry practice of recognizing orders and backlog based on non-contracted written awards. We're also providing our expectation of the contracted backlog that will convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","Beginning next quarter we will report net orders and book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis only. We adopted this approach as we believe this methodology creates a more conservative threshold for including awards in the backlog and with our new disclosure will provide greater visibility into revenue conversion from the backlog.","Using this methodology, net orders and net book-to-bill during the quarter were $849 million and 1.19 respectively, compared to $887 million and 1.24 under the prior methodology. These strong results were negatively impacted by the cancellation of two large clinical studies late in the year for which we provided central laboratory services.","During the trailing 12 months using this methodology, net orders and net book-to-bill were $3.1 billion and 1.11, respectively, compared to $3.3 billion and 1.16 under the prior methodology. Backlog at the end of the year was $4.9 billion, and we expect approximately $2 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","This change in methodology resulted in the removal of $2.2 billion of non-contracted written awards from the backlog, a substantial portion of which will be contracted and added to the backlog in 2017.","Now, I'll provide our 2017 guidance, which uses foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2016, and includes the impact of anticipated capital allocation including acquisitions, share repurchases, and debt repayment.","We expect reported revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, after adjusting for the negative impact from approximately 60 basis points of foreign currency translation. We expect LabCorp Diagnostics reported revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, after adjusting for the negative impact from approximately 10 basis points of foreign currency translation.","We expect Covance Drug Development reported revenue growth of 3.5% to 5.5%, after adjusting for the negative impact from approximately 180 basis points of foreign currency translation.","Covance's revenue growth in 2017 is lessened by approximately 100 basis points due to the cancellation of two large clinical studies late in 2016 for which we provided central laboratory services.","Our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance is $9.35 to $9.75, an increase of 6% to 10% over 2016 including the negative impact of foreign currency translation. We expect free cash flow to be between $925 million and $975 million, up from $897 million in 2016 and expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 3% of net revenue, consistent with 2016.","From a timing perspective, all of our guidance is expected to be impacted by seasonality, one fewer day this year as the result of leap year in 2016 and other factors referenced in our comments. As a result we expect first half results to be lower than second half results.","In summary, we're enthusiastic about our prospects for 2017. We expect strong top line growth and margin improvement to translate into attractive earnings per share growth. In addition, we expect to deploy our strong free cash flow to strategic acquisitions, returning capital to shareholders and debt reduction, which will continue to build long-term shareholder value.","This concludes our formal remarks and we'll now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Jack.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, I want to start \u2013 Dave, you talked about the pipeline on the hospital side, really good to see the Mount Sinai deal this quarter. I'm curious, as you look at the funnel, what do you think is driving the conversation and do you think a reimbursement is part of the equation with some of the changes coming in 2018?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So, I think that part of the conversation is in anticipation of the potential impact of PAMA. I think part of the conversation is some uncertainty around generally regulatory reform, how much of the bundled payment demonstrations and other things that CMS has been doing, are going to continue and what form they'll take.","And, yes, to your specific question, I think as we talk with our managed care partners, there is more and more of a push toward what they broadly characterize as value-based payment. And value-based payment includes bundled payments. It includes pay for outcomes. It includes pay for adherence to metrics. And I think a lot of hospitals and health systems are focused on what are our core competencies in delivering value-based care and where can we partner to gain those competencies elsewhere.","And I think in Diagnostics, laboratory services and drug development obviously are our competencies or our \u2013 and capabilities are industry-leading. So, I think it's a combination of things, but I do think the environment obviously is changing and that's to our benefit and a lot of it is the long-term play that we've been doing about how these partnerships take shape and what the value is over the long term.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes sense. And then just as a follow-up for Glenn, you mentioned that the guidance assumes some level of capital deployment from here. Can you just be a little bit more explicit in terms of share repurchase what the expectation is or what the share count you're using for guidance is? Thank you.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Hey, Jack. It's the overall \u2013 what we're saying is that the free cash flow which obviously we guide to, we're going to fully redeploy in 2017. And that is reflected in the guidance range that we have. It will be inclusive of share repurchases, which again we reinitiated in December of last year.","It will include M&A, obviously the announced deal that we've already had, but also a pretty good pipeline as well as debt repayment. At this point, we're not commenting specifically on how much of that free cash flow will apply to each, other that we expect it within that range to encompass all three.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Glenn, did you mention \u2013 I know Sequenom was a drag on earnings in the third quarter. What was the experience in the fourth quarter? Are we at profitability there yet?","And then maybe for Dave to the acquisition question, the stock seems to be trading more on speculation over what you may acquire than maybe on the fundamentals here. Can you review maybe what your parameters are, highlighting areas of opportunity and interest for you and what doesn't fit, and any thoughts on transaction sizes that would be palatable to LabCorp?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Okay. I'll start with the first part, Bob, on Sequenom, which is as we commented even, I believe in last quarter, we expected the fourth quarter for Sequenom to be a loss of operating income during the quarter, so a little bit dilutive. We expect it to be accretive to earnings in our first year of ownership.","And so as we go into 2017, we expect obviously profitability for Sequenom. But for the fourth quarter, it was a constraint. And I think we spoke to the fact that even with Diagnostics showing there's margin improvement, it was actually constrained by the loss of Sequenom in the quarter but will be favorable to earnings next year.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Bob, good morning. On the acquisitions, so, obviously, let me start by saying, not going to speak about any rumors for specific deals, but I think it's a good question, how do we look at acquisitions broadly. So, first of all, there's a very healthy pipeline in both segments, and I think it's important to emphasize for analysts and investors that we try to look at everything that may be relevant to us. So I think people would be surprised, the number of transactions that we look at that we end up not being interested in, and I think that's important to say because obviously there has been a rumor out that we're looking at something, and it was in the newspaper and people should recognize that we look at a lot of things, and we end up passing on most of them because they don't fit.","So, what's the question about how things fit? Let me start with the framework and go back to the presentation that we made at JPMorgan in which we highlighted that one of our pre-2017 priorities was to reinitiate return of capital to shareholders. And as Glenn said, we started that in 4Q of 2016 and our plan is to continue that. Our philosophy around M&A is that there are sort of four fundamentals: One, it has to be a strategic fit. That may be geographic, that may be complementing test menu or capabilities, but the transaction has to fit our well articulated long-term strategy.","Second, it has to meet financial metrics, so IRR, return on invested capital, multiples, synergy opportunities, these are things that are a very important part of how we think about acquisitions.","Third, it has to create or present a future growth opportunity. So, as we've highlighted with Sequenom, even though it didn't meet all of our metrics out of the gate, the future growth opportunity in women's health and non-invasive prenatal testing where we're now the market leader, and the opportunity to add capabilities to Sequenom's platform was a very important consideration. So we think about how is that acquisition potentially going to help us grow in the long term.","And then fourth, of course, is EPS accretion. We fundamentally want these deals to be immediately accretive but we certainly think about them being accretive over time as an important consideration.","And then the last thing I would comment just broadly is, as a general composition, before Covance, our approach was after CapEx and investment in the business, we spend about half our free cash flow on acquisitions and we spend about half of it on returning capital to shareholders and you should continue to think about that as our fundamental philosophy of how we deploy cash in the business.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning, guys. I'm just going to beat on that same question in a couple of different ways, if I can. If I just do some sort of back-of-the envelope math in my head and I think of you deploying almost $1 billion of free cash flow to either acquisitions or share repurchase, it feels like the guidance you gave is kind of low. And so what I'm trying to figure out is, within the scope of what you're contemplating, do you allow yourself room for, hey, there may be acquisitions that could be potentially nicely accretive but because of the timing on when they get completed in 2017 or the time in which you realize some of the synergies, they don't necessarily \u2013 aren't as much of a boost to 2017 as they might be to the future? I'm just trying to figure out why maybe the math doesn't work so well.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Bill, it's Dave. As you know, the guidance incorporates a wide range of potential outcomes. And you should think about timing as being a very important factor because transactions that may be in the pipeline, that may be rumored to be in the pipeline, that may be rumored to be coming to market, timing of signing, closing, antitrust clearance \u2013 all those affect where the earnings power is created and how accretive the transactions are.","So, I think it is important as, as you know, we don't slice and dice the guidance to try to break down every individual number and what's contemplated there. But there is a fair balance in the guidance of capital deployment towards share repurchase and capital deployment toward acquisitions.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Bill, too, just to kind of level-set, what our guidance does reflect is obviously good top line growth across both of our businesses, margin improvement, and then with capital allocation even driving earnings even higher.","And then just to reinforce Dave's point, we do have a lot of timing and how much we allocate of that free cash flow between the various areas that we can. But we view the overall guidance that we're providing would be another very strong year for the company.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Sure.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Just one other comment I should make which is, the guidance includes a pretty strong headwind from currency that does knock down where we would end up, all other things being equal. So I think it's important to recognize that we need to factor in, there is an impact on revenue from currency translation and as we've often said, that when you take that drop-down off of that revenue to earnings, that has an impact on obviously what we earn.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Sure. Okay. That makes sense. And then if I can, my follow-up, just curious how you think about leverage. Obviously you were willing to take on a significant amount of debt to do Covance. If you were to do a big CRO acquisition, I'm not looking for you to comment on that, but presumably that would require a significant amount of debt too. What I'm curious is, how you think about leverage \u2013 in the absence of those opportunities, potentially taking on any leverage for share repurchase just given that you're at an unprecedented discount to your peers right now.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So I'll start and then Glenn may have some additional comments. We established I think back in 2009 or so that our target leverage is 2.5 times. Obviously in the seven or eight years since, the company has grown pretty substantially in terms of the amount of EBITDA that we generate. So, that 2.5 times remains a target. It is not a commandment, and we've demonstrated a willingness to be flexible about our leverage. For example, we repurchased shares in the fourth quarter even though we're not at 2.5 times leverage because we thought it was a great opportunity to deploy capital and return it to shareholders.","In terms of increasing the leverage, we've demonstrated a willingness to do it for M&A. Our investment grade rating is important to us, and that's something that we would intend to maintain. Increasing leverage for share repurchase, again, it depends on what else is out there in the marketplace. We know the value of investing in our own business. We know the return from buying our own shares, and we evaluate that against what's the value of other things we might buy, what's the long-term return on other things that we might buy. And we'll be disciplined about how we deploy and use the leverage in 2017 and obviously in the years ahead.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. The other thing I'd add to that, Bill, is that the company is generating significant and sustainable free cash flow and as a result it gives us the flexibility to utilize the balance sheet appropriately as we feel we need to do, but we've gotten the leverage down from when we've done it. We ended the quarter at the end of the year at 3.1 times and again we've got another strong year of cash flow ahead of us.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Two questions from me. One, organic volume in the lab seemed to bounce back nicely relative to 3Q, even though there probably was some Hurricane Matthew dynamic to consider. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on kind of market share growth within the lab segment.","And then secondarily on the CRO, as you look at the margin performance, it did bounce back sequentially. But you were down year-over-year on operating profit. I just wanted to know, within the guidance that you set forth for 2017, when do we start to think about the CRO growing again from a profitability perspective? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So, on the organic volume in Diagnostics. Nick, I think this and the second part of your question just demonstrates that it can be a little bit deceptive to look at a particular quarter over a particular quarter in a prior year. And so I think if we look broadly at 2016, we saw about 1% organic volume growth. That's about what we think the market is growing.","We had a dip in the third quarter which I think was anomalous for a variety of reasons. We had a strong recovery in the fourth quarter. And as you say, that was dragged a little bit by Hurricane Matthew. But we felt very good about fourth quarter volume growth, particularly because it's growing in esoteric, it's growing in women's health, it's growing in the focus areas that we're devoting our resources to.","So, nice strong volume growth in the fourth quarter. We look to 2017 and say approximately 1% organic volume growth seems to be market, we obviously want to beat that, but that's how we think about the year.","And I'll turn it over to Glenn and John in terms of the Diagnostics margins \u2013 I'm sorry, the Covance margins.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I'll take a first cut and John, you may want to provide more color. But as you commented, Nick, we feel good about the sequential improvement that we had in the business. When we think about the comp in the fourth quarter, we obviously are comparing it to a record quarter, I think 16% margins in the fourth quarter a year ago. As we look to 2017, we believe \u2013 again, we're giving you the revenue guidance but we also believe we're going to get margin expansion, benefiting from the growth of the business and continue to improve on the clinical efficiencies. We also did comment though that the first half for the company will be lighter than the second half for the company and that affects Covance as well.","Obviously we continue to invest in the business. We talked about the labor, the call it sales force, the CRAs that haven't annualized yet. So that will be a headwind in the first part. We also talked about the late cancellations that obviously will have an impact in the first half as we look to replenish given that those were active accounts that we had. So, again, we expect good margin improvement year over year, but expect that the first half would still be light year-over-year in the first half of 2017 and then picking up very nicely in the second half.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. I'll hop back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning. Dave, usually this conference call is the opportunity to highlight some of the things that came out of our conference on the Covance side. What were people looking for this year? And I know John is on the call, anything that you want to highlight that you were able to sign as we think about 2017?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, we don't talk about things that we've signed until they become public. From my perspective \u2013 I mean, from my perspective, what came out of the conference room from the Covance perspective was a better understanding of how well the integration between the two businesses has gone. We talked about the patient recruitment and site selection, we talked about the companion and complementary diagnostics already. Again, I want to highlight our work on Keytruda, our work on Opdivo, our work on Tagrisso and Tarceva, our work on Tacendra (42:58). I can't even pronounce the names of these drugs, but really, just a terrific performance in terms of establishing industry leadership in the development and the commercialization of companion diagnostics in a way that we don't see any competitor present.","We highlighted our ability to partner using LabCorp and Covance with real-world evidence and post-market surveillance capabilities, specifically around the liver testing example of top 20 pharma where we're using the LabCorp resources to do the draws, we're using the Covance market access to remind patients of their appointments and scheduling, and we're using the combination of our technology to deliver results to physicians and patients.","We highlighted how we can specifically open and close sites based on real-time data that LabCorp is receiving on things like respiratory tract infections. We highlighted the database that physicians who order the FibroSure test in recruiting NASH trials, the scientific capabilities that our combined organizations bring to sponsors, and obviously the value of our oncology, rare and orphan and infectious disease capabilities and the opportunity around the research hubs and the whole research hub model that goes back into the health system partnership.","So, those are probably the kind of the big \u2013 I hope that we conveyed to investors a better understanding of what are the ways in which the organizations are really working well together and how do we think about the long-term opportunity and why we think the long-term trajectory for these businesses combined is really terrific.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And I think you saw that in the strong book-to-bill within the fourth quarter, the strength across the businesses, whether that was in clinical or in the labs or in early development. And you saw the solutions that Dave just talked about coming to the fore.","And even though we had the cancellations in the two large lab studies, still pulling off 1.24 and without that being in the high 1.3s. So, nice performance, and that's kind of how you gauge whether the integration is moving swiftly and you're seeing that within our ordering.","Lisa Christine Gill - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Right. I wasn't talking about from an investor perspective. If I did remember our Q&A from maybe the last two years, it was more around the opportunities of meeting with pharma and biotech and what they were looking for from Covance and some of the incremental opportunities without naming specific opportunities. So, I was just looking for any incremental color from that perspective.","Did you feel like it was better than the last two years, in line with the last two years? Just any color around how you think about how that went versus your expectation or what you've seen in previous years. And I know, John, this was your first time from a Covance perspective.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. I saw a great amount of partnering activity, the biotech business area and the large pharma mid-tiers, significant partnerships that either were initiated or developed and great momentum across the marketplace. Obviously we have R&D growth, but at the same time I think the partnering capabilities with the data that we are driving from the LabCorp side and\/or solutions that we're driving with respect to the combination our customers are seeing, and that was evidenced by all the different partnering capabilities that we saw at the conference.","Lisa Christine Gill - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. This is Elizabeth in for Ross. I just wanted to ask a question regarding the change in management at Covance. I wanted to just hear sort of a little bit more about how has the team reacted, what incremental opportunities do you see available? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I'll start. It's Dave, Elizabeth. My perception is that John is a terrific executive, he has been well received both internally at LabCorp and Covance and externally by our sponsors and partners, and as I think he just highlighted, the opportunities in terms of partnering in terms of the level of interest in the LabCorp and Covance services is very high. So, we feel terrific about the leadership change and about where it's going to take us in 2017 and ahead.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think that we've seen great double-digit growth in studies based on the data side and this is all about net orders at the end of the day and winning, and so we're seeing that show up in the marketplace for us.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just had a follow-up with some of the conversations on the CRO side. I was just wondering, so obviously you have....","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Hey, Amanda, can you \u2013 Amanda, can you speak up a little bit. You're really muffled.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Is this better? I'm sorry.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","I just had a quick follow-up to some of the questions on the CRO side. So, obviously you had a good, strong book-to-bill, but I was curious if you could talk to some of the broader trends. I think a couple of others have seen cancellations and I think some have mentioned dynamics around revenue conversion just given shift to biologics over time, I'm wondering if you could speak those two dynamics more broadly.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Okay. I think in terms of the book-to-bill, was strong across each area. We are different in the sense that on the revenue conversion side we are the only broad early development lab and in clinical business CRO. And so in early development you do have faster backlog conversion. At most, you will have two to four quarters of that booking convert into revenues with a little bit faster within the early development timeframe.","In terms of cancellations just in the fourth quarter was probably our highest within the last couple of years, if you look at that quarterly rate. And thus the 1.24 at the end of the day or the 1.19 new methodology is showing real signs of strength in the quarter itself. So that's a little bit of color on \u2013 A, the book-to-bill, and the cancellations.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","So I guess is there \u2013 so there's nothing to read into the cancellations in terms of that becoming a broader trend? Obviously, there's concern around that.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No. This was well publicized, cancellations late in the quarter, November, and it's clinical research. And there's nothing to do with an industry trend.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","And then just totally switching topics, I had a question on Beacon, just wondering what you're seeing...","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Amanda, I'm really sorry but we just cannot make out what you're saying.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. So, I'll try \u2013 I'll get back in the queue. I'm sorry. Something is wrong with my phone clearly. Thank you, though.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Alex Nowak on for Bill today. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned that there are numerous benefits to the business of having patient health data after combining the Diagnostics and CRO business. So I was just curious, are there any other verticals that you would consider acquiring or partnering with to gather additional patient health data?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It's Dave. Good morning. I would say we're always partnering with other organizations to enhance our database and broaden our reach in the patient population, and generally we don't talk broadly about the specifics, but you can feel confident that we are always reaching out to find other sources of data that will expand our resources just beyond pure lab data.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then I think my second question is what Amanda was going to ask, but we're hearing the BeaconLBS project in Texas is getting some pushback and may actually potentially be on hold. So I was just curious what is the latest there?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. So, as you probably know, United has delayed the claim denial application part of BeaconLBS and a postcard went out to physicians, and I'll just comment briefly on that. So, first of all, as you may remember, we had a similar situation in Florida, and so this is sort of part of the normal course of how you change healthcare and change patient and provider behavior, there's a lot of learning, there's a lot of detail, and we're always trying to accommodate the balance between what needs to be done and what the marketplace needs to get what needs to be done, done.","The decision support tool is active and UnitedHealthcare has encouraged physicians to use it to become accustomed with it so that at the point where they do implement, the market will be ready. We have 98% of Texas physicians registered and 89% of the Texas labs within the network are registered, and we continue to enhance the platform with things like EMR integration and new tools and capabilities.","I do want to comment editorially that the need for this type of tool is great, and as you probably have seen, it was probably reported that UnitedHealthcare sued a toxicology lab in Texas that was charging 3 to 10 times the amount of network providers and 2 to 3 times the amount that out-of-network providers charge, which meant that it was charging the customer between $1,400 and $6,500 for toxicology panels that were available from network providers for vastly lower amounts.","This generates unnecessary cost for the system and it generates unnecessary out-of-pocket cost for patients who are paying co-payments and deductibles. And to the extent that that's addressed by providers by waiving patient co-pays and deductibles, that's a non-compliant practice that just drives additional systemic costs.","So, the BeaconLBS tool is constantly iterating and improving to make it better and that's part of the reason why the implementation in United, again, the \"hard implementation\" has been delayed, although the tool is available and being used. But this is absolutely necessary if we want to change the cost of the healthcare curve and eliminate non-compliant practices in the marketplace.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. There are local press reports of you buying PAML, which is a fairly sizeable regional lab. I guess I'm just wondering, is that a unique opportunity or are you seeing more larger regional assets coming up and can you give us a sense of all the range of revenue and EBITDA multiples for just deals generally and maybe the margin profile of outreach businesses when you buy them?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I'm not going to comment on anything about any particular transaction. And I think to some extent we've responded to this question earlier, which is the pipeline is robust and there is new interest from health systems generally and more broadly. In terms of strategic opportunities, that may include sale or it may include broader partnerships.","In terms of multiples, I mean, it's just \u2013 there's no way to characterize what multiples are going to be of revenue and EBITDA. Every system is different. Even the way that health systems account for their lab revenue is extremely different. Some, for example, charge the lab with IT. Some don't charge the lab with IT. That makes the supposed profitability look very different.","So, suffice it to say, I go back to what I said before, which is we're disciplined about our financial metrics. We're disciplined about the way we deploy our capital. We're looking for acquisitions that are strategic, provide growth opportunities, meet our return criteria, and are going to be accretive.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then, just a follow-up, Dave, you talked about the push toward value-based. If payers are focused there, do you think there's an incentive or a continued incentive for exclusive relationships to continue versus payers wanting sort of broader access to lower costs in national labs versus narrowing the network to just one?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I can't really comment on payer philosophy. I would say, I think we have a terrific managed care book and highly valued managed care partnerships, and we're going to continue to pursue solutions that not only meet their needs, but meet the needs of the healthcare system and of patients and providers.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Dave and Glenn. So, I guess without discussing any specific M&A opportunities, just at a high level, some investors have asked us, in general, whether short-term stock reactions to things that you may or may not acquire, whether that reaction is positive or negative, is this something that you pay attention to when pondering M&A? Or is this maybe just \u2013 let's say, less critical in your thinking, and instead, you and everyone at LabCorp just stays focused on what they think is right for the business? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I have emphasized over the years and continue to emphasize that we always look at long-term value creation. We always look at what is right for LabCorp as a business, and we believe that in the long term that will serve the best interest of our shareholders. That said, our shareholders also have some input into what they think is going to create long-term value. We listen to them very carefully on things like return of capital, and you can see that we've responded to that.","Again, even though our leverage was not a target in the fourth quarter, because this was highlighted as something that's very important, and so we spend a lot of time with shareholders, we listen closely to their input. We value their views highly, and we take that into consideration.","Stock price reaction, that's less of a factor because there are so many moving pieces in how the stock reacts. So, again, long-term interests of the business, long-term value creation, views of investors, those are things that are very important to us as we think about the strategy for the business ahead.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. One other real quick one, this seems pretty straightforward, but just any additional color around the thought pattern on the change in the book-to-bill methodology or just the timing of doing it now? Thanks.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, Steve, this is Glenn. As we reflected on it, we saw, obviously, another CRO that's changed their methodology as well. It is interesting that the backlog has been built up, if you will, based upon just \u2013 it could be an e-mail just stating that here's future business that we'd like you to work on.","I think, from our perspective, being more conservative, just to know that we have an executed contract that we would now be working on and calling that the backlog we felt was a better representation of the backlog, again, better visibility of saying out of that backlog now that we have, how much will that translate into our revenues over the next year. And then, obviously, giving guidance for revenue, it also gives you a good sense of what business do we need to bring into the company during the year and still transact during that year. So, we think it's just overall more conservative, better color on the business. And yeah, we again, saw someone else do it, and we agree with that methodology.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's great. Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We're past 10 o'clock now and we still have a number of people in the queue, so we'd like to finish up no later than 10:15. I'd encourage people to be concise. And unless you really need a follow-up, let's try to limit it to one question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just a quick follow-up on that last question. So, does the change in order and backlog reporting, does that impact the business operationally in any way when it comes to sales compensation or any other metrics, or is it purely optics?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It does put a renewed focus on the time between the award and the contract and what efficiencies you can drive for that. But as to the overall operational approach, no, it does not change.","And I'd also say, if you \u2013 coming from outside the industry to inside the industry and now being an old-time vet, if you ask coming in, what do you generate backlog on, and it's not a contractual obligation, it just hits you that it might be a more conservative approach to go to the contract. It's just a more rational approach to go to the contract side and eliminate some level of volatility at the same time between that award and contract. But bottom line, it doesn't change the operations.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. Just I wanted to ask \u2013 I think in Glenn's prepared remarks, he talks about the Phoenix initiative and also the discussion about collocation of sites with retail pharmacies. First, on the Phoenix one, when you think about what you're doing with Revenue Cycle Management upfront being able to tell patients, I guess, what their co-pays and so forth might be, can you give us any sense of what you think that might mean for you over the next year or two in terms of potential savings relative to bad debts or bills that you can't submit because they're not properly filled out?","And then, on the collocation on the pharmacies, what does that opportunity look like long term? Is that just broadening your reach, or is there some actual cost savings from potentially rationalizing phlebotomists, and things like that? Give us some flavor on those two a little more.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","A.J., it's Dave, and those were in my remarks. I feel obligated to respond to...","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, sorry about that.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","On Phoenix, I mean, there's two or three benefits from Phoenix. So, the first one is the patient knows at the time of service what their actual responsibility is going to be, and that's helpful because if it's more than they want to pay, they have the option to say, I don't want to pay, or I don't want the test, or I don't want a particular test. And those are things that are going to be incorporated into the patient service center experience, and ultimately we want to push that out to physician offices as well through our lab connect tool.","The benefit for us is, we collect credit cards from patients at the patient service center. We don't know how much the patient is going to owe or we haven't historically. And so, often we collect a credit card where the patient doesn't owe anything, and we don't collect a credit card where the patient does owe. And we ask the patient for more money authorized to the credit card than they are going to owe us, and so we get some resistance. This way, it's going to be an exact estimate. This is based on your deductible, your plan, where you are in your cycle. This is what you're going to owe.","Now, it's not perfect because there can be an add-on test, there can be something else ordered by a pathologist. But this is going to be an accurate representation to the patient of what they're going to owe and I think that's really going to be helpful. I'm not going to try to make an estimate of what it's going to save or reduce in bad debt. It's part of an ongoing initiative to keep our bad debt flat in percentage and reduce it over time.","On retail, we find that about 65% of our patients are coming from home, and so if you make it convenient for them to be drawn in a setting closer to home, then that makes it easier for them to get their service. And when you combine it with something that's healthcare related, it provides, I think, broad opportunities on a lot of fronts, including as we think about direct patient engagement, Covance \u2013 consenting to trials with Covance, broadening capabilities that can be delivered in a pharmacy. So, again, this is a growth initiative. It's not focused on cost savings, and that's how we think about it.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Under this administration, some fairly substantial changes at the FDA. I'd be interested in your thoughts on how that might impact the CRO business.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think if you believe what you read in the papers, it could be everything from complete revamp to nothing, and I think it's just way too early to even think about that until we have some guidance from HHS and some idea about who the commissioner would be.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, maybe to follow up on your comments earlier about discussions with the shareholders, the stock continues to trade at a fairly wide multiple to your nearest competitor. So, I guess I'd just be interested in your thoughts on that. Is that something you pay attention to, and why do you think that may be the case?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think we're doing what we think is best for the long-term interests of the business. I think we're \u2013 we have demonstrated that the combination of the businesses works. We've demonstrated that we're growing the business on both sides of the equation. And from my perspective, we've demonstrated that the opportunity ahead is great for us.","So, I don't think short-term multiples or \u2013 I'm not a short-termer, I've been around a long time now, and I don't think short-term multiples or short-term multiple dislocations are anything that is beneficial for us to focus on and try to run this business in the best interest of our shareholders.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ashley Polmateer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Ashley Polmateer on for Ricky. I just had a quick question about the Covance changing in the methodology. So, if I look at the $2 billion that you plan to convert from the backlog over the next 12 months and compare it to your guidance, it looks like we're seeing a roughly 70% kind of guaranteed contracts for the next year. Is that about average to what you've seen before? Is this something that tends to fluctuate throughout the year, or is that an average number? And then, just also, as a quick follow-up, how long does it generally take from announced awards to convert into signed contracts? Thank you.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes. It is about the same as in past historical, and in terms of award contract, varies by the individual businesses, but you should have in the neighborhood of two-quarter kind of conversions. And in some cases, certain customers will go to contract on award time, and then others will have a lengthy dialogue between the award and then the contractuals. So, it does vary by customer. And as we said before, the early development has a faster conversion rate than the clinical and the lab space.","Ashley Polmateer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Question on NIPT, just looking for an update on how Sequenom is doing and how you're currently thinking about the opportunity in average risk NIPT testing.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Isaac, it's Dave. Good morning. We're very pleased with Sequenom, with the growth and with how well it's integrated into our women's health portfolio and what we perceive to be market share gains in NIPT. As you know, average risk coverage from payers is expanding. We think that's a promising trend as well as the opportunity to add capabilities to the Sequenom platform.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And just as you think about the size of the average risk, I mean, what's going to take for it to really materialize? Can you maybe map out a couple key initiatives that you are working on to make that a reality?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I think, I mean, obviously, it's been supported now by professional societies. I think patient advocacy groups are picking up on the value. So, it's really a question of payer acceptance. And we continue to speak with medical leadership at all of our key payers in terms of broadening the NIPT capabilities to average risk because of the \u2013 obviously the opportunity to avoid long-term systemic costs down the road.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Dave, just a quick question on PAMA, from what you guys are seeing at either LabCorp or at the ACLA, any updates or color you can share on hospital participation and any change in views on where you think PAMA would shake out, rate-wise? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So, I don't have a lot to add here. We don't know specifically nor does ACLA how many more labs are captured or how many hospitals are captured under the expanded definition of applicable labs. We are submitting data. There have been a number of ACLA engagements with CMS about the data that's to be submitted and the interpretation of the rule. And so, as soon as we have more clarity and an update, we'll provide it to you.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right. Got it. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about your interest level in liquid biopsy, and can you maybe just characterize the degree to which you're pursuing partnerships or exploring potential acquisitions in that space? And then, related to that, I know you acquired Sequenom. And Sequenom, I believe, had some capabilities there. Can you comment on whether or not you think Sequenom can provide a valid liquid biopsy strategy?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So, we're quite interested in liquid biopsy and see it as an attractive opportunity. On the Covance side, we do have a partnership with one of our valued partners around validating and implementing liquid biopsy. You're correct that Sequenom had begun developing liquid biopsy technology, and it was kind of shelved prior to the acquisition. And we have reinitiated that to look at whether it provides us with a viable option that we can scale and develop.","There are literally hundreds of liquid biopsy providers and companies of all sizes and shapes. So, we continue to look at and evaluate them as to which ones would be the best partner or partners for us. At the same time, pursuing the Sequenom option is an internal opportunity.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Pima Anuba (01:15:02) with Bank of America.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you very much. Can you hear me okay?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks. Morning, Dave and Glenn. So, first of all, thank you for reiterating the commitment to investment grade credit ratings, that's great. And all the color on leverage targets. One question we often get from investors is, if there is a business reason, why LabCorp has to be rated at investment grade, or is it more about gaining access to capital at attractive levels?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, from my perspective, it's been a pretty fundamental principle that we want to maintain investment grade. It is access to capital markets. It's also favorability where we access those markets \u2013 of what we pay and what it costs us to take on debt, and I also think it's just responsible management of the balance sheet. And when we say investment grade, it helps frame for management we need to balance sheet responsibly and deploy our capital wisely to maintain that rating. So, that's my perspective. Glenn may have something to add on top of that.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, I \u2013 just other than I agree, we enjoy obviously great access to low cost capital, given the strength of sustainability of our free cash flow, don't read into being below investment grade as a constraint. I mean we can obviously lever up the balance sheet as we have for the appropriate strategic investments. And given a substantial cash flow that we generate and obviously continue to make investments in our business make investments in acquisitions and return capital to our shareholders.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. King for closing remarks.","David P.

I'll also update our 2013 guidance.","First, cash flow. Our cash flow continues to be solid, although in the quarter it was negatively impacted by delays and denials of coverage for existing tests by some payors after implementation of recently adopted molecular pathology codes. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2013, was $597.8 million. DSO at the end of June was 50 days, unchanged from year end. During the quarter, our bad debt remained 4.3%.","Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 3.1% year-over-year in the second quarter. During the quarter, total company volume increased 5%. Organic volume increased 1.4% year-over-year. Revenue per requisition decreased 1.8% year-over-year. Managed care pricing remained stable, but revenue per requisition decreased due to previously discussed Medicare payment reductions, delays and denials of coverage for existing tests by some payors after implementation of recently adopted molecular pathology codes, the implementation of sequestration on April 1, 2013, and strong growth in our drugs of abuse testing. Dave will discuss the molecular pathology payment issues in his remarks. Growth from our MEDTOX acquisition has exceeded our expectations. And while the strong performance has positively impacted revenue, volume and profitability, it has negatively impacted revenue per requisition.","Third, margin. For the second quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 18.8% compared to 19.7% in the second quarter of 2012. Margins were negatively affected by the previously discussed factors.","Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of June, we had cash of $111.3 million and $225 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion credit facility. During the second quarter, we repurchased $362 million of stock, representing 3.7 million shares. At the end of June, $592.1 million of repurchased authorization remained under our share repurchase program. Our increased share repurchase activity during the second quarter reflects our continued disciplined capital allocation program and commitment to return capital to our shareholders.","This morning, we updated our 2013 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of approximately 2% to 3%; adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, of $6.90 to $7.10, which includes a negative impact of approximately $0.35 due to Medicare payment reductions and which excludes the impact of any share repurchase activity after June 30, 2013; operating cash flow of approximately $825 million to $850 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $200 million to $220 million. Our capital expenditure guidance is higher than historical levels due to near-term investments in facility consolidation and replacement of a major testing platform.","I will now turn the call over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Brad. We're very pleased with our second quarter results. During the quarter, we grew revenue approximately 3.1%. We grew volume, 5%, and organic volume, 1.4%. We maintained pricing discipline, and we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of $362 million of our stock, representing 3.7 million shares.","I would now like to review the payment landscape in general. We are pleased that we have continued our disciplined approach to managed care pricing. The government payment situation, however, is quite challenging. We were absorbing approximately $55 million in payment reductions in 2013 due to Medicare fee schedule reductions, from sequestration, the 88305 reduction and other reductions. In a recently released proposed physician fee schedule rule, CMS proposed to broadly update the clinical lab fee schedule, which has already been cut by approximately 5% this year alone and by nearly 8% cumulatively since the beginning of 2010, and to make a significant change in the calculation of payment rates for flow cytometry, FISH, IHC and other critical laboratory services paid from the physician fee schedule. Most of these tests are used for the diagnosis and monitoring of critically ill cancer patients, and they are essential to patients receiving proper and appropriate care. CMS revised payment for these critical tests by using the hospital OPPS as a comparator to current physician fee schedule payment rates and proposing to pay the lower of the two. CMS' reasoning in proposing this change is fundamentally flawed.","The change in methodology, if implemented, will dramatically reduce payment to community pathologists, independent labs, hospital outreach labs and all other labs providing vital services to cancer patients. It will be detrimental to patient care into every laboratory, large and small. The change is unmerited and must not be implemented. And the laboratory community, the pathology community, the physician community and the diagnostics community are united in working to prevent this assault on cancer patients and the laboratories that serve them.","Furthermore, our payment experience with respect to the newly -- to the recently implemented molecular pathology codes has been disappointing. During 2012, we told investors that we believe the pricing of these codes would have little impact on LabCorp pricing. On reviewing the pricing established for these codes, our belief proved correct. Nonetheless, during the first quarter of this year, we experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of these codes among various payors, including Medicaid, Medicare and commercial carriers. These delays were not surprising, given the extent of the impacted procedures. Because we expected that these delays will be properly resolved and have little impact for the full year, we did not highlight them for investors on our first quarter earnings call in April. Since our last conference call, however, several noncommercial payors have still not priced key molecular codes, and a number of these payors have informed us that they will no longer cover and pay for tests that they have always covered and paid for, including cancer markers and genetic analysis. Further, several payors are requiring additional information to process claims or have implemented prior authorization policies. Many commercial payors are only now becoming aware of the impact of their claim at us, which impede patient access to services that previously were covered and paid for.","These decisions are largely being made ad hoc, not pursuant to any properly promulgated coverage policies. They are contrary to long-established standards of care and will ultimately be harmful to patients. For example, we received non-covered responses from a number of state Medicaid organizations for carrier testing and prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis, fragile X and SMA testing, which are standard of care and which are called for within guidelines set by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American College of Medical Genetics. These genetic profiles and full gene sequencing tests offered by LabCorp and many other independent hospital-based and academic labs are critical to the health and welfare of our patients. Failing to cover and pay for these tests will lead to curtailment of services to beneficiaries and ultimately to higher, not lower, health care costs. It is particularly troubling that state governments are taking positions that not only harm all laboratories but also limit care available to the most vulnerable and underserved population. And that the federal TRICARE program is taking positions that harm all laboratories and limit care to our active-duty military and their families.","We are working diligently with payors to address these issues, and ACLA and our industry colleagues are fully engaged. We trust that reason will prevail here and believe that these payors will ultimately cover molecular diagnostic testing as they had in the past. The delays and denials of coverage for these existing and previously covered tests had a negative impact on revenue, price, operating income, adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, and cash flow in the first half of this year and is incorporated into our updated guidance for the full year.","Again, it is our expectation that we will receive appropriate payment for our services and that these unprecedented nonpayment policies will be reversed, which would result in upside to our guidance. The laboratory industry is being harmed, and make no mistake, the harm is not only to LabCorp, it is to hospital labs, academic labs and independent labs, small and large. Our industry cannot and should not be expected to provide critical services to patients without being paid.","I would now like to update our progress on each aspect of our Five Pillar Strategy. The first pillar of our strategy is that we deploy capital to investments that enhance our business and return capital to shareholders. The performance of our MEDTOX business continues to exceed our expectations, and we are particularly pleased with the growth of our drugs of abuse business. The integration is proceeding as anticipated and is nearly complete. MEDTOX provides us with an excellent opportunity to diversify our payor and testing mix, and we remain excited about the opportunity to grow this business.","Earlier this year, we announced a target leverage ratio of 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. Our share repurchase activity during the second quarter brought us to a leverage ratio of 1.9x net debt to EBITDA, a tangible step for achieving this goal. We also continued to deploy capital to small strategic acquisitions that expand our test menu and geographic footprint.","The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. We continue to develop and implement new population health analytics modules that provide business intelligence tools to hospitals, physician practices and ACOs. These tools assist customers in their compliance in reporting requirements with respect to efficient management of their productivity, quality and patient outcome efforts. We also continue to organize and manage a large amount of patient data, and we expect to use population health insights to improve patient care. These industry-leading, data-driven services position LabCorp as a trusted partner to health care stakeholders, providing the knowledge to optimize decision-making, improve health outcomes and reduce treatment costs. Looking ahead, we will continue to add new analytic offerings at the point-of-lab order and result delivery to enhance the physician experience and patient care.","The third pillar of our strategy is to continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. The Propel installation on our Burlington campus is complete, and it is currently splitting and sorting approximately 75% of our Atlantic division volume. We expect that Propel will process 100% of this volume by the end of July, and we intend to install the system in other labs over time. Propel represents a significant financial investment in innovation and will help decrease our labor expense and increase throughput and accuracy.","Construction continues on our new Phoenix campus and we intend to initiate operations within this 240,000 square foot facility later this fall. The campus will initially consolidate 4 laboratories and will be used for further consolidation activity over the next few years.","The fourth pillar of our strategy is to continue scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We introduced new tests and collaborate with leading companies and academic institutions to provide our physicians and patients with the most scientifically advanced testing in our industry. We realized that investors have great interest in the recent Supreme Court ruling related to BRCA analysis. We intend to enter the BRCA testing market. At this point, we believe the ruling will have a net positive impact on our business with new opportunities the ruling likely provides.","The fifth pillar of our strategy is to integrate our offerings into emerging health care delivery models. We continue to develop LabCorp Beacon, BeaconLBS, Beacon Analytics and decision support tools to expand our capabilities and create new value-added products and services for our customers. These tools give us access to additional data beyond the clinical laboratory data we have, allowing us to provide an integrated view of the patient and deliver it to the physician's desktop. We will use all of these capabilities to provide critical insights to support diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the patient's clinical condition. We will also continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our data gathering and analytics capabilities and to use them as tools, both to grow our existing business and create new sources of revenue. The critical components of success in the post-reform era with be quality, efficiency and a role in improving patient outcomes. LabCorp is uniquely positioned to meet these needs in the months and years to come.","Now Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.","Stephen Anderson","Thank you, Dave. \"Can you describe the impact of Medicare payment cuts in 2013?\"","The Affordable Care Act baseline for the 2013 update to the clinical lab fee schedule was negative 0.95%. And the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act re-baselined the fee schedule an additional 2% lower. These fee schedule reductions became effective on January 1, 2013. Due to mandatory sequestration, we received an additional 2% reduction to the clinical lab fee schedule and a separate 2% reduction to the physician fee schedule effective April 1, 2013. We are also experiencing a variety of other government payment reductions, including the reduction to CPT code 88305 and the full year impact of the TC Grandfather Clause. Summed together, we continue to estimate that these payment reductions will lower our 2013 EPS by approximately $0.35, which is already incorporated into our guidance.","\"Why are capital expenditures expected to be so high in 2013?\"","We typically spend approximately 3% of revenue on capital expenditures. As Brad previously mentioned, our capital expenditure increase in 2013 is driven by near-term investments in facility consolidation and replacement of a major testing platform.","\"Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing?\"","For the year, approximately 38% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. As we reiterated last quarter, our goal is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 45% of our revenue within the next 3 to 5 years.","In conclusion, I'd like to mention that earlier this quarter, we provided over $1 million worth of laboratory instruments to the government of Mozambique as part of a humanitarian aid effort. Mozambique is recovering from 30 years of Civil War, which destroyed a majority of the country's schools and hospitals. With the Democratic government in place, Mozambique is striving to reestablish health care delivery for its 22 million people. As in many others sub-Saharan African countries, Mozambique's population suffers from poverty, a high neonatal mortality rate, low life expectancy and a high incidence of infectious disease such as HIV and malaria. The equipment provided by LabCorp supplements aid that Mozambique receives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, the Mozambique Healthcare Consortium; UnitedHealth Group and other public and private aid groups. We work closely with the Mozambican branch of the CDC to place this equipment in the country's national health labs and central reference hospitals to improve the diagnostic and patient management capabilities of the country's health care practitioners. These instruments and the associated training provided by LabCorp will contribute to improve health care and quality of life for a truly needy population.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve. Thank you very much for listening. We are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, how many course do you have to get payment back from some of these payors that denied you? And maybe more importantly, what's a reasonable time frame for recovery?","David P. King","Bob, let's separate it into the commercial, the Medicaid and then TRICARE. So with commercial payors, this is a negotiated process. As we mentioned, many of them incorporated these payment policies without the realization of the impact that would -- that it would have on the claim filing process, a lot of paper claims, a lot of additional information and the impact on patients. And so most of it is just a question of sitting down and talking with them, explaining the circumstances and then we get the coverage issues resolved. With the Medicaids, a couple of the key Medicaids still have not priced the codes, so they told us they're going to pay for the tests but they still haven't priced the codes and these are a couple of sizable Medicaids. And we have been -- we have a commitment that they will price the codes within the third quarter, but obviously claims are not going to be paid until the codes are priced. There are a couple of Medicaids that have said they are not going to pay for this testing even though they have paid for it in the past and they have covered it in the past because either they call it new tests or because of budgetary constraints. On those, it's dealing with the Medicaids, it's getting ACLA involved, and ACLA is fully engaged in this as are our other industry colleagues and it's also potentially legislative and executive remedies in those particular states. And finally, with TRICARE, initially, TRICARE placed cystic fibrosis on its no-pay code list. Our understanding is that after some inquiries from us and others, that the code is off the list but it still hasn't been priced, so we're back in the situation that we have to wait for them to price the code. So as you can tell from that discussion, the timing is somewhat uncertain. We do expect the -- we're optimistic that the commercial ones, for the most part, will be resolved within the year. Whether some of the governmental ones go over into next year, we just have no way of knowing, and that's part of the reason we say as these get resolved, they provide additional upside to the guidance because we've incorporated the view that we stated here into how we think about guidance for the rest of the year.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And has this triggered, from your standpoint -- I mean, other labs are seeing this as well, you have this factor plus some of the cuts and proposals going forward. I mean, how is this changing the M&A pipeline for you? Is it too early to call at this point? Or are you seeing more activity as a net result of this?","David P. King","I think it's a little bit early to call, but the pipeline continues to be quite robust and there are good opportunities out there for us in a variety of areas. When you think about nonpayment for molecular codes, you think about cuts to 88305. There are a number of either specialized laboratories or laboratories with broad exposure to Medicare in these payment areas that are either thinking about entering the acquisition market or are already in the market.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Tom Gallucci.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, just following up on a couple of Bob's questions there. Can you just help me explain sort of how you're handling the revenues and related -- and to the molecular testing that's not getting paid for at this point? I mean, the DSOs didn't really go up in the bad debt. It didn't really go up, so you said you got it all factored in. But how is that actually flowing through? And is there any way to sort of frame the magnitude of what we're talking about?","William B. Hayes","Tom, it's Brad. The way it's flowing through and manifesting itself is in price. These kinds of adjustments, we have historically considered noncoverage items and items where payors don't pay for certain things as revenue adjustments, so that's where they're showing up. And while the DSO was flat, we expected it to be down. And if we look at why it's not down, this particular item for the delays and the nonpayment are exactly what's causing it.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And is there any way to frame sort of the magnitude of what we're talking about here relative to, I don't know, the overall company, whether it's revenue or test or any other perspective?","William B. Hayes","Yes, what I would say is it's about 4% of our revenue that's affected by this entire process. Our molecular pathology revenue is a little bit higher, but some of it's commercial billed and capitated so it doesn't really fall into this CPT code-related process, so it's about 4% of revenue. And then a subset of that is what we're having the difficulty with here. We're not going to give a specific number about what we've seen in the first quarter and expect for the back half of the year because as Dave mentioned, we're fighting this and we hope to get it reversed because it's really not merited. And when we look at price year-over-year, the 1.8% that we reported, if you take into account sequestration and these changes and some of the other factors that we talked about, those are the issues that are resulting in that price.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful, Brad. And then, I guess, just more broadly on the acquisition front, I guess, Bob asked about the reimbursement changes affecting the pipeline. Dave, I know you've talked about diversifying revenue streams a bit, so maybe areas that are outside of some of these sectors that are being hit by reimbursement. Your drug testing did very well in the quarter, I think that's the idea in that business. It doesn't have exposure to some of this stuff. Can you talk about maybe where you are in the process or what the pipelines might look like for you to continue to expand into sort of areas outside of some of the Medicare, Medicaid areas that have the more pressure?","David P. King","Yes, Tom. I think if you look at the key acquisitions that we've done in the last couple of years, we made an acquisition that gave us greater international capability in our pharma services, clinical trials, central lab business. That is not exposed to government reimbursement. It's well priced. And we've been very, very pleased with that because that business continues to expand as does the clinical trial business that is -- that comes in through monograms. Our paternity and forensic testing area where we made the Orchid acquisition, that not only gave us exposure to some private revenue and some nongovernmental revenue, but also to some international revenue with the U.K. and now we're getting some work in that business out of the Middle East. MEDTOX is a commercial pay. It's a -- typically an employer pay clinical trials and commercial pay business. There's essentially no exposure to government. So we are continuing to look at acquisitions that will help us diversify the revenue base. We have looked at and decided not to make some acquisitions, for example, in pathology where we think we would be further exposing ourselves to these kinds of issues. And then we continue to look, as I mentioned in speaking about Pillar Five, in ways that we can take our data and that we can tuck things in that help us create potential revenue streams out of the data and the analytics. So I think there's a -- I think we've had a broad approach to broadening the revenue base, and at the same time, sticking close to our knitting in terms of businesses that we fundamentally understand that know how to run and that fit our long-term strategic priorities.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Was hoping maybe you can give a little bit more color on your organic volume growth, which seems to be pretty good. A number of operators, both, I guess, other competing labs and even some of the acute care guys have noted that physician office visits were weak and overall volume seemed to be pretty weak. So what do you attribute it to? Is it share gains? Or how would you characterize it?","David P. King","Gary, it's Dave. I think, first of all, MEDTOX, the drugs of abuse testing, the pay management business, all have done extremely well. Second of all, I attribute it to good execution. I mean, sales execution, service execution, the investments that we've made in getting results back to physicians earlier in interfaces, there's -- I wish we had some secret. We don't have a secret. Our secret is we have a terrific test menu. We're very focused on execution on both the sales and service side of the business and the kudos are to our organization for executing on our priorities.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe could you update us on the status of renegotiation of any of your large commercial contracts?","David P. King","So we renewed the Cigna contract and the Humana contract. We've made progress. It's still under discussion.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe one housekeeping item. Do you give the share count at the end of the quarter?","William B. Hayes","Gary, it will be in the Q, which we'll file shortly.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser and he's from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Guys, can you talk a little bit about your views on benefit from ACA Medicaid expansion next year given the change to the employer mandate and just kind of like the discussion on the lower potential enrollment?","David P. King","It's Dave. We've said all along there's a lot of moving parts in the ACA and continue to believe there are a lot of moving parts in the ACA. I think that the ACA will be a net positive for us because there will be more people covered by insurance, whether through government programs, exchanges or employer base. I don't think we can quantify it today because, as you say, there are questions about which Medicaids will expand and how significant they will be. And there are questions about the readiness of the exchanges. There was the delay in the employer mandate and in a couple of other regulations that now are not going to take effect apparently until 2015. So again, net positive, we expect to see some benefit next year but certainly not factoring it in as a game changer as we think about 2014.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then to clarify the comments that you made on the pricing, where the negative pricing trends are really a factor of the changes in molecular diagnostic, et cetera. Suggest to kind of like ask it in a more targeted way, excluding these issues that you mentioned, would your price metric be in positive territory, similar to where it was in 1Q '13?","David P. King","Well, there are a number of moving parts in price, and the growth in drugs of abuse testing, while it's positive to revenue, it's positive to volume and it's positive to margin, is negative to price because it's at a lower price point than our typical patient encounter. Everything else that was involved in price had to do with the government reductions. So the Medicare reductions that we talked about, the sequestration and then, as we mentioned, MoPath, which we don't view as a long-term reduction but certainly has an impact in this quarter. So I just -- I don't think it's constructive to try to break down every bit and bob of pricing. I think what we can say is we maintained price discipline with managed care, and managed care pricing was flat, as we've said. And the price impact is coming from the factors we've enumerated.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just last follow-up on the organic volume growth because, obviously, it seems that you're gaining share, right? You're growing faster than what the industry has grown this quarter. So -- and I understand it's on execution in sales and service. But can you give us any color on where it's coming from, i.e. is it coming from the hospitals where I think there's a lot of concern as hospitals are in-sourcing? Or is it just coming from the physician market where you're just gaining share from your independent lab peers?","David P. King","Well, I think it's coming from, as we mentioned, drugs of abuse and pain management. I think it's coming from the physician market, and then I think it's coming from hospital reference business. Those are probably the 3 biggest areas in which we're seeing volume pickups.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And the drugs of abuse, just to make sure that I'm not confusing it, is the drug of abuse, that's tied to the MEDTOX acquisition? Or is it also just above and beyond that?","David P. King","It's both. It's MEDTOX. It's our, what we call our occupational testing business, and it's the pain management component of both of those businesses.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Amanda Murphy and she's from William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just had a quick follow-up on the reimbursement discussion. So I may be too early yet, but have you seen any change in the physician in-sourcing dynamic with the cuts to the code 88305 from last year? And then just as a follow-up to that, they've obviously targeted physician flow this year. And I'm curious, there doesn't seem to be codes that are quite as exposed to that physician in-sourcing dynamic. So curious if you have any insight into why they're going after those particular areas specifically.","David P. King","Amanda, it's Dave. I think we've seen a slowing of the physician in-sourcing trend for sure since 88305 and believe there was also a report that came out about utilization after physician in-sourcing that -- in the last couple of weeks that suggested that physician in-sourcing led to higher utilization. So I think the point has been made to CMS about the impact of physician in-sourcing and the trend does seem to be mitigated. On the flow and the FISH, the IHC and the other pathology codes, we don't have a good understanding of why CMS has singled those out on the physician fee schedule, although it's, I think the number is 26% approximately, reduction across the board on physician fee schedule pathology codes. When you look at flow and FISH, I mean, the reductions are more in the 60% and 70% range. So we don't know why those have been signaled -- have been singled out. And again, the reasoning behind equating those to the hospital OPPS is completely erroneous, and we will fight to the end that those said proposed reductions not be implemented. It is bad for laboratories, but more fundamentally, it is bad for cancer patients and it's going to have a terrible effect on the cancer patient population.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up to Ricky's question on the hospital side of the world. So in terms of the opportunity that you have there to increase your -- whether it be outsourcing, work from hospitals or working with them on a partnership level, I mean, is that market, one, that's underserved at this point? Or is it that -- I'm just trying to figure out where the growth is coming from. Is it from volumes going more to hospitals as they're buying the doc practices? Or are you actually gaining share from existing competitors in that market?","David P. King","Well, I think it's always risky to say that you're gaining share. I think the numbers speak for themselves. I think the hospital changes that we're seeing with physician in-sourcing do lead many hospitals to send out more testing because they are bringing in more testing. And as they bring in complex testing, they can't perform it themselves so they send it out. So I do think that accounts for some of the trend in terms of our growth in the hospital business.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And just last one from me in terms of MEDTOX. I'm just curious if you can give a little more color on -- it seems like that's turning above your expectations in terms of growth. And then just how that flows through in terms of guidance or how to think about that through the remainder of the year?","David P. King","Well, I don't think we've ever talked about the P&Ls of particular acquisitions and so we're certainly not going to do that now. MEDTOX is doing better than we expected from a revenue and a profitability perspective. As you know, the guidance incorporates all the moving pieces in the business in a wide range of outcomes and so it's -- there's nothing we can really specify as to how MEDTOX plays in the guidance other than to say we're very pleased with the performance.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Darren Lehrich who's from Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I just wanted to follow up on the Medicare PFS proposal. Just as it relates to 2014, can you update us, please, on what your exposure is to fee schedule as a percentage of revenue and maybe just help us think a little bit more about what that proposal means?","David P. King","Darren, it's Dave. The Medicare physician fee schedule revenue in 2012 was 1.7% of total revenue. Now it will be less this year because of some of the payment reductions that have already been implemented. But if these reductions were to be implemented, as proposed in the rule, you could simply, on average, take the -- call it 1.5% of revenue and multiply that by negative 26.7% and you'd be in the ballpark of what the impact would be.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So you don't think your mix is necessarily different than what the 26% would imply, given what you said about FISH and flow being higher than that?","David P. King","No.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then as it relates to molecular diagnostics issue, can you just remind us -- my recollection was that this is in the domain of the max and it's been pretty byzantine in terms of how they've been pricing codes and approving codes. But for 2014 or some point in the future, it moves into the domain of the clinical lab fee schedule and so it comes back to Medicare on more of a federal level. Is that how it's currently envisioned? And do you think that's 2014? And I guess, the real question here is, what would that mean then for the states and some of these other payors to the extent that some of those codes aren't approved?","David P. King","Well, if I understand the question, which I have to -- I'm not sure I do, but if I understand the question, the answer is the pricing has been done by individual Medicare carriers on a gap-fill basis. The process has been slow, and it has been nontransparent in the sense that we don't know what the inputs are into the pricing. We have offered to try to help provide inputs, and generally, our offers of helping with inputs have been declined by the carriers, the Medicare carriers. And they have established pricing, probably led by Palmetto, and then a number of others have followed along. As we said throughout the year last year, the actual prices set would not have had a major impact on us because they're not terribly different from the prices that we were previously receiving. The issue was the delay in setting the prices and then some of the coverage decisions are not the coverage changes that we've made reference to in the call. I believe CMS will have greater authority over these prices in 2014 because I believe after they've been in place for a year, CMS has the ability to review them. But we had our work cut out for the rest of 2013 and that's what we're focused on.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, yes. It just would obviously seem like you'd have more leverage if you're dealing with one and even -- than multiples, so that's helpful. Then just the last question here is just on testing platforms. First, was hoping you might expand a little bit more on your BRCA comment. You intend to enter the market based on what you said, Dave. When do you think that will occur? And then any kind of just broad-brush comment we could get on the FC market, how you see that tracking and what do you think that market is doing? Is it accelerating? Is it just -- has it been stable the first half? Any comments there will be great.","David P. King","Sure. On BRCA, we don't have a specific time frame for entering the market. We actually are capable of performing the test today under current methodologies, but we're looking at what's the best methodology and what's the right timing. And as you probably saw, even post the Supreme Court decision, there's been another suit filed against the lab performing BRCA so this is not entirely free from controversy in spite of the Supreme Court's decision. We're going to make a reasoned decision about when we enter the market and what methodology we use and what price we offer and all I can say stayed tuned in terms of our timing there. On hepatitis C, it's been one of the nice drivers of growth year-over-year. The screening recommendations from the CDC have certainly given us some help. In addition, our hepatitis C expertise coming out of the terrific R&D that we do at Monogram and the clinical trials for the new hepatitis C drugs have all been very strong for us there and so we're pleased. We talked for long term about the opportunity in hepatitis C and we needed a catalyst in those guidelines for the catalyst.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","What share do you think you have in the hep C market?","David P. King","Just couldn't even begin to estimate.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Kevin Ellich and he comes from Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions. I guess, first, on the 5% volume growth, if 1.4% came organically, is it safe to assume the remainder came from MEDTOX? Or was there anything else?","William B. Hayes","Kevin, this is Brad. That's correct. That's the way we look at it.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then on the reduced operating cash flow guidance, was that only due to the delays and denials from the MoPath codes? Or was there anything else included in that?","William B. Hayes","I would say that makes up the substantial part of that thinking.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Got it. Appreciate it. And then, Dave, I was just kind of wondering if -- are you guys seeing any increased volume coming from wellness testing as more employers adopt these various programs?","David P. King","Kevin, it's Dave. I think the answer is yes. We've had requests from a number of employers and plans, for example, to be able to do biometric testing in our patient service centers' point of service. So I think the answer is yes. Both wellness and pain management have been growers for us in the last couple of quarters.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And would that be lower-priced business, all things considering?","David P. King","Yes, probably.","So guys, we have 10 minutes -- excuse me, Michelle, we have 10 minutes before the hour. We have about 7 people in the queue so let\u2019s try to make sure the questions we are asking are new and unique so that we can limit the call to an hour. Thank you.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you maybe just show a little light on anything you're seeing with regards to the competitive environment against hospital labs ahead of ACA? And specifically, do you see any near-term opportunity to pick up a little bit of market share and maybe you can kind of compare that against the dynamic you see where hospitals may be trying to bring more of their own business in?","David P. King","Isaac, it's Dave. I think, as we have said, hospitals have been acquiring physician groups, which is -- which are bringing lab services in. I would say at the same time, we're seeing hospitals facing some of the similar pricing environment, particularly government pricing environment, that we're seeing and it's reflected in our numbers and in everybody else's numbers. And so I think there's a greater interest in things like laboratory management services that help them reduce their costs than there has been historically. And we've seen very good growth in laboratory management relationships with hospitals throughout the last, probably, 3 quarters and expect that to continue.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just want to follow up on the cost side of things. Can you give us a sense maybe of what kind of savings you think you can target here on the sourcing and supply chain side of things? And specifically, I'm referring to some of the vendor consolidation that your main competitor has undertaken recently. I'm just trying to sense -- get a sense of what you think your relative opportunity is on that side.","David P. King","Yes, I think our opportunity there is relatively small. We've done those things a long time ago, so we have standard national contracts for almost all of our major supplies from gloves to dry ice, you name it. And so I don't think there's a lot of upside to further supply chain rationalization because, as I say, we've -- we undertook that process about 4 years ago.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Gavin Weiss and he's from JPMorgan.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to clarify, SG&A in the quarter came in a little bit below our expectations and showed the better trend than in the first quarter. Is there anything specific there that's driving that improvement? And how should we think about that going forward?","William B. Hayes","I would say just, this is Brad, continued integration of some acquisitions from last year. No real change to mention and bad debt driving that trend and it's sustainable. So there's nothing unusual driving it and we think that trend should continue.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then Dave, you talked about the increased use of Propel in your North Carolina facility. How should we think about that technology in terms of the margin profile? Is there a point where that becomes a significant impact? Or is it more just incremental?","David P. King","As I mentioned, it's a significant financial investment in efficiency and innovation. And from a margin perspective, we should think of that -- we should think of it as it certainly is labor saving. But a lot of the times, what we do with those labor savings is that we move those positions into front-line positions so that we can continue the emphasis on sales and service that we talked about earlier in the call. So we haven't quantified it, and at the point when we have it up and running in our 8 labs, we will be able to quantify it. It will help with margin but I'd like to think of it as it more helps us to offset some of the pressures in the other direction than you would see a dramatic impact on margins overall.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, a numbers question. On the operating cash flow guidance, it looks like you reduced that about $50 million from previous range, anything behind that worth highlighting?","David P. King","It's Dave. As Brad stated, that is essentially due to our expectations for the timing of payment for the molecular pathology issues that we've discussed.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just quickly on the -- if I look at your guidance for the back half, you're at -- you're looking at it for $3.47 in the back half versus the $3.53 of non year-to-date. I know sequestration, you get 2 quarters of that in the back half versus one in the early part, but you've also got the benefit of the buyback kicking in. I know we've talked about a lot of different items on the call so far but if you look at the overall macro environment, is there any reason? Are you thinking it will be a little tougher in the back half? Or would you describe that as your normal seasonal pattern, even taking into account the buyback benefit?","William B. Hayes","A.J., it's Brad. I would say it's normal seasonal. I mean, the fourth quarter is a tough EPS quarter just given the holidays and everything. So as I look at the calendarization of our expectations, I don't see anything unusual in it.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And no change in the macro basically from what you guys...","William B. Hayes","Not thinking of any at this point.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Dane Leone from Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","I know it's early days since the Supreme Court ruling and you're still trying to figure out a strategy with BRCA. But I think it would be helpful, especially in historical context of your comments on where you ultimately think the growth potential of the lab industry is, what type of scope and potential is there for the broader implications of the ruling? And what type of content could that ultimately unlock for LabCorp as it continues to push into a more esoteric product mix?","David P. King","It's Dave, Dane. I think that, as we said, the BRCA decision in and of itself unlock certain market opportunity to launch a -- the BRCA test more fundamentally, or more broadly, it opens up opportunities in other areas that have been patent protected and it raises the question of whether other things that have patent protection will continue to have that patent protection over time. So as we think about next-generation sequencing, as we think about the ability to do broader genetic testing, longer reads, sequence-full genes and add the content to that, the interpretive content of that which is part of what we're developing in the second and fifth pillar, I think the opportunity is very promising for us. It would be really -- just it wouldn't make sense to try to quantify that now because the uncertainty is too great, but we definitely view it as a long-term positive and is fitting nicely with our strategic focus.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Dave, just a couple of quick questions. You only spent a fair amount of time on this call talking about the government reimbursement environment and appropriately so. But I'm just kind of curious, could you comment on the commercial environment? You made some comments earlier on, talking about that you have a disciplined approach to pricing and you renewed Cigna and is currently in negotiations with Humana. Could you give us a sense for how those negotiations are going? And do you -- are you nervous at all about any vulnerability on the commercial front, given all the potential pressure on the government side?","David P. King","I've said for a long time that the fundamental process of negotiation with commercial payors is they want us to do more for less and we want to be paid more for what we do, so it's a negotiation, and I'm pleased that we have maintained good pricing discipline. I'm pleased that pricing in the quarter on managed care remained stable. And we're going to continue to do the best we can to maintain pricing discipline and keep that trend. We have a long-standing partnership with Humana. We value the relationship and our hope is that we're going to come to contract terms that are good for everybody.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe just really quick. Are you seeing any success or focus on behalf of the commercial payors regarding their efforts to narrow their lab networks?","David P. King","I don't think we're seeing a lot of impact there, Glenn. I think, obviously, there's been a lot of press given to some of the actions that Aetna has taken fairly publicly. But I think the actual, are we going to have more narrow networks? We're just not seeing a lot of it.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti from Maxim Group.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","This will be quick. I was just wondering if you could give the growth rate for drug in abuse testing and also for the esoteric and genomic testing for the quarter, year-over-year?","William B. Hayes","Okay. Esoteric testing for the quarter was up, I believe, 3.5%. The drugs of abuse testing for the quarter...","David P. King","10.6%.","William B. Hayes","It's a race to see who can find it, and Dave found it, 10.6% year-over-year. Now that is excluding the impact of MEDTOX. That's our core drugs of abuse.","David P. King","Exactly.","William B. Hayes","Just as a comparison, in Q1, it was 10.2% on a per day basis, excluding MEDTOX.","Operator","Thank you for your question. I would now like to turn the call over to David King for closing remarks.","David P. King","Thank you very much for listening to our second quarter earnings call, and we wish you a good day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Shantalle, and I will be your facilitator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Steve Anderson. Please proceed, sir.","Stephen Anderson","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. I'm Steve Anderson, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. This morning, we will highlight our progress on our 5-pillar strategy, discuss our third quarter 2014 financial results and update our 2014 guidance.","Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. Please refer to today's press release for replay information.","This morning, the company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information.","Additionally, we refer you to today's press release, which is available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS, free cash flow and adjusted operating income.","I would also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions.","These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the company's financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2013 10-K and will be included in subsequent filings with the SEC. The company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve. Good morning. We are pleased with the strong revenue and volume growth that we have generated this year and believe that the long-term growth prospects for our business and the industry remain great. We employ our 5-pillar strategy to capitalize on these opportunities, and I would now like to highlight our key initiatives within this strategy.","With respect to pillar 1, we deploy our capital to investments that enhance our business and return capital to shareholders. Last month, we announced our acquisition of LipoScience, a premier esoteric laboratory focused on personalized diagnostics for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The NMR LipoProfile test is the only FDA-cleared test for measuring LDL particle numbers, offering actionable information for physicians and patients in the management of cardiovascular disease. Hence, this acquisition will enhance our innovative clinical decision support programs, allowing us to provide broader, differentiated knowledge services to physicians and patients. Furthermore, the novel application of nuclear magnetic resonance technology furthers our leadership in scientific innovation. This transaction is expected to be accretive to LabCorp's earnings in year 1 and to earn its cost of capital by year 3. Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the HSR waiting period for this acquisition, and we expect it to close during the fourth quarter.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $66 million of our shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $228 million. Our cash balance at the end of the third quarter was $576 million, but this cash balance does not reflect any change in our capital allocation philosophy. We anticipate reducing this cash balance in future quarters, continuing to make strategic acquisitions, as well as returning capital to our shareholders.","Under pillar 2, we aim to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. We continue to improve our tools that assist physicians and patients in interpreting test results and optimizing decision-making. To this end, we are partnering with Wolters Kluwer to develop UpToDate adviser for labs, a decision-support resource for clinicians interpreting test results. This partnership equips clinicians with real-time contextual laboratory decision-support content, delivered while the clinician is reviewing results. Similar content will be made available to patients, which will help them to review and understand their lab results. That content will be available through our Patient Portal where registrations now exceed 625,000 patients, and these patients currently review over 120,000 reports via the portal each month. We believe that providing patients with tools that help them understand their health is fundamental to reducing costs and improving outcomes.","With respect to pillar 3, we continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. Our Propel robots in our Burlington and Tampa laboratories continue to drive expense reduction through improvements in throughput and accuracy and to enhance service levels. We remain on schedule to begin the installation of Propel in our Dublin, Ohio facility at the end of this year, and we plan to install Propel in 5 additional facilities over the next 2 years.","We continue to streamline our operations and reduce expenses through facility rationalization. The consolidations of our facilities at Mitchel Field, New York and Monrovia, California into our Connecticut and Santa Fe laboratories, respectively, are now complete. Also, we continue to consolidate services, expand our test offerings and leverage increased capacity in our center for specialty and clinical testing located in Phoenix, Arizona.","We are building significant momentum on our enterprise-wide business process improvement initiative, and we have initiated several projects that will begin to bear fruit in 2015. We are reengineering our business to provide a better operating platform, sustainable long-term savings and a world-class customer experience. We plan to discuss this initiative in detail when we report our year-end results and provide our 2015 guidance in February.","Under pillar 4, we continue our scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We recently launched our informaSeq Prenatal Test, an advanced, non-invasive, next-generation prenatal screening assay that assesses risk for multiple fetal chromosomal abnormalities from a single maternal blood draw. There are testing options for several additional common sex-related abnormalities as part of informaSeq.","We have also recently launched our BRCA Next-Generation Sequencing assay, which provides complete gene sequence analysis of BRCA1 and 2. In combination with our Care Coordination preauthorization service, LabCorp offers an end-to-end program that includes compliance with insurance requirements, comprehensive testing and expert interpretation from our licensed directors and our team of 123 board-certified genetic counselors and 9 medical geneticists.","We also continue to see growth in our companion diagnostic assays that help physicians guide targeted drug therapy. For example, our HCV GenoSure NS3\/4A assay is the first commercially available test to provide drug resistance data for new HCV antivirals.","With respect to pillar 5, we continue our progress in developing knowledge services. Last month, we announced the launch of Enlighten Health Genomics, and later this quarter, Enlighten Health Genomics will introduce ExomeReveal, a whole Exome sequencing testing service. ExomeReveal will provide genome-wide interpretation for children with serious genetic diseases as well as additional diagnostic information for patients of any age. Because evidence increasingly suggests that early genetic diagnosis can improve clinical outcomes, patients with serious genetic conditions require a thorough interpretation of their genome.","We will offer innovative and affordable diagnostic solutions that make genomic testing accessible to support critical clinical diagnoses. We continue to develop all aspects of our Enlighten Health initiative, our decision support programs, our Care Intelligence data analytics programs and our clinical trials business.","Our data and analytics tools help physicians understand their metrics of care delivery and improve compliance with pay-for-performance and population health metrics. Our disease-specific expertise in kidney stone, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and coagulation help physicians tailor specific treatment programs for their patients.","Finally, our clinical trials central lab business serves physicians and patients by working with pharmaceutical companies to create vertical alignment from drug design to identification of unique patient populations that will respond to therapy.","As discussed on our last earnings call, we invested in BeaconLBS in 2011 because we understood that providers need assistance in selecting the right test for their patients and payers need help at appropriately managing the utilization of laboratory testing. After extensive market analysis and an enormous amount of hard work, we invented a tool that helps physicians choose the right test at the right time and helps payers improve quality of care and thoughtfully address concerns about unit cost and trend. UnitedHealthcare launched the innovative Laboratory Benefit Management Program with BeaconLBS in Florida on October 1, and we are pleased with the rollout thus far.","We have positioned LabCorp to grow through the era of health care reform, a time in which quality, efficiency, scale and essential role in improving care delivery and patient outcomes will be the key measures of success. Our 5-pillar strategy will enable us to excel in all of these areas, generating shareholder value for years to come.","Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn to review our financial results.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. Sales for the quarter were $1.6 billion, an increase of 6.1% over last year. The increase in sales was the result of strong volume, measured by requisitions and acquisitions, which was partially offset by price mix and currency. Total volume increased 6.9% over last year, with most of the growth coming organically.","Revenue per requisition decreased 0.7%, of which 0.3% was due to foreign currency translation. Top line growth was spread evenly across our core and esoteric businesses. From a payer perspective, managed care revenue increased the most at roughly 10%, while pricing remained relatively flat. The increase in managed care revenue was driven in part by the Affordable Care Act.","Gross profit for the quarter was $571 million or 36.8% of sales. This compares to gross profit of $548 million or 37.5% of sales last year. The increase in gross profit was due to volume and productivity, which was partially offset by price mix, personnel cost and depreciation.","SG&A for the quarter was $306 million or 19.7% of sales compared to $279 million or 19.1% last year. During the quarter, we incurred $5 million of special charges, primarily related to our business process improvement initiative. The remainder of the increase was due to personnel costs, acquisitions and an increase in bad debt expense. While the bad debt rate was higher than last year, it was down from last quarter, and we expect to continue to make progress on lowering this rate in the future.","During the quarter, we had $6 million of restructuring and special items, primarily due to facility closures and related severance compared to $4 million last year.","Operating income was $241 million or 15.6% of sales compared to $245 million or 16.7% of sales last year. Excluding restructuring and special charges totaling $11 million, adjusted operating income was $253 million or 16.3% of sales compared to $248 million or 17% last year.","Interest expense for the quarter was $26 million compared to $25 million last year. The increase was driven by higher debt balances as a result of our debt financings in the fourth quarter of last year, partially offset by the benefit of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps on a portion of our debt.","The tax rate for the quarter was 37.2% compared to 35.3% last year. The increase in the tax rate over last year was the result of benefits related to discrete items realized in the third quarter of 2013. As a result, net income for the quarter were $137 million or $1.59 per diluted share. This compares to $148 million or $1.63 per diluted share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS was $1.80, unchanged from last year.","We continue to generate strong cash flow. During the quarter, operating cash flow was $176 million compared to $234 million last year, as we used working capital to support strong top line growth. Capital expenditures totaled $53 million, which was essentially unchanged from last year. As a result, free cash flow or cash from operating activities after capital expenditures was $123 million compared to $182 million last year.","As Dave mentioned, during the third quarter, we repurchased $66 million of our stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $228 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $824 million remaining under our Board-authorized share repurchase program.","Our full year guidance for 2014 is for sales growth of approximately 3%. Given our performance in the third quarter and outlook for the year, we have increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance to $6.70 to $6.80. Operating cash flow was targeted at $760 million to $780 million, while capital expenditures are projected to be $200 million to $205 million. As a result, free cash flow is now projected at $555 million to $580 million. The lower free cash flow range is reflective of additional working capital needs to support our strong top line growth, as well as investments associated with our business process improvement initiative and restructuring activities.","This ends our formal remarks, and now we'll be happy to take any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby of Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, can you speak to your expectations for Enlighten Health Genomics and how the money will flow there, what kind of payer support we should see? And also, just what are your plans for the Canadian infrastructure, with some business moving away from you there?","David P. King","Bob, it's Dave. The plans for Enlighten Health Genomics, at least initially, are that the offering will be directed largely toward the self-pay market. So part of the reason that it's under Enlighten Health and part of the reason that it's a broader whole Exome offering than our traditional reproductive genetics business is, as we indicated, is targeting the market for early childhood development, developmental delay and early childhood severe genetic diseases. I'm sure over time, there will involve to be a commercial payer component of that. And our expectations are, given the severity of the disease states that we're looking at that we'll have a successful payment experience even with the commercial payers. With regard to Canada, I'm going to ask Glenn to comment on that, as he is directly involved in the day-to-day handling of that situation, which, as you know, is the Alberta RFP.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yes, Robert, this is Glenn. To your point, we currently are servicing the Alberta Health System, and they did an RFP a while ago and have chosen to go with another company, at least at this stage, to now negotiate a new transaction with them. As you know, we're a minority investor in that company, DynaLIFE. And while the results are not material to us, obviously, we're very disappointed with the decision that's been made by AHS. Having said that, we've not been debriefed yet by them as far as why we didn't go ahead and have our business re-upped. And then there's an appeals process that follows that, should we elect to do that. So getting disappointed with it. We feel Canada is a very attractive market. We are already there outside of just this minority joint venture that we have elsewhere in Canada, and we'll continue to pursue all the options we have to continue to perform business out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Kalenderian - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Josh in for Darren. I'm hoping you can shed some light on your operating leverage and with the increased volume you've been getting, is there any reason why you haven't been getting better operating leverage out of the operating income?","David P. King","Josh, it's Dave. I'll start and then turn it over to Glenn. I mean, I think the obvious answer is that when the difference in operating leverage is the decline in price, so if you look at versus last year, we're down 70 basis points in price. If you add that price differential back in, our operating leverage is basically about the same. When you think about the foundation model, which we've talked about for years, the assumption in the foundation model is that price is flat to slightly up. And you may recall, with the benefit of positive mix, we used to get 50 to 100 basis points of positive price from the -- just from mix-driven price. So when price is flat to increasing, there's great leverage and, obviously, as price is declining, it's more difficult to get leverage because every incremental specimen that comes in the door requires reagents, requires labor, requires infrastructure costs. And in a declining price environment, it's difficult to get leverage. But we are very pleased with the price improvements sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter and from the beginning of the year through this point in the year, and have every reason to expect that, that would continue. Glenn?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","No it's -- maybe I'll just add just a little bit of color because I think that addresses it pretty well. I think where we're pleased is the amount of organic growth that we're experiencing in the company, pleased with the amount of productivity that we're getting through that as we leverage our lab. But as Dave said, when you have price and mix issues, obviously that falls down to the bottom line. In addition, we've had some bad debt rate increase and expense that, again, we think we peaked that on. So as we go forward, we would expect to see that to start to show favorable comps, which will help. Again, I don't know if you're looking at it on an as-adjusted basis, but we also had some restructuring in special items. And to that point, in recognition of the fact that we are seeing the margin squeeze because of pricing, we're really looking at this business process improvement initiative and restructuring in order to continue to leverage our cost structure, which will continue to benefit the company as we go forward.","Joshua Kalenderian - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I could just have one more. Can you guys give us an update on your progress with molecular pathology payment in onset of state Medicaid programs?","David P. King","Yes, it's Dave. We continue to work with the state Medicaid programs we have, and there are some managed Medicaid programs as well that have been challenging for us. While we have made some progress there, the progress has been slower than I would like. So we have now undertaken a review of accounts that are generating a large amount of MoPath volumes and high write-offs and relatively -- other relatively small amounts of other business. And we're starting to shed those accounts because they are generating a large amount of MoPath volumes, high write-offs, so there's a significant amount of expense in performing the MoPath. So we're attacking the problem on both sides, one is continuing to work with the payers and the other is pruning accounts that are basically, in our view, just using the opportunity to send us MoPath with the recognition that we're not going to get reimbursed for it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Per Ostlund of Craig-Hallum.","Per Erik Ostlund - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to ask quickly about the cash balance, it's grown here the last couple of quarters quite nicely. I'm sure some of that here in Q3, you've kind of got that set aside for the LipoScience transaction. But just wondering if we could get your kind of most current thoughts on the appropriate leverage for the company and share repurchase.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yes, sure, Per Ostlund. As Dave made a comment, I guess, in his opening remarks, we do recognize that our cash balances have increased. The good news is, obviously, we continue to generate good free cash flow that's providing that while we continue to pursue acquisitions and do share repurchases. We've not changed our, call it, targeted leverage, the 2.5x debt to EBITDA, which we realize that on a net basis, we would be below that level right now given our cash balances. So we continue to look at opportunities, we continue to expect to redeploy our capital and we would continue to at least expect that, that cash balance will decline over future periods.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dave, I know I asked about this last quarter around BeaconLBS, but just given the things you've highlighted today around the doctor making the right test decision at the right time, et cetera, I'm just curious, if you compare those doctors that are using this versus a similar doctor, are you seeing them doing more lab tests, less lab tests? And what do you think that, that means for the future if you continue to see this roll out to other physicians?","David P. King","Lisa, it's Dave. I think it's too early to draw any conclusions about more lab tests or fewer lab tests from the population of users of BeaconLBS. I would point you to the slide in our investor deck that talks about 20% overutilization of lab tests in certain circumstances and 45% utilization in other common diseases -- sorry, 45% underutilization in other common disease states. So the point is, BeaconLBS is really less about overutilization\/underutilization than it is about choosing the right test for the patient at the right time based on a Q&A that's presented to the physician. So I think as we think about over time and again, refer you to the investor deck, the slide that shows the growth in number of lab tests per patient in the population from 1997 to 2008 and also the increase in lab test per patient per year as patients age, I don't think we're talking about dramatic decreases in volume of laboratory testing as a result of trying to manage cost and trend. I think what we're talking about is exactly what we've always talked about, which is better use of lab testing for diagnostics, better use of the tools to get at the disease state and better use of lab testing in support of precision medicine and personalized care. And that's the goal not only of BeaconLBS, but also of our decision-support programs. It's all about how do we get the right test to the right patient at the right time because we are here for the patient and how do we use lab testing to integrate with other data that will enhance the care that the physician is able to provide to the patient.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about the right tests, can you maybe just give us any update you have around BRCA, as far as what you're seeing around test volumes there?","David P. King","Sure. We're very pleased with BRCA volumes. We've seen very nice, steady growth since the time that we launched it. Moving to the Next-Gen Sequencing platform has enabled us to significantly increase the speed of performing the test. So most of the \"BRCA backlog\" that we have is due to the preauthorization requirements and we wait for preauthorization. But volume continues to grow, the throughput in the lab is excellent and we're very, very pleased with where we are in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier of Maxim Group.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Last quarter, you mentioned that it was hard to identify the benefit from ACA, but there was a slight benefit. Now about 3 months later, it seems that it may have been a greater impact in the quarter. As we look to people getting more coverage next year, should we think about it taking about 3 months for members to get their benefit cards and start utilizing benefits? Or any sort of thoughts on what benefit you'll get next year?","David P. King","Bryan, it's Dave. I think the benefit from ACA has been greater than we have expected from a volume perspective this year. I think if you go back and look at what we said starting in the fourth quarter of last year, that we expected ACA to be relatively neutral, maybe a slight net positive. I mean, obviously, from a volume perspective, I think ACA has contributed to our growth and particularly to the very strong organic growth. I think it's hard to know next year because there are many factors up in the air. Medicaid -- the potential of Medicaid expansion in some additional states, some of the grandfathered plans or the plans that were allowed to be grandfathered for 1 more year that were noncompliant going away and people moving to the exchanges. Patients -- pre-Medicare patients moving to exchanges and even some managed Medicare moving to the exchanges. So I'm hesitant to forecast what it would be, particularly given the inaccuracy of my earlier forecast. But we do see ACA as a net positive in terms of volume. And again, as we have mentioned, there is somewhat of a drag on price due to test mix and also due to payer mix.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","All right. And I know that your guidance does not include future share repurchases or M&A. But could you talk a little bit about what other assumptions are built into your outlook in terms of health care utilization, molecular pathology reimbursement or other key issues that are being built into your outlook?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Bryan, this is Glenn. You're right, for the share repurchases and M&A, we don't after the third quarter, so project that out. But obviously, we continue to be in the market and again, have an acquisition that we announced, albeit would not be material to our fourth quarter results, albeit, hopefully, we do close it in the quarter. The rest of the guidance is based upon just essentially the organic growth that we're seeing. We've given guidance at the top line for the year, so you kind of get an implication of what that means for the fourth quarter. Similarly, we expect to have good operating performance and results in the fourth quarter. I think this was a question earlier with the pressures that we've been having from price and mix, you can see that the comps for the quarter compared to the quarter a year ago, each time the margin differential is narrowing, so we're starting to see that price mix abate a bit. So hopefully, with good volume, we'll start to see good leverage with pricing and mix not impacting as much. We're -- now hopefully, we'll start to see some favorable comps on margins year-over-year.","David P. King","And Bryan, just a thought. Just one other thing. So we're not assuming any improvement in the MoPath, specifically, we're not assuming any improvement in the MoPath payment experience. And we also have not factored in any financial benefit from the enterprise-wide reengineering, although, obviously, the cost side of that is factored in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy of William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the mix conversation. So just given all of your new tests and directions, specifically the NGS testing, is there -- I guess, what are your expectations longer term around mix? I know, obviously, not expecting guidance commentary, but do you think that possibly, we could see an improvement in the -- at least from a tough mix perspective in 2015?","David P. King","Amanda, it's Dave. Yes, I think that if you look at the tests that were launched in the informaSEQ, the various NGS methodologies, the -- all of the infectious disease-related tests that follow on the HCV screening, the Exome business, I mean, all of these are high value. We also were pleased to see that, from a mix perspective, we had an increase in pathology volume this quarter, which, as you know, has been a challenging area for us. So all of these things helped mix. And I think over -- again, all other things being equal, we would expect to see mix improve next year. The unknown in that is that the mix component, particularly of the ACA\/managed Medicaid, is a mix that is more driven towards the -- or more weighted towards the core testing, and so that offsets some of the benefit. And partly, that's because of payment policies of not paying for molecular pathology and genetic testing, and partly, it's just because of patients new in the system are getting tests that are more weighted toward core testing. So there are a lot of moving parts in there, but we continue to strive to return to that 40% esoteric mix and, obviously, over time, we've said 45%, and we think that's a realistic aspiration for ourselves.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then just again on the Next-Gen topic. So I'm wondering, how close are you guys or how much visibility do you have into some of the pricing of the new Next-Gen code for 2015? I guess I'm wondering, is there a risk around that side of the business, similar to what we saw with MoPath where you see new test codes come online and maybe payers are less -- more reluctant to pay for them?","David P. King","I don't think we have a lot of visibility into the -- into Next-Gen codes. So far, our experience with payment for Next-Gen methodology has been fine because again, it's a different methodology for performing testing that already has codes assigned. So it's too early to tell at this time, but I will tell you that we're working very hard to avoid a repeat of the MoPath situation in terms of payer policies and utilization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor of Citi.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. Just a follow-up on your ACA volume comments. I just wanted to see, are you suggesting as the year progressed that you've just continued to see more Medicaid volume coming through? Or are you seeing more health care exchange volume? Or is the answer both?","David P. King","Gary, it's Dave. The Medicaid volume was a much bigger percentage of growth in the earlier quarters than it is now. So that's actually abated over time, and it's very hard to attribute that with any precision. But you could argue that, that was people who were getting coverage for the first time under the ACA and were going to the doctor at the beginning of the year. That has -- the -- Medicaid, make no mistake, managed Medicaid has grown significantly this year, but the percentage of overall growth that it accounts for has declined from the first quarter to the second quarter and declined again from the second to the third. In terms of the exchanges, we don't have a lot of visibility about who are our exchange patients because again, they just come to us with an insurance card, and that insurance card says that they have XYZ insurance. It doesn't say that they are exchange patients. So we are seeing, as Glenn mentioned, strong revenue growth from the managed care payer set and some of that, undoubtedly, is exchange-based and some of it is growth in commercial lines.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Second question, just looking at the gross profit this quarter, which you guys did touch on. But what's interesting to me is, I think as far back as our model goes, I don't think we've ever had gross profit dollars up sequentially from 2Q to 3Q. And so I just wondered if you could -- I mean, obviously, the revenue growth in the quarter was part of that dynamic, but even the sequential gross profit margin decline was much less than we would typically see. So I just wonder, is there anything else from that dynamic worth discussing? And it doesn't look like much of that was really carried into what's left for the fourth quarter in terms of gross margin assumption, so any extra on that?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Just as a general comment to your point, gross profit is growing because of the benefit of the volume that we're getting. We talked earlier about just the price mix, while it's a little bit of a headwind, it's been mitigating. So the additional volume we're getting is helping the gross margin. As we look forward, again, we got kind of given the implied numbers for the fourth quarter, so we actually expect to see a pretty good comparison year-over-year, still having a bit of a headwinds. But when you look sequentially, the fourth quarter normally would be a lower-volume period for us compared to the third, so from a trend, if you will, expect that. But we're pleased at least with the volume there, with the productivity that we're getting. Gross profit, it's going to be holding into that kind of range and that we should start to see now even better leverage on our cost structure as we go forward, especially that now this is on the S&A side as the bad debt now starts to compare favorably from period-to-period.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. Last question, just kind of big picture from an investment perspective and kind of going back to the foundation model that you talked about. But when you look at overall, operating income margins have declined since 2008. We all know the reasons for that. But as we look into '15, Dave, you talked about an expectation that mix would improve. I don't know if that yet means that revenue per rep actually can grow in a material way in '15 or not. But really, it seems like, with volumes having recovered, that the bulk of the margin outlook from here is really predicated on that pricing outlook. So as we look into '15, you've got a new cost-saving program you're going to talk about, you're expecting mix to improve. Now is it fair to have expectations at this point that operating margin actually grows in 2015?","David P. King","Gary, we obviously are in the process of working through our budget, which leads to our guidance in February, so I'm not going to answer the question directly because I think it would be unfair to do so. But what I will say is, when we think about 2015, at least what we're seeing in the trends, we have no major managed care renewals. We have a trend of volume strengthening through 2014. Now again, some of that could be one time because of ACA, but obviously, we're very pleased with the volume, and particularly the organic volume contribution in this quarter. Price has been moderating and no guarantee that, that continues, but we've lapped some of the major pricing events, the doc fix cut sequestration, the major impact of MoPath. So what I would say is, there aren't any obvious reasons as I think about the performance in 2014 why we shouldn't see operating margin improvement in 2015. There's no obvious headwinds that are blowing on our faces at the moment, but -- and we feel good about that. But things could change, and so I'm not going to kind of put a stake in the ground right now and say, \"Yes, you should expect to see operating margins improve.\" That would be our hope based on the continuation of the -- if we see the continuation of these positive trends.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a follow-up question on the growth you're seeing for your managed care business and really how it compares to total. So I think, Dave, you mentioned 10% growth in the managed care business. And if we think about it, it's being about 45% of the revenues, is it fair to assume that it contributed about 4.5% to top line growth, and then maybe the rest of your payers and businesses are growing more in line with the market at the 1.5-ish percent to 2% revenue growth? I mean, is that a fair way to look at it?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Ricky, this is Glenn. Overall, again, we did comment that managed care was the strongest growth of the payer groups that we have, but it is a little bit of a mix. So some of that growth is coming out of other areas as opposed to just natural growth, such as patient, if you will, and third party that may have moved into that. But overall, when we look at, from a test perspective, we saw a pretty broad growth really across both the core and the esoteric parts of our business. But from a shift, to your point, managed care is coming in at roughly around 45% of the business that we have. So from a mix standpoint, it increased greater than our other payer categories. But again, with the exception, I guess, of client, that would have been up a fair amount as well. Others would have come down and moved into those categories.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So just as a follow-up, just to tie it to the margin discussion, because I think this is one of the areas that are a little bit confusing to us. Should we assume that given the moving parts in that managed care bucket with ACA lives, et cetera, that maybe for the time being that managed care payer segment might be lower margin than some of the other payers, and that's why you haven't seen the leverage in the margins yet?","David P. King","Ricky, it's Dave. Again, managed care is a very large -- we have over 2,000, 2,500 managed care relationships and contracts, so it's not accurate to paint managed care as having a particular margin. We don't have margins within our business. As I think we've said on a number of occasions, when a specimen goes through the instrument, the instrument doesn't care if it's a Medicare specimen, a Medicaid specimen or a managed care specimen. We don't have margins by payer. What I would say is, the growth in managed care, particularly what you saw in the first quarter, and to some extent, in the second quarter of the year, was overweighted toward movement of patients who previously were uninsured into managed Medicaid. So that, just from a pure price perspective, accounted for a lot of the drag that you saw. And you saw that starting to abate in the third quarter.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just also just lastly, I noted in the past you talked about, on average, 2% to 3% top line growth is kind of a base growth. And once you've kind of get past it, you can start seeing the leverage in the margin. Again, not assuming the moving parts around Medicaid population, does that still hold?","David P. King","Yes, as long as price is flat to up, that still holds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Clair of Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So first one from me, I'm just curious if maybe you can give us your thoughts on FDA regulation of LDTs and how that might impact your business.","David P. King","David, it's Dave. My perspective on FDA regulation of LDTs is quite clear and I've been pretty vocal about it. Diagnostic testing is not a device, it's a medical service. LDTs, the FDA, in our view, does not have the authority to regulate LDTs as medical devices. They don't have the statutory authority to do that because medical tests are not devices. On top of that, the attempt to make this kind of regulatory change through a guidance document, which on its face says that it's not binding on the FDA and only reflects their current views and yet, in this document, lays out a 10-year regulatory plan with registration requirements and penalties for those who don't register, to me, is just incomprehensible. So my perspective is, this is one of the biggest land grab attempts in the history of regulation. And from my perspective, we intend to vigorously oppose it. What could it do to our business? I mean, first of all, it could dramatically affect the practice of medicine, and it is the practice of medicine when doctors select what test to use. And I don't understand how FDA thinks that somehow, creating this great regulatory system around laboratory developed tests is going to help doctors practice medicine. It interferes with the practice of medicine where doctors make rational choices about the tests that they want to use. Furthermore, there's been no study of the economic impact on our industry, on patients or on the practice of medicine related to this because FDA has not followed the proper administrative procedure for doing what it's trying to do. So I think you can tell that I feel very, very strongly about this, and my perspective is that we, as an industry, need to oppose this attempt at regulation as strongly as we possibly can.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then I was hoping to get an update on the noninvasive prenatal testing business. And do you think that right now, we're primarily -- you're seeing primarily high-risk volume? Or do you think we're starting to see some average risk volume there?","David P. King","Well, my understanding is that the test is approved and being offered for high-risk patients. Now there's no question that -- again, let's go back to the last question you asked, which was LDTs and the practice of medicine. Some physicians in the course of the practice of medicine are choosing noninvasive prenatal screening for average-risk patients. That's the physician's choice. We are certainly not marketing the test or presenting the test that way. I will say that most of the payers have policies against payment for noninvasive prenatal testing for average risk. And I think to get a payment -- to get payment in place, the test is going to just need more data to support its use in the average risk population.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about utilization in the context of fourth quarter. I think we've seen a relatively steady uptick in seasonality into fourth quarter of the last few years, and was wondering if your guidance assumes that we'll see another sort of seasonal uptick versus past years.","David P. King","Isaac, it's Dave. The guidance assumes that the fourth quarter will be much like prior fourth quarters in the sense that major contributors to our performance are holidays, weather, limited -- a fewer number of revenue days because of Thanksgiving and obviously the Christmas and New Year's season. So what we do is, obviously, we build the guidance off the full year model and we look at prior fourth quarter experience and incorporate that in, and I can't say that it does or does not include seasonal upticks in volume or seasonal downticks in volume. It's just the guidance, as we always say, encompasses a wide range of outcomes and it's built on a model based on past experience.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just secondly, a question on bad debt. I think earlier in your comments, you said that you thought that the bad debt dynamic has peaked here. I was hoping you could help us understand the reasoning for that process.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yes, Isaac, this is Glenn. Again, it's just a very proactive approach to doing it. Bad debt, just given the volumes we have, will go up. But what we've seen is that from a rate standpoint, based upon historical performance, we saw our rate rise. We now have seen a trend for -- this current quarter is now down from the prior quarter around 20 basis points. If we maintain that level currently, which is at least our expectation now, that it will start to comp favorably to the rate that we would have the same period a year ago. We continue to be very proactive. Part of our business process improvement initiative as well, encompasses how we go about our efforts to collect, and we're encouraged about the initial progress that we're seeing and we would expect that to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So Glenn, one quick question, and I apologize if I missed this. Did you give the actual contribution from nonorganic revenue in the quarter?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","We did not. We gave that, kind of from a volume standpoint, we were up around 6.9%, with most of that coming from organic. You're looking at a little over, call it, 5.5%, give or take, would come from organic and, call it, 1 point, 1.5 points coming from acquisitions.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's quite helpful. And then, Dave, a question for you and going back to a topic I know has been one you're focused on from a government perspective. Now that we're a little bit ways past the doc fix and the clinical lab fee schedule review push out, how do you start to think about the positioning ahead of the review that's going to go into place for 2017 adjustments? How are you guys positioning yourselves with CMS and going about again, proving your point as to the value you provide relative to the review that's going to come up in the market-based pricing that will be put in place. I just want to get a sense now that -- we're 6 months past now, so maybe you have a differentiated view versus where you've been before.","David P. King","Sure. So we've actually -- quite recently, the ACLA membership went and met over at CMS, with folks who were working on the -- how the market survey is going to be formulated and how they're going to evaluate market pricing. And I think the good news coming away from that discussion is that, first of all, CMS recognizes it's a complex task that they've been assigned. And I think, second of all, they generally want to do a good job because I think the understanding of the -- of all the parties was -- that what was intended was, yes, market-based pricing, but it had to be based on true market. It's not just independent lab market. It's not just select market pricing or select test pricing. It's the true market, and the true market has to include commercial payer pricing to hospital laboratories that are paid on an average basis or paid off a commercial lab fee schedule. So obviously, there's a lot of work to be done here. And there will be -- my understanding is there'll be a proposed rule on how the surveys will be conducted that\u2019s going to be coming out from CMS later this year. We are working collaboratively with them as an industry to try to make this a fair process and to get the outcome that the Senate Finance Committee and the government and we agreed, which was the right outcome, which is a market-based pricing benchmark, but again representative of the true market for laboratory services, including all competitors in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice of UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Real quick, I guess. So if we took your 6% organic growth -- 6% revenue growth this quarter and you maintain your full year guidance at 3%, I think that implies that your fourth quarter year-to-year growth steps back down to 3%. I know -- I understand about the -- that every year, the fourth quarter has some seasonal issues in it, but I guess, is there any reason to think that the pace of year-to-year growth that you've seen in the third quarter would moderate in the fourth quarter?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","A.J., this is Glenn, and then ask Dave if he wants to share in the color. You're right, our expectation for the fourth year-over-year is, call it, the 3.3% based on the implied guidance. So that would take the seasonality out, if you will, from a year-over-year. So clearly, it's a reason why sequentially, our fourth quarter estimate is down from the third quarter for the reasons that Dave alluded to earlier. Again, we still feel that there's good, strong organic growth that's in that. We're still seeing some negative implications from price mix that will affect it, but it's becoming less and less. So, the good news is that while the growth on the volume is now at that 3 plus or minus percent growth, we're starting to now get leverage even off of that level. So that we'll continue to see comparability in our margins and earnings, if you will, year-over-year, at that 3% level of revenue growth and hopefully even -- we'll see even better leverage than that.","David P. King","And -- it's Dave. Just -- the only other comment I'd make is back to an earlier observation about we did see a relative spike in the fourth quarter of last year, so again, it's the year-over-year comp that you're looking at, we think about the sequential comp as being reasonably consistent in terms of the growth rate.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe if I could just ask you, I think you mentioned the Alberta contract, and I think we know how much of volumes that is. But is there any commentary about how much revenues and when would that roll off if you're not successful on your appeals?","David P. King","So just to be clear, A.J., we don't consolidate the revenue, so it does not have any revenue impact. It only has an impact below the line, and it's quite immaterial.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","A.J., the contract that we currently have, I believe, takes us through 2016. And as Dave said, given that we're a minority investor in it, we don't consolidate it, so revenues don't show and the earnings, obviously, we take below the line, which again, we don't want to give up, but it's not material.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over back to Mr. Dave King for closing remarks.

Now, eight months after closing, I would like to tell you where we stand with these initiatives.","First, we continue to feature the utility of our patient database as a competitive differentiator. We have been awarded four major pieces of business by adding LabCorp data to Covance proposals, and these wins have contributed nearly $100 million in new orders to our backlog. In tracking this figure, we include only awards in which the sponsor specifically identified LabCorp\u2019 data as influencing the selection of its CRO partner. We continue to receive multiple requests for our patient data from large and emerging pharma customers seeking insights into clinical and commercial questions across multiple therapeutic areas. Sponsor awareness of our unique capability is increasing and we are well on our way to achieving $150 million in incremental revenue by 2018.","Second, we continue to advance our industry leadership in the development and commercialization of companion diagnostics. Last month, we again demonstrated that leadership in both development and commercialization as we announced the launch of two innovative diagnostic assays linked to novel immuno-oncology drugs. Our central laboratory was the exclusive provider of testing in registration trials that supported the regulatory approval of these tests. We have been involved in the development and launch of approximately 70% of all companion diagnostics since inception in 1998, and we are actively working on a sizeable number of ongoing companion diagnostic programs in this increasingly important category of biopharma research and development. New orders have remained strong since the acquisition with programs expanding beyond oncology, and I am confident in our ability to generate $100 million in incremental revenue in this area by 2018.","Third, in addition to our unique combination of high-end laboratory testing and global drug development capabilities, we possess enormous assets around diagnostic information. This includes our direct connection to patients, over 15 billion test results, demographic information, an extensive database of investigators and trial sites, and the largest cohort of genetic counselors in the industry. Supported by our technology-enabled solutions, we are ideally positioned to create large databases, facilitate patient access to trials, gather real-world evidence of disease state prevalence and market size, provide interpretation of diagnostic results, and combine patient, site and disease state information into innovative new value creators. Customer response to these real-world evidence capabilities has been strongly positive, and we look forward to generating at least $50 million of new revenue in this category by 2018. ","Fourth, Covance\u2019s central lab business has expanded and further differentiated its capabilities through the addition of LabCorp\u2019 genomic, genetic and anatomic pathology testing. Because of our unrivaled combination of test menu, quality, clinical and scientific expertise, we continue to strengthen our market-leading position and deliver strong results. In short, the strategic theses of our combination are rapidly translating to financial success, and the proof of the growth opportunity for our combined company is increasingly compelling. ","While I am speaking about innovation, I will provide an update on BeaconLBS. BeaconLBS continues to perform well, contributing $18 million or 1.2% to our organic revenue growth in the quarter, although in this pilot phase it remains a drag on overall margin. In addition, the BeaconLBS team\u2019s goal of delivering the right test to the right patient at the right time through the highest quality laboratory network is rapidly being realized. In barely six months of full implementation, utilization trend in the pilot market has improved and adherence to testing guidelines has increased. Out-of-network lab spend has declined, leading to a decline in overall lab spend for our partner. We are optimistic that this solid evidence of achievement will continue and will expand the BeaconLBS opportunity.","To close, I would like to thank all of our people around their globe. Their dedication to our strategic priorities during this period of exciting transformation is one of the company\u2019s combined greatest strengths. Their commitment to delivering world-class diagnostic information, bringing innovative new drugs to market faster and using information to change the way care is delivered is inspiring, and it is gratifying to see this commitment translate to concrete results on so many fronts. As the world\u2019s largest laboratory and leading healthcare diagnostics company, we are excited about and well positioned for the future.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. I\u2019m going to start my comments with a review of our consolidated third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments, and then conclude with an update on our 2015 guidance. ","Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 46% over last year. The acquisition of Covance contributed $647 million during the quarter, driving 42% year-over-year revenue growth. The other 5% was driven by solid organic volume growth across both core and esoteric testing, as well as benefits from BeaconLBS, price mix, and tuck-in acquisitions that were partially offset by currency.","Gross profit for the quarter $763 million or 33.6% of revenue compared to $571 million or 36.8% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to the acquisition of Covance as well as organic volume, price mix and productivity partially offset by personnel costs. Personnel costs were up due to annual merit increases and normal headcount additions in support of our top line growth. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to the mix impact of Covance. Excluding Covance, gross margin would have been 36.7%, a decrease of 10 basis points versus last year.","SG&A for the quarter was $383 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $306 million or 19.7% last year. Excluding special charges of $5 million related to the acquisition of Covance, SG&A in the quarter was $377 million or 16.6% of revenue, a 270 basis point reduction versus last year\u2019s adjusted SG&A. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to Covance and personnel costs partially offset by Project LaunchPad savings. The favorable reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue benefited from Covance\u2019s lower SG&A rate and the reduction in our bad debt rate. Excluding Covance and special charges, SG&A as a percentage of revenue would have been 18.7%, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year. ","During the quarter, we recorded $32 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily relating to severance and facility-related costs. Amortization expense for the quarter was $47 million, up from $18 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions. ","Operating income for the quarter was $307 million or 13.5% of revenue compared to $241 million or 15.6% last year. Excluding amortization and restructuring of special items of $79 million, adjusted operating income was $386 million or 17% of revenue compared to $271 million or 17.5% last year. Excluding the mix impact from Covance, adjusted operating margin would have been 18%, an increase of 50 basis points over last year. ","Interest expense for the quarter was $56 million compared to $26 million last year. The increase was due to higher debt balances following the acquisition of Covance. The tax rate for the quarter was 38.9%, higher than last year\u2019s 37.2% rate due to the taxable nature of certain restructuring charges. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 35.5%, in line with our expectations.","As a result, net earnings for the quarter were $153 million or $1.49 per diluted share compared to $137 million or $1.59 per share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS was $2.07 in the quarter, up 15% from $1.80 last year.","During the quarter, operating cash flow was $288 million compared to $176 million last year, with the increase due to the acquisition of Covance as well as improved earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $68 million, up from $53 million last year due to Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $220 million compared to $123 million last year.","At quarter-end, our cash balance was $713 million compared to $619 million at the end of the second quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.7 billion and our liquidity was approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of cash and available credit. During the quarter, we invested $8 million in acquisitions and paid down $125 million of debt, reducing the company\u2019s leverage to 3.4 times net debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA. ","Now I\u2019ll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are presented on a pro forma basis for all periods as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2014, and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today\u2019s press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.","Now I\u2019ll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 4.8% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, BeaconLBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. The increase in revenue of 4.8% includes the benefit from Beacon LBS of 1.2% and an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 1%. Total volume increased by 2.9%, of which organic volume was 2.3% and acquisition volume was 0.6%. Revenue per requisition increased by 1.7%, benefiting from price and mix as well as tuck-in acquisitions that have an overall revenue per requisition higher than the segment average. ","LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $330 million or 20.6% of revenue compared to $306 million or 20% last year. The increase was primarily due to volume, price mix and productivity partially offset by personnel costs and currency. Improvement in productivity was driven by Project LaunchPad, which delivered approximately $20 million of net savings during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $45 million. We remain on track to achieve our goal of $150 million in savings over the three-year period ending 2017.","Now I\u2019ll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $669 million, an increase of 2.6% over last year. The stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 370 basis points. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 6.3% over last year led by strong volume in the central lab and early development businesses, while the growth rate in the clinical business improved sequentially from the second quarter. ","Adjusted operating income was $97 million or 14.5% of revenue compared to $88 million or 13.6% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to volume and cost synergies partially offset by personnel costs and mix. Personnel costs increased in part due to added headcount in the clinical business in advance of the initiation of awarded projects. We captured approximately $15 million of cost synergies during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $30 million. We remain on track to achieve our goal of $100 million in savings over the three-year period ending 2017. Net orders during the quarter were $811 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.21, while backlog at quarter end was $6.7 billion. ","Now I\u2019ll update our 2015 guidance. We expect revenue growth of approximately 41% inclusive of Covance as of February 19 after the impact of approximately 220 basis points of negative currency. We have assumed that foreign exchange rates stay at September 30, 2015 levels for the remainder of the year. We expect LabCorp Diagnostics to grow 4.5 to 5.5% in 2015 after the impact of approximately 90 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 3.5 to 5.5% primarily due to continued strong organic growth. Covance Drug Development\u2019s net revenue is expected to be in the range of minus-0.5% to plus-0.5% versus full-year 2014 after the impact of approximately 350 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of minus-1.5% to plus-0.5%. ","We expect 2015 adjusted EPS of $7.80 to $7.95 as we\u2019ve narrowed the range from our prior guidance of $7.75 to $8. We expect operating cash flow in 2015 to be $970 million to $995 million versus our prior guidance of $990 million to $1.015 billion, and capital expenditures to be $250 million to $275 million versus prior guidance of $270 million to $295 million. As a result, free cash flow remains unchanged from our prior guidance of $695 million to $745 million. Excluding net non-recurring acquisition items of approximately $120 million, we expect free cash flow of $815 million to $865 million, unchanged from our prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks and we\u2019ll now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig Hallum. Your line is open.","Bill Bonello","Good morning guys. On the lab side of the business, just want to probe a bit more about the movements that we saw in volume and price growth. Can you perhaps give us some sense of how much those growth rates were affected? You talked about some new business wins that were going to annualize during the quarter and maybe how much that impacted the volume growth, and if it had a corresponding impact on the price, and then maybe just any thoughts about where you would think of volume and price maybe shaking out as we look forward from here.","James Boyle","Hey Bill, this is Jay Boyle. How are you? ","Bill Bonello","Great.","James Boyle","I want to touch on the volume, and Glenn will take the price. As you noted, in some of our prior calls we have indicated that we expected to see a little bit of a downward trend on our year-over-year organic growth beat, and that is exactly what\u2019s happened as we\u2019ve annualized the two contracts that you mentioned. However, we are seeing sequential volume growth quarter to quarter, and we\u2019re very pleased with the 2.3% organic volume, the 2.9% overall. So that\u2019s consistent with what we thought would happen, and again, we\u2019re pleased with the result.","Glenn, you want to talk about the price?","Glenn Eisenberg","Sure. Good morning, Bill. Overall, needless to say, we feel we had a good quarter from both of our businesses, but in the diagnostics business in particular, the strong growth in organic revenue and volume that Jay commented, as well as obviously our price per requisitions improving nicely as well through the combination of the acquisitions, the tuck-in acquisitions that we\u2019ve done at higher price points, as well as favorable test mix overall. But we continue to leverage well in the business, and you see that reflected in the improvement in our operating margins.","Bill Bonello","So would it be safe to say that on the volume side, most of the sequential change in the growth rate is attributable to those business wins annualizing?","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. ","Bill Bonello","Okay, and what about on the price side? Would the same thing be true there, the increase attributable to that annualizing, or were other things driving that?","David King","Bill, it\u2019s Dave. No, the price impact of the annualization was not material to the overall price. There were, as we mentioned, three components to the price growth, which was largely driven by mix and then the acquisitions that we completed that were at an average revenue per requisition that was above the overall segment average.","Bill Bonello","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny","Good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.","David King","Thank you, good morning.","Michael Cherny","So first just on the Covance Drug Development side, really nice sequential improvement. You talked about, from what I can see at least, improvements in all three key segments. Is there any unifying factor that drove the improvements, or maybe if you can give a little more color within early development versus clinical and central lab, kind of what you saw as the key components particularly in areas like central lab, where I know you had some issues earlier in the year with more kit mix and stuff that was out of your control versus actual health of the business.","Deborah Keller","Good morning, this is Deborah Keller. So yes, you\u2019re right - all three of our service lines had constant dollar sequential growth this quarter, and I would say it was led by central lab, which as you said was roughly flat in the first half of the year. They had a substantial increase in their kit volume which is driving a much strong growth rate in Q3. Early development also is strong, and they had those nice incremental drop-through as well. ","So in our central lab, back to that, we had record level kits both in and out, and we had an increase in our testing volume as well. As far as clinical, we had good sequential increased growth rate and strong orders for the quarter.","Michael Cherny","Great, thanks Deb. Then Dave, just one question for you. Since the last call, there\u2019s been a lot of moving pieces in terms of the true value, I think, of the lab. Obviously you had the PAMA decision that occurred a few weeks back. You\u2019ve had a lot of noise around your private upstart competitor and what the actual value proposition they provide is. Maybe can you use this opportunity now, given especially following these results, to kind of reestablish what makes LabCorp differentiated versus the rest of the market in terms of delivering service to the end customer?","David King","Sure, good morning, Michael. You know, first of all, I\u2019ll just come back to something we\u2019ve been saying for a long time, which is there is no healthcare system without laboratory medicine. We are about 3% of the overall spend. We drive 70 to 80% of the healthcare decisions. For those who have ever been to the doctor and not felt well, or have taken a child to the doctor who is not feeling well, the first question is, what do the labs say? So we feel very confident that even in a time of enormous change, the lab is always going to be absolutely central to healthcare and to the delivery of healthcare, and to patient care. ","Running a laboratory business well requires size, scale, scientific and medical capability and credibility, and true innovation. LabCorp has all of those things. We have an enormous infrastructure. We have enormous IT capabilities. We have a dedicated and highly motivated workforce that the number one thing they think about every day is serving the patient. We have clinicians and scientists who have been at this company for 10, 20, 30, 40 years. We have invented laboratory tests that now are standard of care in the market, and I challenge anybody else to stand up to those capabilities.","Then on top of it, we are the most efficient, lowest cost, highest quality provider, and add in at the back end, Michael, that we have consistently led in innovation, whether it\u2019s 70% of the companion diagnostics, whether it\u2019s always having the newest test, whether it\u2019s BeaconLBS. We have consistently been the market leaders in innovation and we will continue to be the market leaders in innovation. So this is a great business. We\u2019ve been wise stewards of capital for our shareholders, and we look forward to great, great opportunity in the diagnostics business in years to come.","Michael Cherny","Thanks Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill","Great, thanks very much. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to follow up with just a couple quick questions around the Covance side. Either Dave or Deborah, can you maybe talk about two things: one, Dave, you\u2019re talking about these incremental opportunities that you talked about on the revenue synergy side, but how do we think about the trajectory going into next year? I know it might be a little early to give specific guidance, but is it reasonable to think that this is kind of a mid-single digit grow, or how do I think about this business over the next 12 months?","David King","Morning Lisa, it\u2019s Dave. You know, I think it is early to give guidance for next year, although I applaud you for trying. I think what I would say is if you look at the historical growth rates in this business in constant currency, it\u2019s mid to high single digits, and the central lab has years of very strong growth and years of less strong growth. We said earlier this year when central lab got off to a slow start, that we expected it to rebound in the second half, and here we are with a very strong rebound at central lab. Early development, the incremental margin on the business is terrific, and we\u2019re being very careful about capacity and pricing in that business. I was really pleased to see the sequential improvement in clinical revenues.","Again, we\u2019re not giving guidance, but the historical growth rate has been mid to high single digits, and that should be a good frame of reference at least to think about how the business ought to be able to perform in the out years.","Lisa Gill","That\u2019s helpful. And then Dave, you talked about each of the three components of the revenue synergies that you had laid out when you did the transaction. You talked about patient data and winning, but how about on each of the others? Is there anything, or revenue numbers you can put around that today for companion diagnostics or diagnostic information? You said you had $15 billion of tests, et cetera, but is there any way to give us a frame as to where you are on those two components?","David King","Well, I think in my preliminary comments, I mentioned that we feel like we\u2019ve made very good progress, and obviously that will be incorporated in the guidance as we give it, and it will be incorporated into the overall top line growth. So I would think about those things as being--they have the potential to be incremental contributors, and the question is obviously translating them from orders into revenue, and that will be part of what we incorporate into the guidance for next year and the years ahead.","Lisa Gill","Okay, very helpful, and congratulations on a nice quarter.","David King","Thank you, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start with PAMA, and just curious whether you had some initial thoughts from the proposed rule that came out a few weeks ago, and then as you go through the comment period today, just where are the areas that you see as opportunity to work with CMS.","David King","Good morning, Jack, it\u2019s Dave. So this is going to take a couple minutes, but I want to give you a comprehensive answer about PAMA. So let\u2019s step back to why PAMA was enacted.","There was an OIG report that suggested that Medicare pricing was not market competitive with commercial pricing, and Congress enacted a statute specifically around the idea of let\u2019s fine out--let\u2019s base Medicare on a market-based price, and let\u2019s find out whether Medicare is market-based and if it\u2019s not, let\u2019s adjust it. So that was the purpose of the statute, and it was clear in the legislative history, it was clear from the floor colloquy between Senator Burr and Hatch, it was clear in the letter that they believe that hospitals were an important part of the market to consider.","Now when PAMA came out, obviously hospitals were not included, and that was extremely disappointing. I would point out in the first place, there was a statutory misconstruction in the regulation because what Congress said was if over 50% of the hospital lab revenue came from the clinical lab fee schedule, that it should be included. What CMS put out was if over 50% of the Medicare revenue came from the CLFS, it should be included. Well, as I\u2019ve already pointed out in response to an earlier question and as everybody knows, lab is about 3% of the total Medicare spend, so it is structurally impossible for lab to be more than 50% of the total Medicare revenue.","The CMS also lumped the lab in with the entire hospital system in doing the calculation, which again negated any possibility that the hospitals could be included. They did that not by using the tax side [indiscernible] and the NPI, so from our perspective, CMS\u2019 proposed regulation did not faithfully attempt to do what Congress had asked it to do.","Now let me talk specifically about the decision not to include hospitals and why we think that is erroneous. The week after CMS came out with the explanation of why hospitals were not included, the Office of Inspector General released its data brief for 2014. Medicare paid $7 billion in Part B hospital lab tests - I\u2019m quoting directly from the data brief. Hospitals received $1.7 billion or 24% of Medicare Part B payments through the clinical lab fee schedule. So let\u2019s stop right there - hospitals that CMS said are not part of the relevant market received 24% of Medicare Part B clinical lab fee schedule payments. Physician labs received $1.3 billion or 19%, but CMS decided they are part of the market. ","Hospitals received 25% of the payments for the top 25 tests, which accounted for $4.2 billion of the spend, so they received an even higher percentage of the top 25 tests, and again CMS decided they were not part of the market. Furthermore, CMS cut the outpatient perspective, the OPPS, the hospital outpatient perspective payment system by 2% for 2016, and specifically stated in making that cut that it was because $1 billion of lab testing that they thought were going to go through the OPPS in fact went through the clinical lab fee schedule in 2014. CMS also stated they were reducing the OPPS not to recoup the prior overpayment but to eliminate the future overpayment, implying they expect that $1 billion to continue to go through the clinical lab fee schedule. So this is obviously a concession by CMS that significant hospital lab payments will continue to go through the clinical lab fee schedule, and it squares with what the OIG said. ","Now go back to what is the market, and it\u2019s difficult for me to understand how CMS comes to the conclusion that entities that are receiving 24, 25% of the payments are not part of the market. I also just took a quick opportunity last night, because again it\u2019s what is the market, to look at the Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina website - this is publicly available data that anybody can see. A lipid panel, one of the top 25 tests, Quest and LabCorp price approximately $8 to $10, REX hospital $79, University of North Carolina $93, Duke $102. The assay of thyroid stimulating hormone - TSH, one of the top 25 tests, Quest and LabCorp $12, REX Hospital $66, University of North Carolina $86, Duke $98. That is the competitive market, and that is what Congress asked CMS to look at to determine if Medicare pricing was market-based. Again, it\u2019s difficult to understand how CMS concluded that that data is all irrelevant.","Finally, I would just point out that the timing that has been imposed here is quite unrealistic. We\u2019re supposed to start submitting data before the final rule is even completed, and CMS is apparently going to analyze that data and put out results in 2017 based on a six-month period, even though they stated in the regulation that the year period is what would be preferable.","So obviously, it\u2019s a preliminary rule. I think you can tell from my commentary, we have a lot of comments as to the rule that CMS has promulgated, but that\u2019s our perspective on the PAMA regulation. ","Jack Meehan","Yes, thanks Dave. That was very well said. Maybe just one follow-up for Glenn on the lab business, give you a little break. The pricing growth that came through, I know some of that was related to the genomic and esoteric volumes coming through. I was surprised some of that better growth didn\u2019t fall through on the gross margin line, so could you--and I know you talked about it being 10 BPs higher year-over-year. Just any other granularity around that would be great.","Glenn Eisenberg","Sure, Jack. Overall, as you said, the gross margin excluding the impact of Covance would have been down around 10 basis points. Included in that, you heard earlier the pilot program that we have at Beacon, which Dave commented while it\u2019s a contributor to the revenue that we wouldn\u2019t have had a year ago, in its pilot stage is not contributing to profitability, so that had a, call it a headwind on gross margin, so were it not for that, our gross margin was favorable. Again, most of the pricing, if you will, we\u2019ve talked about was from the benefit of the acquisition mix up, as well as just overall, call it test mix. But overall, we feel we\u2019ve leveraged well. We\u2019ve leveraged the diagnostic segment in excess of 30% on the incremental revenues and saw 60 basis point improvement in our operating margin, so overall we\u2019re getting the benefit of that additional volume as well as our continued productivity improvement and initiative through LaunchPad.","Jack Meehan","That makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Your line is open. Robert, if you line is on mute, could you please un-mute it?","Robert Willoughby","Yes, I\u2019m sorry. Dave, can you give us anything you can on the food safety business? You obviously did a deal there, but how are you sizing that market, the growth opportunity to margin profile, and where could that business be three to five years down the line for you? And maybe also just the synergy with the base business, if anecdotally you could point us to areas where you have a real advantage growing that business?","David King","Sure, good morning, Bob. So when we made the acquisition, we identified nutritional chemistry and food safety as a growth opportunity because it is a significantly growing market and it\u2019s a global market. Obviously with the increase in food importation, with the increase also in the number of detected concerns about food safety, we saw this as a nice opportunity for growth. ","So when we looked at the business, the market size is substantial. Obviously it\u2019s not the size of the total lab industry, but the market size is substantial - it\u2019s in the billions of dollars of global opportunity. We look at the margin profile as being attractive, and we look at the opportunity around what LabCorp and Covance bring together as there are two aspects of the food safety business. One is the chemistry side, and the other is the microbiology side. Covance has always had great expertise on the chemistry side; LabCorp obviously from our core lab testing brings a significant amount of expertise on the microbiological capabilities and also on the infrastructure, so it\u2019s very important to be close to the customers because the food is sitting, waiting to be shipped. So the combination of infrastructure, microbiology and chemistry really positions us, we think, to take a market leadership position.","On the nutritional side, the analysis of ingredients and purity, again all of the controversy around organic food, genetically modified food, what is safe food - this is another nice opportunity for us to grow the business, and again it\u2019s a global opportunity. We actually have a food safety lab in Singapore as well as our large lab in Madison, and we\u2019re very, very excited about adding International Food Network and the National Food Laboratory to these capabilities. ","Robert Willoughby","Can you size your opportunity maybe three to five years out, and what kind of spend you need to get there? Is it an expensive build?","David King","We have aspirations. I\u2019m not prepared to talk about them specifically, but we have aspirations that this business will be in the nine figures in revenue - hopefully the mid-nine figures, but these are just aspirational ideas for our company. There will be some which we\u2019ll do through acquisitions, as we demonstrated we\u2019re ready to do with the Safe Foods transaction, and there will be some that we\u2019ll do by organic growth. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something where we think about there will be an enormous amount of investment to get there.","Robert Willoughby","Interesting, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. As a reminder, in the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and return to the queue for any additional questions. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro","Thanks guys. Let me try one question with two parts. On the capex side, you guys tracked a little better than your guidance. Could you talk a little bit about handicapping the potential for capex to kind of run rate from here? Is there a little bit more potential for that number to come down? And then secondly, any updated thoughts on potential for, or how you\u2019re thinking about cash returns, specifically the potential for a dividend? Thank you.","Glenn Eisenberg","Hey Isaac, this is Glenn Eisenberg. On the capex side, as you know, we\u2019re not a very capital intensive company overall, and we continue to manage fairly tightly. We did bring down our guidance for the year based upon the current trend of capital spending that we have, and obviously the level of spending is a function of just projects and opportunities that we see, including our LaunchPad initiative where we are going through some structural investments. But overall, we\u2019ve been tracking around, call it $70 million per quarter, and you might see that go up a little bit in the fourth quarter but still tracking at, call it around our depreciation level.","As far as the cash returns, as you know, historically we\u2019ve been a strong supporter of bringing excess cash back to shareholders in the form of share repurchases as opposed to dividends, and obviously given the acquisition of Covance and our higher leverage, we\u2019re focused now on using some of that cash flow to pay down debt. But as the board convenes effectively every quarter, we do talk about our capital allocation, our return of capital back to shareholders. Dividends is part of the discussion, as is share repurchases, and we\u2019ll continue to have those discussions and let you know each quarter what we do with our capital.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thanks a bunch.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Nicholas Jansen","Hey guys, nice job. I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on the volume in the quarter. You\u2019ve seen from the hospital companies, your largest competitor, talk a little bit about some level of market softness, maybe in the first half of the quarter. I just wanted to kind of get your views on the overall market trend and maybe why you\u2019re continuing to capture market share relative to your peer group. Thank you. ","David King","It\u2019s Dave. I\u2019ll start and then if Jay has anything to add, I know we\u2019ll welcome that. You know, I think Jay gave a very precise explanation of why you saw the organic volume decline year-over-year. We had specifically called that out and identified it. We had nice sequential volume growth, and I attribute it to we have a great leadership team, we have a great team of people on the ground, and they are executing well. We\u2019re seeing nice growth in the core business, we\u2019re seeing nice growth in the esoteric business. We\u2019re bringing new tests to market, so the only commentary we can give is I think the numbers speak for themselves. The numbers show that we\u2019re performing very well and that volume continues to grow.","Nicholas Jansen","Great. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open.","Amanda Murphy","Hi, good morning guys. I just had a quick follow-up question to what Lisa asked earlier. So again, recognizing you\u2019re not giving guidance at this point, can you just put your comments in context around that high single digit, mid to high single digit growth framework for Covance in context with the Sanofi situation, because I think that a 2 to 3% headwind for you guys next year. So do you still think you can do that mid to high single digit growth on the back of that Sanofi contract situation?","David King","Amanda, it\u2019s Dave. You know, again, we\u2019re not guiding, and so when we come out with the guidance, we will have all the puts and takes incorporated. Again, what we said is that the historic growth rate is mid to high single digits, and Sanofi will be incorporated into whatever guidance we give. There will be other puts and takes in the businesses as well, so I don\u2019t think we should single out any one thing and try to extrapolate what that\u2019s going to mean to the overall guidance. We\u2019ll give the guidance in February when we give the guidance, and we look forward to being--to over time seeing Covance achieve the growth rates that the industry historically has turned in.","Glenn Eisenberg","Amanda, maybe I\u2019ll just add one thing, just relative to this year - and again, won\u2019t comment or we can annualize for next year. But if you just wanted to isolate on Sanofi, you\u2019ll obviously be able to get into our implied guidance in the fourth quarter for Covance overall, which is continued good year-over-year growth in the business. That will be impacted by Sanofi as that contract expired at the end of October, as you know having around, call it a $12 million impact in the fourth quarter, so that will impact the growth rate, if you will, by 1.8%. But obviously, we\u2019ve got a lot of other business that\u2019s coming in to replace that, but our guidance, if you will, for the rest of this year is inclusive with not having that contract for the last two months of the year.","Amanda Murphy","Got it, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Zach Sopcak","Hey, good morning. This is Zach Sopcak for Ricky. I wanted to go back to test mix for a second and just ask, you used to have a goal - I think it was 45% esoteric testing. Can you give an update on where you are relative to that, and if the better mix was driven by any tests in particular, like BRCA or something else that\u2019s longer term sustainable?","Glenn Eisenberg","Zach, this is Glenn. I\u2019ll give you the other ones. Clearly growing esoteric is one of the main strategies of the company with the new tests that we\u2019re developing, and it continues to grow and we\u2019re seeing favorable test mix from that area. It hasn\u2019t quite gotten to, call it the 40% of the company. It\u2019s still kind of an aspirational goal, but it\u2019s moving in the right direction.","David King","This is Dave. I would say the major drivers of growth in the esoteric category were continued strong performance in new swab, BRCA, non-invasive prenatal testing. We actually even in the quarter already started to get orders for the companion diagnostics that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, so there was nice progress across the board.","Zach Sopcak","Got it, thanks. And then can I ask you guys on the bad debt improvement? Can you give any color how much of it was driven by Project LaunchPad versus just overall more coverage from the ACA?","Glenn Eisenberg","This is Glenn. We continue to focus a lot from our LaunchPad initiative into cycle management and in particular one of the key aspects is the bad debt. We continue to see the rate coming down. We came in on the diagnostic side probably around 30 basis points year-over-year, so even though our, call it our volume, our revenue is going up, our bad debt expense is going down, so the savings on the rate is even greater because you\u2019re still getting obviously new business. But overall, it\u2019s mostly a function of, again, just the continued hard work of all our people identifying where the issues are and tackling it, and we expect to see that rate continue to improve.","David King","Yes, it\u2019s Dave. I don\u2019t think the ACA had a material impact this year. I think most of the ACA benefit in terms of enrolment has annualized, so as Glenn said, I think it\u2019s LaunchPad, it\u2019s sustained and focused effort by our revenue cycle management team, and it\u2019s just really good, diligent, hard work on the ground to collect the monies that are owed to us.","Zach Sopcak","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks, and good morning everyone. I guess a two-part question. The first is just an update on BeaconLBS - when might we see that move out of the pilot program in Florida? I guess not necessarily assuming it\u2019s going to go national right away, but just kind of curious what the latest thoughts are there. And then secondly, on the $30 million in cost synergies that you guys have dialed in over the past two quarters, it strikes me that the $100 million target by 2017 is a little conservative, so I\u2019d love to hear some color on that as well. Thank you.","David King","Bill, it\u2019s Dave. I can answer the first part of the question quickly, and that is on BeaconLBS, we continue to have discussions about expanding to additional markets and with additional customers. We feel great that the BeaconLBS is proving out exactly as it was designed to, and I compliment the BeaconLBS team on, again, great effort, great execution, great accomplishments, and we\u2019ll look forward to updating you as we enter new markets and agree to new business opportunities with new partners.","Glenn Eisenberg","Bill, this is Glenn. On the Covance cost synergy side, our target still is the $100 million over the three years. It\u2019s going to be weighted a little differently as we go--","David King","One hundred and fifty.","Glenn Eisenberg","This is the Covance--","David King","Oh, I\u2019m sorry - Covance. I thought he was talking about LaunchPad. My apologies.","Glenn Eisenberg","On the $100 million over the three years, it\u2019s going to be a little bit lumpy. We obviously have gotten a lot of benefits early on by taking out the redundant public company costs, leveraging the purchasing power of our two businesses, but it will take some time further to get through the lab consolidation, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s a little bit more back-ended as we have to continue to finish through all the trials that are being done in those facilities. So we\u2019re off to a very strong start. We expect it to continue to improve year-over-year, but we\u2019re looking still at the, call it $100 million over the three years. I\u2019d be remiss, because Dave\u2019s sitting next to me, that we always strive to exceed the targets that we\u2019ve established, but we\u2019ll do that after we first achieve the targets that we\u2019ve established. ","Bill Quirk","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Wanted just to go back to the capex question just for a second. Your original range at the beginning of the year was about 325 to 350, and you dialed it down to 250 to 275 over a couple of quarters. I guess I\u2019m just curious what the biggest difference is between then and now. I understand and can appreciate that some projects can get pushed out and delayed, but just trying to get a sense of what we should see going forward, and whether or not any of these perhaps delayed projects pick up into next year.","Glenn Eisenberg","Whit, this is Glenn. Needless to say, when we put together our plan and our guidance in the early part of the year, it\u2019s with going through a business planning process with the businesses identifying where they feel there are capital investment opportunities in addition to just the normal maintenance and so forth. So we start off with that premise, but as the year unfolds, we continue to look at each of the investments and we look at it relative to others - some new ones will come in, some other ones may get deferred based on timing. But the level of spend that we have, we feel is in line with our averages. We\u2019re actually spending less this year than in prior years if you looked at it on a pro forma basis, which is positive, and we\u2019ve always said we would trend a little bit to that because both companies in fact have made some sizeable investments in systems, facilities and so forth. ","But we\u2019re comfortable with the spend, as you can see by our implied guidance. We expect a higher spend in the fourth quarter than we did over the last couple. Hopefully we\u2019ll be below that, but we continue to evaluate each project as a standalone investment and we make the decision whether or not we\u2019ll go forward. But we see a lot of good opportunities to invest that capital.","David King","Whit, it\u2019s Dave. I would just add parenthetically, we are not under-spending or starving the businesses of capital to reduce the number. We\u2019re being very thoughtful about how we invest the capital, but it\u2019s not that we\u2019re pushing projects out that are going to come back next year. It\u2019s that we\u2019re looking at every single project rigorously and saying, do we need to spend the capital dollars here or are there better places to deploy it?","Whit Mayo","Yeah, no I was--I mean, the free cash flow is just getting to be a pretty big number, so just trying to make sure people appreciate that. I guess my last question is I think you\u2019ve got maybe a $250 million senior note due this year, and just curious if those were gone now and do you plan to be in the market to refinance those, or just take them outright altogether? Just thoughts on that would be great.","Glenn Eisenberg","Sure, Whit. This is Glenn. We have $250 million of bonds that are due in December of this year, and our current intention is to use cash on hand to pay down the debt. ","Whit Mayo","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from AJ Rice with UBS. Your line is open.","AJ Rice","Hi everybody. Just two quick questions. I appreciate the commentary around PAMA and the frustration with the hospitals not being included. I\u2019m just curious - if you take the proposal as is, CMS has put in there an impact analysis of about a 4.5% cut in 2017. Do you have any reaction to that impact as the average cut to the industry would experience, and then is there any commentary on the 2016 proposed rule which has also come out, any opportunities or challenges that creates? ","David King","AJ, it\u2019s Dave. It\u2019s hard to size the 4.5% assessment that CMS gave, obviously because we\u2019re not privy to the data that they used to analyze it; however, it does reinforce something we have been saying all along, which is we don\u2019t see a draconian negative outcome here for the industry. So it does reinforce our sense that this is not the doomsday scenario that many people had painted.","In terms of the rest of the proposed 2016 rule, we are looking at it carefully. Obviously there are some proposed changes around drugs and abuse testing, there are some proposed changes around next-gen sequencing, there are some proposed changes around panels. None of them appear to be material to us at this early stage, but we will continue to analyze them and obviously file comments as appropriate.","AJ Rice","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Gary Lieberman","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Maybe if you talk about commercial pricing a little bit, where you are in your contract negotiations, and then is there any potential for any fallout from the PAMA decision sort of working its way through commercial reimbursement?","David King","Gary, it\u2019s Dave. I\u2019ll let Jay comment on the commercial negotiations. I don\u2019t see the PAMA rule having an impact on commercial pricing, with the exception of one very small area, which is there are some Medicare Advantage plans that are tied to the Medicare fee schedule. As I say, it\u2019s a very, very small part of the business. Other than that, our negotiations with commercial payors are based on value, they are based on individual CPT codes. They are not--obviously the Medicare fee schedule is always a frame of reference, but they are not based on that fee schedule. So I always say, when the Medicare fee schedule goes up, that doesn\u2019t get us an increase with the commercial payors, and when the Medicare fee schedule goes down, that doesn\u2019t get us a decrease.","James Boyle","Gary, the only thing I would add on the commercial pricing is obviously we feel very good about our managed care relationships and our current contract initiatives. There are no major contracts that are coming up through the end of this year. We have great relationships with our managed care partners and we feel great about the opportunity to continue to provide them with the level of service that we have.","Gary Lieberman","Great. Maybe if I could ask a follow-up, Dave, you\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about how the value proposition is so strong for LabCorp. We\u2019re seeing at least some movement towards accountable care models and some bundled payment models. Are you seeing any benefit from that, or do you think we\u2019re on the cusp of starting to see some benefit from that?","David King","I think it\u2019s very early days on the accountable care and the bundles. Obviously, I think right now, from my understanding, most of the bundles are just putting all the payments together and then distributing them out pretty much consistent with the status quo for the bundle. I think over time, this is a great opportunity for us. Again, as the highest quality and most efficient provider, and as the bundles start to include more services without more dollars behind them, reference back to my observation about the commercial pricing for hospital laboratory services earlier. People are going to look for the highest quality, highest value service, and we\u2019re going to be in a position to provide that. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to see volume shifting and share moving in our direction as a result of that change in the marketplace.","Gary Lieberman","Great, thanks a lot.","David King","Excuse me, Operator. It\u2019s right at 10 o\u2019clock. We have four questions in the queue, so we\u2019ll do the lightning round here; but let\u2019s please try not to ask questions that have previously been answered. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Donald Hooker","Great, good morning. So real quick, I guess maybe the pre-clinical sort of toxicology business. I know it\u2019s small, but there\u2019s a lot of leverage there, I think, over time, so can you talk a little bit about some of the trends in pricing and how much capacity you have there over the next couple years? How long can you grow that business before you need to add capacity?","Deborah Keller","Okay, thanks. This is Deb. Globally, we\u2019re at about 70s as far as capacity. Utilization in the U.S. is slightly higher and Europe is a little bit lower. Obviously we\u2019re glad to see our capacity filling. It\u2019s a much improved situation versus a few years ago. We do run a global business and that\u2019s been to our advantage, because it allows us to move studies around to maximize our capacity globally, and that way we can leverage it. We do monitor our capacity obviously daily.","As far as pricing, we\u2019ve seen some low single digit price increases generally speaking. It\u2019s different for different types of studies and in different parts of the world, and again it\u2019s much better than the price decline we\u2019d seen a few years ago. With our global capacity, we do have some flexibility about capacity additions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Francis of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dave Francis","Hey, good morning and congrats on the quarter. Real quick, bigger picture for either Dave or Deb, given some of the political and median noise around drug pricing and marketing that some of your customers are experiencing right now on the drug development side of the business, are you seeing any change in their behavior or your type of discussions with them relative to some of the things that they are dealing with there real time? Thanks.","Deborah Keller","Yes, this is Deb. I\u2019ll start out and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave. You know, as far as from an early development standpoint, our orders continue to be strong from all segments - emerging, midsize and large pharma, so at least thus far we\u2019ve not seen it impacting.","David King","And I\u2019d just quickly add, the drug development business is about innovation, and innovation is going to continue to be the answer to improved delivery of healthcare. So we don\u2019t see any reason why the current controversy should affect the desire over the long term for innovative drugs to market and for Covance being an absolutely essential part of bringing innovative new medicines to patients.","Dave Francis","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian, if your line is on mute, can you please un-mute it? He may have pressed the star, one key in error. We\u2019ll move on to the next question. ","Our next question comes from Mark Massar with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Massar","Hey guys, thanks. So your large competitor commented that they saw utilization dip. Wanted to ask if you agree with that assessment, if it was anything beyond the customary July-August seasonality from the summer; and secondly, Dave, can you comment on your update--or, can you update your commentary on launching a direct-to-consumer business by the end of this year?","David King","Yes, first of all, we don\u2019t comment on other people\u2019s comments, so we commented on our results and, as we said, we had a very strong quarter from a volume perspective and we\u2019re very pleased with the outcome there.","In terms of the direct-to-consumer business, we have always said that when we launch our direct-to-consumer business, it\u2019s going to be responsible, it\u2019s going to be compliant, it\u2019s going to focus on the LabCorp quality and service with the medical and clinical support that we have always provided in our business-to-business, if you will, side of the business with physicians and hospitals, and other customers.","So we think the direct-to-consumer opportunity is important, it\u2019s a market that is growing, and consumers are more and more engaged in healthcare. But as we always do, it\u2019s going to be done in a clinically, medically and regulatory compliant fashion, and we are excited about the opportunity.","Mark Massar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, that concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Dave King, CEO for closing remarks.","David King","We thank you for joining us this morning, and wish you a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Frommer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Scott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning and welcome to LabCorp's third quarter 2018 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet.","With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","In addition to our press release, we also furnished Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call.

We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. LabCorp's results in the quarter were highlighted by year-over-year revenue growth of 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 16%. Our performance was driven by strong results of our Covance business this quarter with increased net orders, a 1.41 book-to-bill, organic revenue growth of over 7% and 130 basis points of margin expansion. These are clear indications that our investments in the business, our differentiated offering and our Covance LaunchPad process improvement initiative are combining to deliver results in the market.","In Diagnostics, excluding the impact of a ransomware attack in July and Hurricane Florence, we delivered 1.4% organic revenue and 1.9% organic volume growth. Nonetheless, this outcome was below our expectations with margin performance particularly disappointing and we are taking strong action as a result. First, we are making organizational changes to strengthen our leadership and operational performance.","Second, we are launching the next phase of Diagnostics LaunchPad which will result in multiyear cost savings of a similar magnitude to LaunchPad Phase I. Applying the same principles as before, process reengineering, automation, integration of new tools and technology and facility optimization, this phase of LaunchPad will build on our prior work and lead to an even more streamlined and efficient Diagnostics business. We will provide additional detail about the size and scope of LaunchPad Phase II on our next earnings call.","During the quarter, we continued to be good stewards of capital. We sharpened our life sciences focus by divesting our Food Solutions business at a very attractive valuation. As a result of the business divestiture, we exited the quarter in a strong cash position. We continued to develop our acquisition pipeline and increased share repurchases to $150 million. We are committed to supporting near and long term value creation for capital deployment, including share repurchases, internal capital investments, strategic acquisitions and debt paydown.","As Glenn will explain, we expect to deploy more capital in the fourth quarter and in 2019 towards share repurchases, which we will complement with financially sound acquisitions as we continue to create shareholder value.","I'll now update you on our progress on key strategic initiatives. The first strategic objective is to create a leading and differentiated consumer experience. We continue to enhance patient convenience and engagement, broaden our channel to market, and build brand loyalty.","Earlier this month, following positive results and very high Net Promoter Scores at our initial 17 sites, we announced an agreement to significantly expand our LabCorp-Walgreens collaboration to at least 600 locations. Consumers, healthcare providers and managed care plans have expressed strong interest in this innovative partnership. LabCorp and Walgreens complementary healthcare expertise underpins the LabCorp-Walgreens channel, which is uniquely situated to deliver a wide range of personalized, integrated, consumer-facing services over time.","Examples of additional collaboration opportunities under discussion include novel approaches to clinical research and supporting the ongoing transition to value-based care. We will begin announcing the newest LabCorp at Walgreens locations later this year.","Our consumer strategy also involves integrating new tools and technology into our offering. Toward this end we are preparing for the commercial launch of our convenient wellness testing with sample collection anywhere and personalized online results. This platform will extend consumer access to a high-quality, trusted lab testing into additional settings. Most immediate of these is reaching patients in the home, which is critical to designing care for high-need patients, that small cohort of complex needs who represent the greatest usage of the healthcare system.","Our initial offering went through the limited menu of tests focusing on wellness and chronic metabolic illness and we will expand the offering over time. This offering will also have application to our Covance business, as we support trials with convenient, accurate testing outside the physician office.","We also continued our rollout of patient self-service tools including self check-in, improved insurance card recognition technology using machine learning, enhanced mobile applications and upgraded online bill pay. Our multifaceted consumer engagement strategy is advancing at a rapid pace, further differentiating our offering from competitors and creating new opportunities for long-term profitable growth.","Our second strategic objective is to streamline the drug development process. We continue to execute on our $9.4 billion backlog, one of the largest in the industry, expand our customer base, win new awards through our integrated Covance and Chiltern offering, and make investments that increase efficiency in drug development.","Our investments encompass capabilities that support top line growth as well as enhance operational performance. Our Covance LaunchPad initiative includes over 90 projects and has had a clear impact on Covance's margins, which improved by 130 basis points year-on-year. The global service delivery model is well underway and will expand over the next two years. Other initiatives include the integration of new tools and technology into existing processes such as utilizing robotic, software process automation to enhance efficiency and quality.","Technology is a critical component of streamlining trials and we continue to see broad sponsor interest in our powerful investigator performance data, real-world evidence insights and Xcellerate platform. In the future, we expect to see increasing adoption of mobile health technology and virtual trials by sponsors. These offerings, individually or in combination, can speed patient recruitment and site selection, improve trial design and data quality, and thereby decrease study duration, costs and the patient burden of participating in clinical research.","Our third strategic objective is to support our customer's transition to value-based care. As discussed last quarter, our proven track record of delivering convenient high quality and cost-effective services translated into expanded opportunities and favorable reimbursement rates with UnitedHealthcare and Aetna. In anticipation of changes to each plan's laboratory provider network next year, our commercial and leadership teams continue to execute our provider engagement strategy. We're also developing an employer-focused offering to help self-insured businesses better manage both lab and drug spend.","The transition to value-based care is also relevant to providers. Last week we announced a comprehensive laboratory collaboration with Baptist Health, the largest not-for-profit system in Kentucky. As part of this collaboration, we will utilize our fully standardized laboratory solutions, operational expertise and comprehensive test menu to support the delivery of care across eight hospital-based labs.","The expansion of this long-standing partnership provides another example of hospitals and health systems turning to LabCorp's high-value offering to help them achieve their strategic and financial goals. We have an active pipeline of opportunities in this evolving market and look forward to providing you with updates in the future.","Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I will briefly comment about our outlook for 2019. Next year will be challenging due to the ongoing impact from PAMA and contractual changes in managed care. At the same time, we expect another year of revenue growth and margin expansion in Covance, cost savings in both businesses from the LaunchPad initiatives and strong free cash flow underpinned by a solid balance sheet.","In sum, although the headwinds facing our company will be at their stiffest next year, we expect to deliver modest growth in adjusted EPS in 2019 and to establish a solid foundation for accelerating growth in 2020 and beyond. Particularly, in light of the challenges we faced this quarter from the ransomware attack, Hurricane Florence and Typhoon Mangkhut, I want to recognize and commend the dedication of our 60,000 colleagues around the world. Their countless acts of individual and collective heroisms to take care of patients and of each other during these events made me once again enormously proud to lead this great company.","Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Andrew Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and include my commentary on our full year outlook. As a reminder, on January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, meaning that we restated our 2017 financial results to better enable the valuation of our 2018 performance and guidance.","In the press release, our prepared remarks and the Q&A session to follow, all references to our 2017 results are to the restated numbers unless we specifically note otherwise. During the quarter there were two usual events, the ransomware attack in July and Hurricane Florence in September. First, the ransomware attack impacted revenue by approximately $10 million and operating income by approximately $23 million. Of the $23 million total impact to operating income, $13 million has been classified as discrete expenses related to recovery efforts, including directly identifiable, overtime, consultant and contractor expenses. These discrete expenses have been excluded from the company's adjusted operating income.","The remaining $11 million reduced the company's adjusted operating income, primarily due to lower volume caused by our decision to temporarily take certain systems offline to contain and remediate the ransomware attack, as well as higher labor expense incurred to expedite processing of the built-up backlog. These metrics do not include any benefit from insurance recovery which we are pursuing.","Second, Hurricane Florence impacted revenue by approximately $4 million and adjusted operating income by approximately $3 million also due to lower volume. Together, these two unusual events negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.10. For the remainder of my remarks, I will refer to these two events together as business disruptions.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, an increase of 8% over last year, with acquisition growth of 6.5% and organic growth of 2.8%. This was partially offset by divestitures of 1.1% and unfavorable foreign currency translation of 30 basis points. Revenue growth was constrained by around 50 basis points due to business disruptions.","Operating income for the quarter was $343 million, or 12.1% of revenue, compared to $327 million or 12.5% last year. During the quarter we had $31 million of restructuring charges and special items, of which $13 million was due to discrete expenses related to recovery efforts following the ransomware attack. And the remaining $18 million was primarily related to our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative and acquisition integration.","Adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization and restructuring charges and special items, was $429 million, or 15.2% of revenue, compared to $432 million or 16.5% last year. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $13 million due to business disruptions. Excluding business disruptions, the $10 million increase was due to organic revenue growth, acquisitions, and savings from our LaunchPad initiative, partially offset by lower Medicare pricing as a result of the implementation of PAMA, divestitures, and personnel costs. The 130 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin was due to the implementation of PAMA, the negative impacts from business disruptions, and the mix impact from the acquisition of Chiltern.","The tax rate for the quarter was 36.2% compared to 34.7% last year. The adjusted tax rate, excluding special charges, amortization, and the net gain on divestitures, was 25%, down from 33.6% last year. This lower rate was primarily due to the implementation of tax reform in the U.S. We expect the full-year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24.5%, implying a fourth quarter tax rate of 25%.","Net earnings for the quarter were $319 million, or $3.10 per diluted share, which includes the net gain on divestitures of $125 million or $1.22 per share. Adjusted EPS, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges, special items, and the net gain on divestitures, were $2.74 in the quarter, up 16% over last year. Adjusted earnings in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per diluted share from business disruptions.","Operating cash flow was $252 million in the quarter compared to $351 million a year ago. The benefit of increased cash earnings was more than offset by an increase in working capital, a discretionary pension contribution, and the impact from business disruptions. The increase in working capital was used to support the company's growth, but was also negatively impacted by timing that will benefit the fourth quarter. We made the discretionary pension contribution to take advantage of the change in tax rates from tax reform.","Capital expenditures totaled $98 million, or 3.5% of revenue, compared to $75 million or 2.9% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $154 million in the quarter compared to $275 million last year.","During the quarter, we repurchased $150 million of stock. As of September 30, we had $844 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program.","Total debt at quarter end was $6.5 billion, and our leverage was 3.1 times gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA compared to our target leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times.","At quarter end, our cash balance was $893 million, up from $221 million at the end of the second quarter, primarily due to cash proceeds from the divestiture of the Food Solutions business. Between using excess cash on hand and free cash flow expected in the fourth quarter, we plan to deploy approximately $1 billion cash in the fourth quarter after capital expenditures. We will spend around half of this amount on the repayment of maturing debt of $400 million and a tax payment related to the Food Solutions divestiture of approximately $125 million. This leaves around $500 million available in the fourth quarter, primarily for increased share repurchases as well as strategic acquisitions.","Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion, a decrease of 0.2% compared to last year. The benefit from acquisitions and organic volume, measured by requisitions, was offset by the implementation of PAMA, the impact from business disruptions, as well as divestitures. Foreign currency translation lowered revenue by approximately 20 basis points.","The impact from unfavorable weather in the third quarter of last year was offset by the effect of approximately one less revenue day this quarter. As a result, organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis was 0.6%, which was lower than expected but included the negative impact from business disruptions of approximately 80 basis points.","Revenue per requisition decreased by 40 basis points excluding the impact from divestitures. This decline was driven by the impact of PAMA of 100 basis points as well as the impact from the ransomware attack of 20 basis points. On a similar basis, total volume increased 2%, of which organic volume was 1.3% and acquisition volume was 0.8%. We achieved this volume growth despite the negative impact of approximately 60 basis points from business disruptions.","LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $332 million, or 18.9% of revenue, compared to $374 million or 21.3% last year. The benefit from acquisitions and organic volume growth was more than offset by the negative impact from PAMA, business disruptions, divestitures, and personnel costs.","As Dave mentioned, given the outlook for 2019, we launched the next phase of our LabCorp Diagnostics LaunchPad initiative, as we position the business for growth in 2020 and beyond. We will provide details of this program on our year-end earnings call.","Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 25% over last year, due to growth from acquisitions of 18% and organic growth of 7%, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation.","Adjusted operating income for this segment was $131 million, or 12.1% of revenue, compared to $94 million or 10.8% last year. The $37 million increase in operating income and 130 basis point improvement in margins were primarily due to organic demand, LaunchPad savings and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on track to deliver $150 million of net savings from Covance LaunchPad by the end of 2020 and $30 million of cost synergies from the integration of Chiltern by the end of 2019.","Net orders during the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 35% from last year, contributing to a net book-to-bill for the quarter of 1.41 compared to 1.30 a year ago. For the trailing 12 months, net orders were $5.3 billion and net book-to-bill increased to 1.25 from 1.22 last quarter. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $9.4 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million from last quarter. We expect approximately $3.8 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","Now I'll discuss our 2018 guidance which assumes foreign exchange rates as of September 30 for the remainder of the year. Our guidance also includes capital allocation from the proceeds of divestitures and free cash flow in the fourth quarter toward an increase in our share repurchase program, acquisitions and debt repayment.","We expect revenue growth of 10.5% to 11% over 2017 revenue of $10.3 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 40 basis points of currency translation. This is a narrowing of our prior guidance range of 10.5% to 11.5% and now includes the impact from business disruptions of 10 basis points, as well as the 10 basis point unfavorable change in currency translation.","We expect LabCorp Diagnostics revenue growth of 3% to 3.5% over 2017 revenue of $6.9 billion, which includes a benefit of approximately 10 basis points of currency translation. This is a narrowing of our prior guidance range of 3% to 4.5%, primarily due to the impact from business disruptions of 20 basis points, lower volume and the 10 basis point unfavorable change in currency translation. We expect Covance Drug Development revenue growth of 24% to 26% over 2017 revenue of $3.5 billion which includes the benefit of approximately 110 basis points of currency translation. This is a narrowing of our prior guidance range of 23% to 26%. We remain on track to deliver mid to high single-digit organic growth in 2018.","Our adjusted EPS guidance is $11.25 to $11.45, which is lower than the prior guidance of $11.35 to $11.65, primarily due to the negative impact of $0.10 per share from business disruptions, as well as the performance in the third quarter.","Finally, we expect free cash flow to be between $975 million and $1.025 billion. This is lower than the prior guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion due to the upcoming tax payment of approximately $125 million related to the divestiture of the Food Solutions business which was not included in our prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks and we'll now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, gentlemen. So maybe let's start on Covance. I think relative to the prior quarter, across-the-board, the results were materially better and obviously, the bookings piece was probably the highlight and core growth was good as well. Maybe just give us a feel for kind of coming off of that sort of disappointment last quarter, what you saw change, how much of the stuff that sort of impacted you last Q is kind of temporal and you saw relief on it. And then on the margin side, also felt like as well, you got some of that drop-through on the better revenue, but also you're getting some momentum on the cost side.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. Thank you, Ross. This is John. In terms of the stronger book-to-bill, that was across all of our areas, early development, labs, clinical. It's driven by, yes, healthy market fundamentals, in terms of the funding environment, the approvals, the FDA, the high interest in the drug development innovation from ourselves. We do have strong pipeline of opportunities across the board in terms of proposals and continued success with our differentiation, whether that's with the data or the stronger FSP offerings or the solutions in terms of companion diagnostics or biomarkers.","But clearly, strength across the units. Yeah, second quarter, temporal. And I think you see why we lean toward more of a last 12 months versus, clearly, a quarter-by-quarter basis. And on the margin side, that's going to be a heavy lift in terms of on both the LaunchPad initiatives, as well as the revenue, but you're seeing that leverage come through and you're seeing that sequential leverage show up. In terms of the margin side \u2013 we see continued upside in terms of the margins. We know we need to get superior level margins and work to do in terms of the early development in clinical and know that both on the revenue and margin side, we're looking for continued progress there.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, John. And maybe, Dave, just sort of philosophically here, obviously, a lot of moving parts in the lab business and I'm sure you're not thrilled with some of the near-term pieces, albeit obviously a lot of it's out of your control. As you think about all the capital you have now, plus the Food divestiture and some of the activity picking up in the market and also having opportunity to deploy on the CRO set, I guess how are you thinking about it to next year? I know you talked about a pretty good return on capital in the fourth quarter, it seems like you also have plenty of firepower on the M&A side that continue to supplement, how are you thinking about the opportunity set that's out there?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","As we've said, we think about every opportunity that's presented to us individually and collectively. So individually, does it meet our strategic objectives? Does it meet our financial objectives? And what is the value to the total enterprise? And then collectively, how do we want to deploy our capital for growth?","And so what I would say is there's no predisposition toward deploying capital toward one business or another when it comes to acquisitions. We're going to look at every one individually. I will say that assuming that the second round of PAMA is implemented as planned, I think there will be acquisition opportunities on the lab side. I think there'll be collaboration opportunities on the health system side, as you seen in our broadened relationship with Baptist.","And so we have, in my mind, done a very good job of reducing our leverage and returning capital to shareholders and we're going to continue to tighten up that target leverage and, at the same time, maintain the flexibility of the balance sheet so that we can do the best deals that come along.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Good morning. First, congratulations on the great numbers on the Covance side. Dave, I'm going to ask about the Diagnostics side. So as I think about your expectations on the quarter versus what was delivered, you talked about organic being lower than expected. Your chief competitor reported yesterday, talked about patient concessions as well as some reimbursement issues.","Can you just walk us through, are you seeing similar things or are there different things that you're seeing for LabCorp versus Quest? Just want to understand the expectation versus what you delivered in the quarter and then also understand if there is a bad debt issue here?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. Good morning, Lisa. Thanks for the nice comments about Covance. We're very pleased with that performance. Our bad debt year-over-year is basically flat as a percentage. Now to be clear, as revenue grows, obviously, if you apply the same percentage, the dollars of bad debt get higher. But as a percentage of revenue \u2013 and I realize we account for it differently, but let's talk about the way we used to talk about in the old days \u2013 as a percentage of revenue, bad debt is basically flat. And in fact, in the year, from 1Q to 3Q, bad debt has sequentially declined each quarter. So we're not experiencing that headwind.","And I think \u2013 just make a comment that we do this internally, our revenue cycle management team has done a fantastic job. We do see higher patient responsibility across the board in the business, but our team has done a fantastic job; addressing and managing that through a lot of innovative tools, including front-end collections in the patient service center and our pricing transparency tool. So bad debt has not been a headwind.","On the specific callouts in terms of individual tests and payment denials, medical drug monitoring continues to grow although the growth rate is trending down. Some of that has been fewer scripts being written because of constraints on opioid prescriptions. Some of it is physicians insourcing the lab work because they can bill for it directly and get paid as opposed to sending it out to labs. And some of it has been denial policies. Now again, I want to come back to it grew, it just didn't grow at the rate that it has grown over prior quarters.","The hepatitis C and vitamin D, there's nothing materially different from what we've seen historically \u2013 what we have seen in prior quarters there. The one thing I would call out in terms of slowing the incremental growth is 23andMe was slower this quarter than it was in 2Q. And so that's where you saw some of the decline in organic growth, because as we've said, that is a contributor to our organic growth.","We expect that to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter. And so, that would probably be the one thing I would point out as a detractor in terms of organic growth rate. That said, the fact that 23andMe's volume growth rate slowed is part of the reason that you see our price \u2013 because again it's mix, it's not unit price but are price improvements because, as we've said, our profitability on 23andMe is fine but it is a lower per encounter price than our average requisition.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And you wouldn't say there's any changes on anything else from a managed care perspective or contracting when we think about the sequential Diagnostic business?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, not at all.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks, guys. Maybe just on the retail strategy with the Walgreens expansion, can you just kind of talk through what made you comfortable expanding that so significantly? I guess, what encouraged you about the initial locations? How should we be thinking about the economics of that versus some standalone patient centers?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. It's Dave. Start with the economics. So, the economics that we have worked out with Walgreens, we're pleased with in that they're essentially comparable to the economics of our standalone patient service centers. And the reason that we like the retail strategy is it's very difficult to identify are you getting incremental volume. But in the patient feedback that we're \u2013 the real-time patient feedback we're getting from those stores, we see a fairly significant number of patients who say either that they are new to LabCorp or that they haven't been to LabCorp in more than a year. And so we think it is increasing patient float versus the standalone patient service centers.","The other thing that's very attractive about it is the opportunity to provide broader health services to the patient. So whether it's biometric screening, whether it's drug monitoring and management through the collaboration of the pharmacists, whether it's presenting the patient with the opportunity to share their drug information, their pharmacy information and combine it with their lab information, or whether it's the clinical trials piece, we get a much more in-depth and robust engagement with the consumer in the Walgreens centers. And so that's why strategically we think it's very important as part of the consumer platform and increasing our ability to capitalize on the power of our data.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful, thanks. And then maybe just looking forward, I know you're not going to guide for 2019 by any means, but I think increasingly focus is shifting there, and I think the headwinds on profitability are pretty well understood at this point. But maybe just help us think about some levers to offset some of those headwinds. Whether fundamental underlying trends, pull-through on new LaunchPad initiatives, it would be helpful just to hear your perspective on 2019.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Let me just say \u2013 I said in the prepared remarks the headwinds in 2019 will be the stiffest, and they will, but let's do two things. Number one, in the near term, obviously we'll get some savings on both sides of the business from LaunchPad. Number two, the growth in Covance and the opportunity in Covance will significantly offset the impact for us of what's going to happen with PAMA, for example, in the Diagnostics business. Number three, we have a significant amount of capital that we can deploy toward growth in the business, whether through share repurchase or through acquisitions.","But I also want to just take a step further back and say from a broader perspective, we need to reemphasize to the community and to our investors, when you think about healthcare and think about what are the key elements of healthcare, you're seeing all sorts of innovation around, whether it's digital and bricks-and-mortar, whether it's providers who are not physicians, whether it's emergency rooms that aren't part of hospitals. But one thing that is fundamental about healthcare is that the front line of diagnosis is in the laboratory. And it's inconceivable that there's going to be any healthcare system ever without the clinical laboratory.","So as we think about where we are, we have capital to deploy. We're a scale business. The market trends are moving in our direction, whether it's sales of assets, whether it's hospitals, hospital collaborations, whether it's hospital outsourcing. And also think about the demographics of 10,000 people a day turning 65 and becoming eligible for Medicare and increasing coverage under whatever structure we're going to have for the insurance markets.","So for the long term, our perspective is we're in a great business. The scale is there. The leverage is there. It generates a ton of cash flow. And I look at 2019 as a year in which yes, there are going be some challenges, but in the long term, we're building for a significant opportunity to grow the business on the Covance side, on the lab side in the out years, and we feel very optimistic about where we are.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Dave, I wanted to continue on that line, and I really appreciate all the commentary on 2019. I think PAMA and LaunchPad are pretty quantifiable. But is there any additional visibility you can provide on the impact of the national payer changes, whether it be on both the volume impact and on the pricing side? That would be helpful.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Jack. The volume side is very difficult to estimate or quantify, and so I'm not going to try and do that. On the pricing side, with United, we said that our position in the negotiations was that if they were going to open the contract that we felt we were entitled to an increase in price \u2013 unit price. And we said at the time that the contract negotiation concluded that we were very pleased with the outcome. So I think you can draw your conclusion there in terms of what the pricing is going to be.","With Aetna, all in, we view the pricing that we receive as relatively flat. And so I don't see significant price-downs in the transition of the managed care from going out of network with Aetna to going in or from the United contract change.","Now at the risk of being accused of talking down the year, which I'm not, but I'm just doing simple math for you, I will say, as I said on the last call, the math tells you that with United having the larger membership and Aetna having the smaller membership that the contract transition will be a net headwind for us. But it's not going to be a net headwind because of price-downs. In my view, it's going to be a net headwind just because the mat says if each national lab loses the same percentage of customers that they had in the prior exclusive arrangement, we will lose more than our competitor.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's fair. Glenn or Dave, I had one follow-up on the operating income in the Diagnostics segment for the quarter. So it was down a little over $40 million year over year. The business impact, you quantified that as $13 million. I'm estimating PAMA is about $17 million. You also had the Eurofins sale. Is there anything else to call out in terms of the segment earnings of this quarter, whether it be a positive or negative just year over year?","Glenn Andrew Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","The positives obviously would be the organic volume that we did have as well as acquisitions. To your point, we gave up some of that with the divestitures. And the other is really just we talked about the personnel cost or costs that while volumes were up, they were down a little bit from where we had expected it. Our cost structure was supporting the higher levels. And part of LaunchPad and part of what we expect to be an improvement as we go into the fourth quarter will be taking down those costs to more right-size with the current level of demand.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Dave, I wanted to go back to your prepared remarks. I think you made comments about organizational changes. Were there any more details you can provide, or was that already covered?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Kevin. We will provide more details of it, but basically, the organizational changes are just to, as we said, streamline organizational leadership and improve our focus. The volume growth, when you take out all the puts and takes, we were satisfied within the quarter. But the margin and, as Glenn said, the level of expense was a frustration, and we're going to manage that better, and that's basically what the structural changes are designed to do.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Got it, okay. And then just going back to your comments on the national payer change transition even with United having more members than Aetna, are you just taking a more conservative stance here? Or because \u2013 I guess we thought that more of the volume shift between the two largest labs would come from some of the smaller labs versus each other. I guess, can you help us understand that dynamic?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","My sense from the market, Kevin, is that our competitor has been aggressively targeting our accounts where we have United business. And so certainly there'll be some volume shifting from regional labs, but it's no secret that we're the two largest and so if you're looking to gain volume with a contract change, where are you going to go? You're going to go to the largest target. And we have the largest share of United business. So it certainly seems natural to me that our competitors is targeting our accounts.","So I agree with you there'll be some shifting from the regionals, but if you just think about who had the largest single share of the United business, that would be us. Where's the greatest opportunity for Quest to gain share? That would be from us, and that's why we expect that there'll be some \u2013 there'll be volume loss for us and volume gain for them.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Got it, okay. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Your line is now open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. I just want to go back to 2019. And again, I know you don't want to explicitly guide, but hoping, Dave, you can give a little more on your definition of modest growth. Is that low single, mid-single, high single? Is that EPS including share repo or just operating earnings? And any further details you may be willing to give on margin \u2013 just overall margin expectation structure? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We'll give our guidance when we do the 4Q call, Ralph. So modest means modest, and until we put a number on it, modest is going to be what it is. Modest EPS growth includes capital deployment, so it includes share repurchase, acquisitions, all of the components. And we're not going to say anything about margins other than, as a result of the Covance LaunchPad process, as John said, we expect to see margin improvement there. Diagnostics margins, because of the impact of PAMA, will likely be flat to down. But again, we don't guide, generally, to margins. So that's probably about all that I can say.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, all right, fair enough. And then I did want to go to the organic volume. It was positive but, again, it did slow, and I know you mentioned some of the business disruption impact. But anything you're seeing from the UNH book of business, specifically in terms of maybe early share shift away from you that you can comment on? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, we're not seeing anything significant in terms of early share shift. And remember, to that end, that we are still the sole exclusive national provider for United up through the end of the year. So any early share shift would mean moving from an in-network provider, if they're going to our competitor, to an out-of-network provider, and that's not something that is good for patients. It's not good for the system. So we're not seeing much. And my expectation is we're not going to see much until the first of the year.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, thanks. It was a nice book-to-bill trend in the CRO business and were there any outside business wins on the CRO side? Or I guess how broad-based was it? And I'm curious if you could comment on your win rates overall when leveraging the combined data assets across both the Covance and LabCorp side of the business? Thanks.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Great. Erin, this is John. And there was no outsized wins. There was nothing above 10% of bookings, the $1.5 billion. So it's pretty broad-based. Nice wins in terms of aggregate on the early development, the lab side and clinical. And then your second question was again? Sorry, I apologize.","Glenn Andrew Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","The data rate and...","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Oh, the win rate.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Win rate.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, leveraging the data assets.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Clearly, that is our differentiation. We're seeing clearly a vast majority of our trials and proposals using the data. We're up to around two-thirds and moving to three-quarters of the use of the data in all of our wins and all of our proposals, and looking to move that then to 100% of the trials. So we are using it in accordance with the high interest from our drug development partners and clearly making us stronger in terms of our pipeline of opportunities.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. A quick follow-up on the Walgreens relationship here. I guess, can you comment a little bit more on timing, magnitude, when this sort of will really materialize here, and how you're kind of balancing that with your needs for your own patient service centers? And I know you commented on that before, but I guess, do your thoughts embed some sort of way to productively rationalize some of the footprint here in a capital-efficient manner? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Erin, it's Dave. You're going to see a pretty substantial acceleration through the balance of this year into next year in terms of the opening of new stores. Obviously, there's a buildout in many of the stores required and that's sort of the gating factor.","When we originally started the project, we did not anticipate that we would be relocating patient service centers, we viewed this as another channel. But what we've seen is really nice traffic coming from existing patient service centers into Walgreens. So we'll be looking at the existing patient service center structure to determine whether there are opportunities to essentially move them to Walgreens or combine them with the Walgreens capabilities.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. So first of all, just following up on this last comment, so when we think about 2019, you're saying you're building out Walgreens facilities but you haven't made a decision yet on how to rationalize existing infrastructure. Should we assume in our models some duplicate cost structure?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, Ricky, no. It's Dave. Sorry, I didn't understand the key word there. No you should not assume duplicate cost structure. Whatever we do with Walgreens will be sequenced with the patient service center infrastructure.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, Dave, in your prepared remarks when you talked about 2019, you also highlighted that 2020, you're going to see return to growth. So just to clarify, we're going to see another PAMA step-down in 2020, so are you basically saying that taking into account that PAMA step-down, you can return the top line growth in 2020?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes, I think we can, Ricky. And by the way, I'm not going to say we won't have top line growth in 2019. I still think there'll be top line growth because we're expecting, obviously, growth in Covance. But once we annualize the impact of the managed care contract changes, which will be at the end of 2019, then in my view, absolutely, 2020, yes, we have incremental PAMA impact, assuming that we don't get any relief on that, and we're proceeding under that assumption but still working very hard to get relief. But assuming we don't get a relief, we still will have the opportunity to return to top line and stronger earnings growth.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions on the Covance business, could you just give any color in terms of what the growth rates were and split was between your early and late-stage businesses? And then as a follow-up on that, if my memory serves, Covance was a strategic partner for Bayer and I know they've discussed increasing some of their outsourcing potentially going forward. I'm just curious in terms of is that a chance of gaining some incremental business from Bayer. Are you still tight with them?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","This is John. Derik. And so we don't really break out the actual segments, all I will do in terms of color was the early development versus labs versus the clinical side. All areas grew. And in terms of the revenue growth, early development led the parade, so nice growth from that segment, but growth across the board. And then on Bayer, very specifically, we don't really talk customer specifics. They've been a great partner to us and continue to be so.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I'll do one lab follow-up. Are you still expecting, when you're modeling the contract changes, for the bulk of that to be in the first half of next year?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Just a quick question, Dave. In your prepared remarks, you talked about physicians doing more in-office testing. Is that a structural trend that we should be worried about? And then just broadly speaking, as you think about overall demand, am I right in interpreting your comments that you don't have any worries, it's just that you have these one-off situations this past Q3?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. Good morning, Brian. I don't think in my prepared remarks that I said there was more physician in-office testing. I think what I said was that, in terms of the Covance business and the new platform that we're launching, that we thought we had the opportunity to provide self-collection outside the physician office that could be relevant to trial. So maybe I wasn't as clear on that as I should have been.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, Dave, sorry. I meant on the prescription drug monitoring business, I think.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Oh yeah, that's really specifically an issue in prescription drug monitoring at the moment. And historically, what happens is when there's an area of testing that is growing rapidly, you may remember, if you covered the space years ago, there was all the insourcing of pathology and there were all these shell labs set up to do pathology testing. And there's typically a pretty strong regulatory response when physicians start doing significant insourcing, simply because it leads to significant increases in utilization which are not necessarily, again, either in the best interest of the patient or the system.","So, I see this as a near-term trend in one specific area of the business. I wouldn't characterize it as a long-term trend. And in-office physician testing as a total percentage of the lab market has basically been in the low single-digits throughout \u2013 certainly throughout my career in the industry. So, no, don't see that as a particularly alarming trend, more as a temporal issue.","In terms of third quarter incidents being one-offs, obviously, the weather is a constant. It's just an unpredictable constant. The ransomware, we certainly hope is a one-off. But let's be realistic, I mean every business today, and certainly healthcare businesses among them, is constantly being attacked. And so I think our team did a phenomenal job responding. I think our security is high, and we continue to increase our investment in IT security. But you can never \u2013 it certainly isn't going to be a continuing issue. We're not seeing continuing implications of it. So I would say these are singular events and not things that we need to be thinking are going to persist in the long run.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","No, I appreciate it, and just one quick follow-up for John. As I think about Covance with LaunchPad and Chiltern synergies coming in, where do you think we can take margins to? 18% to 20%, is that a reasonable number to be thinking about over time?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I know we'll do on the next call our 2019 guidance, so we'll talk more tactically about that. But we're looking at peer-level margins, and so you can look at the industry and then know that we have work to do in terms of the clinical and then on the early development, so we see opportunity there. But we'll give more details on the next quarterly call.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thank you and good morning, everyone, two questions. I guess first off, I want to go back to one of the earlier Walgreens questions. Dave, you referenced additional services that you could provide, which presumably over time would lead to higher volumes. It is this something that you're seeing now in the pilot program, or should we be thinking about this as a future opportunity to help drive, call it, same-store sales or higher volume growth in that segment?","And then secondly, John, any comment on pricing? You obviously referenced the healthy market on several occasions, so curious about your thoughts there and then just overall industry capacity. Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Bill. It's Dave. On Walgreens, what we've done in the initial 17 service centers is basically set up the capability of providing the draws in the lab services. In many of our patient service centers now, we do have additional capabilities to do things like biometric screening for employers or indeed for our own employees, and we'll be migrating those into the Walgreens stores.","The other thing to think about is in the prototype of these Walgreens stores is, there are other health-related activities there. There's a pharmacy. There might be audiology. There might be vision. There might be an urgent care. So all of these things will combine to give a broader opportunity for the patient to have a comprehensive healthcare experience, in some of these cases, even almost a quasi-primary care experience and for us to capitalize on a more robust engagement with the consumer around the data, around the biometrics, around information that would be really helpful for us to have that, in many cases, because we don't see the patient in person, we don't collect. Now I'll ask John on the Covance pricing question that you asked.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Early development, capacities are tight. Pricing is good. The labs, pricing will always be under pressure but thus the need to be more efficient and effective and best-in-class margins there. And then on clinical, the FSP model pricing is a lot of pressure. But again, that forces you though into the automation technology, tools, process work that we're doing in order to better those margins.","And on the programmatic side, from the standpoint of pricing, a normal environment, we're moving a lot more to milestone pricing and saying deal in terms of looking for margin upside in that environment to offset even the pressure on the pricing.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Massaro of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, thank you. Dave, it seems like the market is pricing and certainly PAMA here to stay, and you're managing the business for Phase 2 of PAMA to be implemented on January 1. But can you just speak to any actions that ACLA is making now in terms of legal options and lobbying Congress? And can you give us any sense of substance or timing as it relates to any further actions?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. Good morning, Mark. I'll start with the legal actions. So the district court decision was disappointing. Putting on my long-abandoned lawyer hat, I can say that the judge decided the case on very narrow procedural grounds. And although she noted that there were significant questions presented on the merits, she didn't reach them. She didn't reach one of the key arguments that ACLA made, which was that the regulations were beyond CMS's authority because they were directly contradictory to the statue.","So ACLA, after a board discussion and I think correctly has decided to appeal and file the Notice of Appeal. We'll ask for an expedited schedule, but the reality is the likelihood of getting a decision before the middle to end of 2019 is pretty low from the Court of Appeals. So we'll continue to press on the legal front, but the process now will play itself out.","On the regulatory and legislative front, we are very active with Congress. There is, if I can characterize it, a general sense within the key committees and staff and among members that this was not what was intended, that it was not expected that 70% to 80% of the data points were going to come from LabCorp and Quest, and this was going to be a cherry-picked \"market analysis\" that would just pick the lowest price for everything. And so they were looking at potential fixes. ACLA has submitted some language that has been sent for scoring that would provide a near-term fix. So there's a considerable amount of activity on the Congressional front.","And then we continue to meet and discuss with CMS what administrative options there may be as well. As you saw in the physician fee schedule proposed rule, CMS asked about ways in which they could include more hospital data, and we've been meeting with them recently and have made a number of proposals. One of the initial objections from hospitals was the amount of resources that would be required to report the data. And so we've provided some proposals to CMS around things like aggregate data reporting as statistically significant surveys that would allow them to look at that market without the enormous burden of reporting.","So there is a lot of activity on every front, and I'm still optimistic that common sense is going to prevail here in terms of what PAMA was meant to do and how it's going to be implemented. But as you say, we're planning as though PAMA is going to be fully implemented, and we're running the business that way.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And historically, you've called out areas like women's health and NIPT as strong growth areas. Is that still the case? And then in terms of next-gen sequencing-based tools like liquid biopsies, can you comment on the degree of importance that is both in your Diagnostics and your CRO business? And are there ways that you can advance those offerings?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Women's health and NIPT continue to be strong areas of growth for us. Next-gen sequencing is a part of the lab business in both LabCorp and Covance, mostly in terms of moving existing genetic testing or genomic testing onto that platform as opposed to SNP arrays or other prior methodologies. And innovations like liquid biopsy and other technologies are certainly things that we're considering.","In both businesses, we actually have a pilot program running within Covance on liquid biopsies. So these are going to be things \u2013 the technology and the tools continue to change and we're going to continue to adopt them as they make sense, as they provide improved patient care and obviously as we see reimbursement trends.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave King for any closing remarks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you. Well, thank you for joining us this morning. I hope we've given you not only clear insight into the third quarter but also into the long-term view that we have of the business and the success of our strategic execution. We look forward to speaking to you on the fourth quarter call and wish you a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

My name is Cheney, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now turn the presentation over to your host for today, Mr. David King, Chairman and CEO. Please proceed, sir.","David P. King","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today from LabCorp are Brad Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; Adam Feinstein, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy; and Steve Anderson, Vice President, Investor Relations.","This morning, we will discuss our third quarter 2012 financial results, update our 2012 guidance, highlight our progress on our Five Pillar Strategy and provide answers to several frequently asked questions.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Anderson, who has a few comments before we begin.","Stephen Anderson","Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via the telephone and Internet. Please refer to today's press release for replay information.","This morning, the company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information.","Additionally, we refer you to today's press release, which is available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS, adjusted EPS excluding amortization, free cash flow and adjusted operating income.","I would also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the company's financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2011 10-K and subsequent filings. The company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now Brad Hayes will review our financial results.","William B. Hayes","Thank you, Steve. On today's call, I will review 4 key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. I'll also update our 2012 guidance.","First, cash flow. Our cash flow remained strong. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2012, was $723.3 million. DSO was 48 days at the end of September, an increase of 1 day sequentially and an increase of 2 days year-over-year.","During the quarter, our bad debt rate was 4.3%. Cash receipts at the end of the quarter were lower than anticipated, but we expect them to recover during the fourth quarter.","Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 1.1% year-over-year in the third quarter. During the quarter, total company volume increased 1.4% year-over-year. There was 1 less revenue day in the third quarter compared with last year.","On a per-day basis, volume increased 3.1%, and organic volume increased 0.5%. Esoteric volume per day increased approximately 2.2% in the quarter. Revenue per requisition decreased 0.3% year-over-year. Revenue per requisition was negatively impacted by the MEDTOX acquisition and continued challenges in histology.","Third, margin. For the third quarter our adjusted operating income margin was 18.2% compared to 18.8% in the third quarter of 2011. One fewer revenue day compared to last year had a 50-basis-point negative impact on operating margin. Also, the MEDTOX acquisition negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison.","Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of September, we had cash of $466 million and $1 billion available under our credit facility. During the third quarter, we repurchased $127.8 million of stock representing 1.4 million shares. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $380.4 million of stock representing 4.3 million shares.","At the end of September, $204 million of repurchase authorization remained under our share repurchase program. In August, we completed a $1 billion bond offering that consisted of 2 tranches: $500 million of 2.2% senior notes due 2017 and $500 million of 3.75% senior notes due 2022. As previously disclosed, the proceeds were used to pay the balance of our existing credit facility and for general corporate purposes.","Finally, we benefited from a lower tax rate in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date tax rate in line with the first 3 quarters of 2011.","This morning, we updated our 2012 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of 2.5%, adjusted EPS excluding amortization in the range of $6.88 to $6.93 excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after September 30, 2012. Operating cash flow of approximately $915 million and capital expenditures of approximately $145 million.","I will now turn the call over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Brad. We are pleased with our performance given that we continue to face a very difficult economic environment. During the quarter, on a per day basis, volume increased more than 3% year-over-year and organic volume was positive. Taking into account one fewer day in the quarter, operating income margin was essentially flat.","We continue to generate strong operating and free cash flow, which we both invested in the business and returned to shareholders through share repurchase. We grew adjusted earnings per share of 9.3% and 9.8% year-to-date on a year-over-year basis, and we continued to measurably reduce selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue.","We continue to make progress on each aspect of our Five Pillar Strategy. The first pillar of our strategy is that we deploy our cash to enhance our presence in key markets and our test menu and to repurchase shares. In July, we closed our acquisition of MEDTOX Scientific, a premier forensic and clinical laboratory with a diverse test menu and a reputation for exceptional quality, dependability and customer service. We were excited about the opportunity to grow MEDTOX's specialized toxicology testing business and we welcome the talented MEDTOX employees into our LabCorp family.","The integrations of our acquisitions are going well and are in line with our expectations. We continue to realize synergies on schedule and to offer new services in genetics, oncology and esoteric toxicology. Finally, we have repurchased 4.3 million shares at a cost of $380.4 million year-to-date.","The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. After a successful pilot of our Beacon Patient Portal early in the year, we expanded the rollout to 3 of our 6 divisions nationwide. The portal is a secure and easy-to-use online solution that enables patients to receive and share lab results, make appointments, pay bills, set up automatic alerts and notifications and manage health information for the entire family. We have experienced fast adoption, maintaining growth of more than 2,100 new patient registrations per week, and we remain on track to launch the portal to the remaining divisions this year.","Our electronic medical record connectivity continues to expand. We have added over 6,000 new client EMR interfaces year-to-date and are on pace to exceed our goal of 7,500 new connections in 2012. We remain committed to our open platform strategy, allowing our customers to connect seamlessly to LabCorp directly or via the EMR of their choice.","The third pillar of our strategy is to continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. During the quarter, we made significant progress in the rollout of our advantage positive ID system, which is now implemented in more than 40% of our core histology sites. This system standardizes workflow, eliminates waste and positively identifies specimens throughout processing.","In the fourth quarter, we will complete the rollout of our new handheld courier communication devices. This enhancement provides greater visibility in the specimen collection enables more robust route engineering and increases courier efficiency. Given the persistently weak volume environment, we continue to closely review our cost structure.","The fourth pillar of our strategy is to continue scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We introduce new tests and collaborate with leading companies and academic institutions to provide our physicians and patients with the most scientifically advanced testing in our industry.","During the quarter, we broadened the options for genetic carrier screening among our women's health offerings. We launched the inherent test carrier screen, which allows us to provide relevant genetic screening for many inherited diseases found throughout the pan-ethnic U.S. population. The panel represents a collection of common diseases in the U.S. general population, and we expect it to address needs for multiple ethnic-based testing scenarios. In addition, our genetic counselors will provide telephone or televideo support for patients using our inherent test carrier screening.","Sequencing is an emerging tool to support molecular diagnostics, due to the rapid evolution of next-generation sequencing technology. We are well underway in our plans to support the launch of new testing panels. The transition of current testing to this platform will offer a more comprehensive content relative to our current platforms. As part of these ongoing efforts, we participated in a recent financing round for Foundation Medicine. Foundation is a leader in the use of next-generation sequencing to assist in treatment decisions for cancer patients by looking at patient-specific molecular changes in tumors. The information is used to report targeted therapies and relevant clinical trials specific to individual patients.","The fifth pillar of our strategy is to develop alternative delivery models. We continue to discuss alternative models with managed care partners, health systems and physician groups so that we will be well positioned in the future.","As part of our BeaconLBS implementation, we are pleased to announce the introduction of our first-generation point-of-care decision support product, which interfaces with our lab test ordering system. Providing physicians with convenient point-of-care decision support tools will facilitate evidence-based test selection, helping them choose the right test for the patient at the right time. Physicians, patients and our managed care partners will benefit from this product innovation, which has been designed to improve quality and more effectively manage costs without disrupting workflow.","We have conducted 3 physician pilots in Florida, and these physician offices overwhelmingly told us that our decision support product was easy to use, beneficial to patient care and made their practices more effective.","Health systems provide outstanding lab services, but most of these businesses make a small profit or operate at a loss. Changes in test mix, reduced reimbursement from government and private payors for all services not just lab, and increasing cost of providing services make health systems more interested than they had been in the past in broad collaborations. LabCorp offers a broader test menu, greater affordability for patients and payors and the highest levels of quality and service to health systems and the communities they serve. We will continue to pursue this key initiative to offer an enterprise-wide solution that will provide health systems, patients, physicians and payors with the highest quality diagnostic testing through the lowest cost delivery model.","In summary, we are pleased with the quarter and the progress we achieved on our Five Pillar Strategy. Now, Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Stephen Anderson","Thank you, Dave. \"Can you describe the impact of the Medicare reimbursement tests you will face in 2013?\"","Absent any additional congressional action through the end of the year, we would anticipate an approximate 2.75% reduction to the clinical lab fee schedule beginning January 1, 2013. The Affordable Care Act baseline for the 2013 update to the clinical lab fee schedule will be a negative 0.75% effective January 1, 2013 based upon the recently published CPI-U and productivity adjustment figures. As part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, the clinical lab fee schedule will be re-baselined an additional 2% lower effective January 1, 2013. Separately, if mandatory sequestration is carried out, we will receive a 2% payment reduction in the clinical lab fee schedule effective February 1, 2013. Together, these reductions sum to an approximate annualized 4.75% total reduction to the clinical lab fee schedule, which represents approximately 12% of our revenue. On an annualized basis, we estimate that these reductions will lower our 2013 EPS by approximately $0.20. In addition to the reduction in the clinical lab fee schedule, mandatory sequestration will impose a 2% reduction in the physician fee schedule effective February 1, 2013. The physician fee schedule represents approximately 2% of our total revenue. On an annualized basis, we estimate that this reduction will lower our 2013 EPS by approximately $0.02.","\"Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing?\"","For the year, approximately 40% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. As we reiterated last quarter, our goal is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 45% of our total revenue within the next 3 to 5 years.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve, and thank you very much for listening. We are now ready to take your questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, just first question. With all the focus on volumes these days, Dave, do you guys have a view or what is your view toward sort of what underlying market growth is out there?","David P. King","I think it would be hard to characterize underlying market growth just given all of the -- actually, I'd put all the different sites of care. Obviously, the market is growing more slowly than it has historically. I'd just -- I'd be reluctant to put a specific number on it. But my general sense from colleagues and peers is that the rate of growth has definitely slowed and that the growth rates that you're seeing from independent labs across the board is probably somewhat impacted by shifting in sites of care, particularly hospital acquisitions of physicians. So what you're seeing in terms of growth and obviously, you're not seeing hospitals reporting public -- publicly reporting their lab numbers. But what you're seeing in terms of overall market growth is somewhat impacted by just shifting in market dynamics.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay. and then maybe on that topic as a follow-up, since the physician employment by hospital seems to be shifting to the lab testing over, what's sort of your sense -- I guess, there seems to be 2 pieces of this equation here. What's your sense of sort of where we are in that shift? But number 2, you also mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks that health systems are maybe more interested in working with you or others to sort of put that testing in the most efficient setting. So where are we on both of those sides of the equation?","David P. King","I think there has been really over the last couple of years a sizable movement toward hospital acquisition of physician practices, and we certainly see it in the marketplace. It started with what I would characterize as smaller practices. And now it's probably more moved into midsize practices. There's also a lot of consolidation going on even among physician practices. And when physicians consolidate their practices to get scale, many of them think about a physician office lab to do some on-site testing. So that has been I would say an accelerating trend. Is it -- I've seen numbers thrown around that say 50% of physicians work for hospitals or 50% of new physicians coming out of medical school are going to work for hospitals. I think those numbers are on the high side. But there's definitely movement toward more hospital or health system employed or integrated delivery network employed physicians. And that's definitely -- it's -- that's a headwind. It's not a gale force headwind, but it's a headwind for us in terms of growth because we're seeing a shift in site of testing. The other side of that is, that shift in site of testing also brings a significant increase in cost of lab services. And so I think over time, there will be increasing pressure on the health systems to reduce the cost of lab services, indeed to reduce the cost of all of their non-core services, and that will be to the benefit of large, independent laboratories and certainly to our benefit.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just one clarification and then I'll hop off. On your revenue growth guidance, it was 2 to 3. Now it's sort of 2.5. But I know before it didn't specifically include MEDTOX. But you do sort of include some acquisitions in there generally speaking. SO how do you guys use the adjustment to guidance when you put those moving parts together?","William B. Hayes","Tom, this is Brad. It does include MEDTOX. I would say that given there's not far to go here in the quarter, that wouldn't assume much else.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. So -- but if we take that old 2 to 3, which didn't include MEDTOX, I don't think -- and now the new 2.5, which does include MEDTOX, did you shift your underlying expectations at all or how do we think about that piece of it?","William B. Hayes","Yes, I think if you went back and looked from the original guidance and as you say, let's go back to the second quarter guidance, it was 2 to 3 excluding. If we're now 2.5 including, and it's pretty easy to do the math on what MEDTOX is likely contributing about 1 point there, so that 2.5 is 1.5 excluding any acquisitions, any major acquisitions like a MEDTOX. So yes, I'd say we're below that 2 to 3 from the second quarter.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Good. I just want to make sure there wasn't any other moving parts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, I believe one of the comments was that the average volume per testing day was up 3%. Can you maybe give a little bit more color around that?","William B. Hayes","Yes, Gary. This is Brad. Obviously it was driven by again, MEDTOX, which contributed, because of the nature of that business, a high amount of volume and also had a negative impact on price. We did also say that our organic volume, which would've excluded MEDTOX and Orchid, was 0.5% per day in the quarter. So that actually, and Dave mentioned this in his prepared remarks, that was better than what we saw in Q2 on an organic basis, which was I think negative 0.5%. But we do analyze the business on a per day basis. It rarely makes a difference in the quarter, but in the third quarter we needed to call it out.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe going back to the comments and the discussion around the potential opportunities for partnerships with hospitals. I guess, there's been a discussion of this for a long time. It sounds like it's coming to a head. I guess, could you maybe just anticipate kind of the rate with which opportunities or deals may happen or is this still something that is pretty kind of long term in nature?","David P. King","I think there's -- Gary, it's Dave. I think there's a much higher level of interest in collaborative models with hospitals than there has been historically. That said, these things do not move quickly. And so when you think about when does the revenue impact come from a -- when do you sit down to start having these conversations and when is there actual revenue impact -- it's not unusual particularly if there's some kind of a joint operating model, it's not unusual for transactions like this to take a year, to take 18 months to come to fruition. So in some we continue to work on, I think there's a greater sense of urgency on the health systems side now. Obviously, they're looking at some payment reductions at the first of 2013. They're looking at sequestration, same headwinds that we have. So I think I feel good about where we are in terms of capitalizing on the opportunity, but they take a while to develop.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just maybe one final follow-up. Just in terms of thinking about the structure of those partnerships, would they be essentially LabCorp purchasing the business from the hospitals or would they be some kind of joint venture partnership with the hospitals? How are you thinking about that?","David P. King","I think there's a wide variety of options. Historically, we've had sizable lab management relationships with hospitals, where we run their laboratories. We've had sizable joint venture relationships, where there's an ownership percentage that the health system owns. And we've had outreach acquisitions as well. So we're flexible, and a lot of it depends on the needs of the health system when they -- when we sit down and talk to them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, there's a lot of focus on the near term. There's been some talk in the industry, however, about a kind of a long-term return to historical growth rate in the 5% to 6% range. Is that remotely a realistic possibility now with some of the reimbursements and other challenges you face? And if so, how and when do you get to that kind of an experience?","David P. King","Bob, I still believe that in the long term, we are a 4% to 6% top line growth industry and for a variety of reasons. I mean, first of all, the technological developments and the advances that we're making in laboratory testing are - we say we're 3% of the spend, driving 70% of the decisions. We are increasingly becoming a smaller percentage of the spend as other expenses go up at a more rapid pace. And yet we're driving more and more of the decisions. And I look at things like cancer diagnostics, next-generation sequencing technology for prenatal genetics and for target therapies for cancer patients. I look at HCV and the opportunity in the HCV screening and with the new therapies that are being developed with matching HCV patients to the right therapy. And the list just goes on and on and on in terms of where the growth opportunities are for our industry. I don't think it's any secret that right now, given a very tough economic environment and a very tough utilization environment and a lot of pressure to reduce costs, we're struggling to grow as are all healthcare services businesses really. So I'm not discouraged about the long-term as I sit and look at the things that we're working on and the opportunities that are ahead of us. Yes, I'm more encouraged than ever about the long-term and about being able to return to 4% to 6% growth. But I think I've been pretty clear that it's not going to be next year, and we should start to see some improvement in 2014 and in the years beyond. And a lot of what we're doing in terms of capital investments and IT investments and investments in partnerships is building the platform for what -- where we think the business is going to go on in the future when we do return to that growth environment.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Do you think you're well positioned if it's this higher-end testing opportunity, which I agree with you is significant, but can it really offset some of the hospital insourcing and histology challenges? I mean, you mentioned a few things here. Do you have the assets in place to enable you to grow when that market does turn? Or will this be a continued focus on deals to kind of bolster your capabilities there?","David P. King","I think we have done a great job of building ahead. I think if you look back a couple of years ago and think about the initiatives that we undertook, I mean, we've always been about efficiency in the cost structure, and we've been standardized for longer than I can remember. And when we make acquisitions, we standardize them right away and we integrate them right away. We implemented the touch system, we -- for our patient service centers to not only improve the patient experience but our phlebotomy experience. So we've made the investments in the core infrastructure, Sysmex, to make the labs run better and be at the right point from a cost perspective. We're never done with that. There's always more that one can do from a cost perspective. On the other side of the equation, where we put our capital to work, when we started saying 2 years ago that we were investing in the ability to help physicians with decision support to the point of care and better test management and test selection, we got some raised eyebrows because that's not traditionally been the role of the lab. But as you think about more and more molecular testing, physicians being more and more overwhelmed with test selection at the point of care, my view, we built exactly what we need. We're well ahead of the market in terms of the services that we offer and something that I think in the long run really has the ability to move the needle for us. And then the investments in things like next-generation sequencing, and the investment in Genzyme Genetics and all the things we've done to enhance the test menu -- even MEDTOX, which looked like a routine acquisition and in some ways is a routine acquisition, has the broadest menu in the industry of esoteric toxicology, which is going to become more and more important in things like clinical trials. And I'm sure you've not missed that drug testing in sports and athletics is getting bigger and bigger. So I think we've made all the right choices. I think we haven't been perfect. We've made some -- not every decision has been perfect -- but we made the right choices. We built the right structure. And we're where we need to be to -- when the market returns, we'll be right on the front edge of the wave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So let me just start with just one question around the organic volume. I know that on a per diem basis, organic volumes grew 0.5%. Just that there's a lot of numbers here. So what was the -- on an actual basis, right, as reported, what would've been same store volume?","David P. King","Organic, not taking into account the extra day?","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Correct.","David P. King","Rather than trying to do this math on the phone, why don't we just take this up separately?","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. Okay. So then moving onto my next question, when you think about the headwinds around Medicare reimbursement next year, I think that based on the math that you provided us, and Street numbers, it's going to cost you about 3% in growth next year. So can you talk about how you plan to offset? And I think it's built a little bit on the prior question. But really, how will you offset this headwind around reimbursement next year on the operational side? That's first. And then second, if you can give us an update just on your capital deployment strategy? I know we talked in the past about coming back to us with your plans around dividends versus buyback by year end.","David P. King","Yes. There isn't any really good way to offset $0.22 in earnings, especially when it's all price-driven because remember, it's just a -- it's a flat reduction to the clinical lab and the physician fee schedule. If it all happens, and this assumes that sequestration happens, I think the 2.75% is in the books, and that's not going to change unless Congress does something else. But if you assume both sequestration and the 2.75%, you get about $0.22 of earnings loss. And being realistic, I mean there's not a lot we can do to offset that. We've got some favorable pricing coming from other managed care contracts. We have some things that we can do on the cost side. But most of that is just -- we've got to manage the business and do the best we can to find expense savings to make up for as much of it as possible. But we're not going to make up for all of it. That's just not realistic. In terms of capital deployment, so far this year, we've returned 82% of our free cash to shareholders through share repurchase, and I feel like we've done a very nice job of that over time. We continue to study the merits of how we would allocate our capital. Obviously, continue to watch the political environment very closely because of tax rate issues that may take effect at the beginning of the year. So we don't have a final decision yet, but in the meantime we're going to continue to do what we have been doing in terms of returning value to the -- returning value and returning our cash to the shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dave, I was wondering if maybe you could just give us some thoughts about how you see the lab industry post reform. There's a lot of questions about what the Affordable Care Organizations will look like and where lab testing will be done. I know you talked a lot about physicians already being owned by hospitals. But can you just talk about 2014 and where you see opportunities and maybe challenges? And then secondly, can you maybe also just size the opportunities around hospital reference labs and where do you -- how big of an opportunity do you think that is? And is there any way to quantify the number of opportunities over the next couple of years?","David P. King","Okay. I think it's too early to predict what 2014 is going to look like, Lisa. And I'm not trying to be elusive. But I think there's no -- at least from what I've seen and from what we've experienced so far with ACOs, there's very little commonality in the way that they're organized, in the way that they're structured, in their affiliations with health systems and so I think it'd be very hard to make a broad prediction about how ACOs are going to work in conjunction with labs. I think, and I won't repeat the discussion earlier on health systems and integrated delivery networks -- the need to reduce cost across-the-board. But I think that the low-cost opportunity and the low-cost -- that the low-cost providers will have great opportunity in whatever environment health care reform ends up looking like. The other side of that is a lot of the 2014 calculations are premised on a sizable population moving into Medicaid. That's premised on Medicaid expansion, and it's not clear that Medicaid expansion is going to occur or that it's affordable. So I just think 2014 remains a large question mark at this point.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then if we think, though, about hospital reference labs and we think about the opportunity to work together, is there any way to size that opportunity for us to say, okay, yes, there's challenges over the next couple of years, reimbursement, et cetera, but there's x percent that you think out in the marketplace you could have a relationship with or work together to be able to replace some of that revenue and increase volume to offset some of the pressure on reimbursement? Is there a way for us to all think about that?","David P. King","Yes. I think there's a lot of numbers out there about how much volume is going through hospitals, how much of it is reference work versus work that has to be done in the hospitals. I guess, the numbers that I -- the single number that to me demonstrates the size of this opportunity is that according to the Medicare Trustees Report, just for Medicare, which is paid to hospitals at basically the same fee schedule that we get paid, just for Medicare, in the last Medicare Trustees Report, there was over $5 billion of lab work that went through hospitals, not in the DRG, not in Part A but just outpatient lab work that was paid off the clinical lab fee schedule that went through hospitals. So there's no revenue compression in that opportunity. There's no premium pricing for hospitals. That's just what hospitals are getting in Medicare from Medicare beneficiaries that could be redirected to independent labs, that could partially be redirected toward independent labs, there could be joint ventures around. And remember, that's where the cost differential was most noticeable to the health systems because they're not getting premium reimbursement. They're not getting multiples of what independent labs are getting reimbursed. So there's no number that I can give you that says this is what we can gain in the next 3 years or this is what we can -- this is what we'll be able to redirect. But that's number you can look at and say there's a lot of volume going through hospitals that could be more efficiently -- that could more efficiently be performed by independent laboratories, and the key is figuring out how to make the hospitals the partner in that endeavor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Sylvia Chao","This is actually Sylvia in for Amanda this morning. I just had a follow-up on your previous comment on HCV, David. I'm curious if you have seen any benefits of that guidance in your volume this quarter. Or how do you expect the overall benefit or impact to your volume in a short term or longer term?","David P. King","I think the HCV opportunity is a longer-term opportunity. We haven't seen anything material certainly in the quarter but the CDC recommendation is that all adults, all U.S. adults in the \"baby boomer\" population be screened. The key will be to get that screening done at the primary care physician point of service because that's where the education needs to take place. The HCV screen is not a hugely expensive test. That's one of the nice things about it. It's a low-cost test that can identify a long-term chronic disease with very negative health consequences. So I think we'll see it migrate into the numbers over the next 3 years. But I don't think you're going to see enormous jumps in HCV screening or HCV utilization in any one particular timeframe.","Sylvia Chao","Okay. Then I just had a follow-on on the next-gen sequencing panel you mentioned earlier. Can you give us a little more color on in terms of what PC types or are you platform-agnostic at this point and do you have a preference for desktop or large box sequencers out there?","David P. King","At this point, we're platform-agnostic, and I think the determination of is it desktop or large box sequencer depends on the model and the volume expectations. So we've actually owned a sequencing business for quite a few years now that specifically develops sequencing panels around cardiovascular disease that was built on a big box model. But I think cardiovascular, I think obviously prenatal genetics and oncology are the 3 biggest markets where we would look at the sequencing methodology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First of all, could you provide any color behind what was behind the lower cash flow guidance? I think in the prepared remarks you talked about the cash receipts being lower this quarter but recovering in Q4. Just wondering also what was behind that?","William B. Hayes","Yes. Kevin, this is Brad. And it really goes back to the discussion we had earlier, I think near the beginning of the Q&A around the top line. So I mean, the cash flow generation, I think, starts with, and the reduction in our guidance, the numbers we've talked about, about our revenue guidance now being 2.5% with a point of that being MEDTOX's. So that's below our Q2 revenue guidance, which excluded MEDTOX. We had not closed at that time. So it starts there, and acquisitions don't contribute immediately the same kind of cash flow that our regular business does. So I think that's the first and foremost thing behind the cash flow revision.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Appreciate that. And then what about the cash receipts? Was that the...","William B. Hayes","Oh, sorry. Yes, that was definitely a highlight for the quarter. And as I said, we expect that to turn around in the fourth quarter.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, Dave, adjusted operating income's been steadily declining this year, obviously a challenging environment. Just -- you guys have done a great job over the years in cutting costs. Just wondering what can be done as we head into 2013. It sounds like you're thinking it's going to be another tough year.","David P. King","Yes. Kevin, I think that -- in some sense goes back to the question Bob asked about how we feel about the long term. So if we believed that we're going to be in a 2% world forever, then looking at geographic -- looking at lab footprint and other things would be very, very high on the agenda versus if you believe you're going to return to growth. You can cut yourself to the point where you're not ready to grow when the market returns to growth. Given that, however, and given the general environment, I mean, we are basically reviewing every dollar of expense that we spend around here and where there are opportunities for us, and that includes, as I think I've said often, our 3 biggest expenses are labor, supplies and breadth. So when you start looking at the expense base, it's facilities, it's people and it's the efficiency of your testing operation. And we're spending a lot of time looking at things that we can do to improve the cost structure without a negative impact on customer service. Again, for all the things we've done from a cost perspective over the last 3 or 4 years, we watch the customer service ratings very carefully. And our customer service ratings that we've just received for the last quarter continue to be at all-time highs for the company. So the last thing we want to do is cause a deterioration in service, which is only going to lead to further deterioration in our growth.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Exactly. Okay. And then we've seen a lot of or heard a lot from the payors about narrower network use. And then you guys are obviously the low-cost provider. Just wondering if you've seen or do you think there will be increased activity or movement by state Medicaid programs shifting to more exclusive arrangements with low-cost providers such as yourself?","David P. King","I guess if I were to identify what I think is the biggest trend in state Medicaid, it's managed Medicaid, so it's moving completely away from the idea that the states are going to run these programs and moving them instead into programs that are run by private companies. And it wouldn't surprise -- I mean again, there you're negotiating with a private insurance company just the way you are when you're negotiating a health system -- sorry, when you're negotiating a standard contract. I wouldn't be surprised to see that continue. Medicaid is not a -- does not pay particularly high rates, Kevin. And they pay -- there is no premium -- there is sort of no in-network -- out-of-network. There's no premium for people who are out of network the way there are with some of the managed care plans. SO I don't know about narrower network so much as I think about ways in which they can just reduce the overall unit cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Dana Vartabedian - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Dana Vartabedian in for Darren. Can you comment on whether or not you've experienced any sort of pricing pressure in anatomic pathology, I guess, especially as it relates to prostate? And if you can, about how much of your pathology business does prostate represent?","David P. King","I don't think we've experienced pricing pressure. As we've talked about historically, the physician in-sourcing has been volume pressured. But I don't think we've experienced pricing pressure and nothing specific with respect to prostate biopsies, no.","Dana Vartabedian - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. And can you tell me about how much of the pathology business that makes up?","David P. King","I could not tell you off the top of my head, sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A few quick questions. Brad, this is, I guess, the third year in a row where that 3Q tax rate is kind of lower than the other quarter. So obviously, that's starting to look like pretty recurring. Would that be your expectation for 2013 as well?","William B. Hayes","Yes.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And that's just seasonal state or...","William B. Hayes","Well, yes, Gary, and it really goes back to, without getting into a lot of discussion about accounting, the adoption of FIN 48 which was several years ago. It really has led to your observation.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then you guys commented that both MEDTOX and histology were the drivers of the negative aggregate revenue per requisition. Can you quantify the MEDTOX impact on that?","David P. King","No. We're just not going to break it down in that level of detail. MEDTOX because of a lot of the routine toxicology testing, employer drug testing, is a lower price point than our average price point, and that's why it created some drag.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And you'd said -- what about on margin, you'd said 50 basis points. I'm sorry, actually you said 50 basis points from the 1 less revenue per day, but you also called out MEDTOX has an impact on year-over-year margin. Can you quantify that?","David P. King","No.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, I'm striking out here.","David P. King","1 of 3. You're still at the Hall of Fame numbers.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, that was just a yes or no question. So this last one will put me either at 250 or at the 500, I guess. I'm going to ask you the question that investors ask me the most. I know it's something that you've given some ongoing consideration to. But given the environment and the lower growth rates, one of the compelling characteristics of the business is the robust free cash flow generation and so over and over again, investors say why not a dividend? And I guess, most people would understand that the pros of giving a dividend and some of the premium valuation that's afforded the stocks that have one. Is there -- what's the obvious stuff on the counter side to why not to institute a dividend in the future?","David P. King","Well, I mean, I think you can make a convincing argument for both sides, and that's why it's not an easy answer. If it were an easy answer, it would be -- we would've answered a long time ago. I think if I think about the reasons why one would not pay a dividend, first of all, we look back to the last -- just 2008, we look back at our share repurchase and the stock is up about $20 so about 30% since the beginning of 2008. And the delta between what we've paid for the shares and the current price or the price as of the beginning of the week was another 15%. I think on a 5-year timeframe, that's a pretty impressive performance for return to shareholders based on share repurchase. And I'm not sure that you add much to that type of performance by paying a dividend. And I think that's the issue is the long-term. If you look at the last year, the last 2 years and where the stock has been, obviously you can make an easy case to say, well, you would have gotten more total shareholder return out of the dividend. But our job is to look at what's in the long-term best interest of our company and our shareholders, and it's just not self-evident that companies that pay a dividend actually maintain premium pricing over time versus share repurchase or that they end up providing a greater level of return to their shareholders than companies that use share repurchase. So those are the considerations. And again, if this were a slam dunk, we would've done it a long -- we would've made our decision a long time ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie Securities.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","I guess the first question is, you said that because of one fewer revenue day, you had a 50 basis points operating margin impact. Is that in line with the benefit that you saw in the first quarter given the extra day and due to the leap year? Or I'm just trying to reconcile that I guess, so any color would be helpful.","William B. Hayes","Dane, if I go back to our first quarter comments, I think we said that days were approximately the same as Q1 '11.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Right.","William B. Hayes","This is revenue days as opposed to calendar days so it's just how many days of revenue do you generate and the fact that there was a leap day in the first quarter doesn't necessarily lead to an additional revenue day because if you look back at the first quarter transcript, obviously, we covered this where the holidays fall and where the January 1 holiday fell this year make a difference in terms of revenue days.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Got it. Okay. So a kind of macro question here, is something that we haven't touched on yet. But looking at the past 3 years or the last 2 years specifically, '11 and year-to-date this year, it's clear that there seems to be an underlying trend of lower macro utilization and we've spoken about unemployment, but something that we get a lot of questions about is around the consumer-driven health plans impacting just lower macro utilization and consumers just avoiding or being more conscientious about the testing that's done in the physician office. I'm just curious if there was any data points that you had that you either confirm, deny or shed some light onto this trend as under current healthcare law or under the health care reform, it seems like this trend is going to continue for some years as it relates back to the Cadillac tax that corporations are trying to avoid. So I'm not sure if you have any data points, but it would be helpful.","David P. King","I think the biggest data point we have is that the percentage of our billings that end up being the responsibility of the patient continue to increase and they particularly continue to increase in the first and second quarters of the year. So it's clear that consumer-driven health plans are causing patients to have more responsibility. It's clear that consumer-driven health plans are dampening utilization. Just hard to point to a statistic, but just anecdotally. I mean, if you look at the Kaiser Family Foundation studies on patients, people who were surveyed who have decided to forego care, that's a pretty compelling statistic about what the consumer-driven health plans are doing. I do think as we get to the next phase of the consumer-driven health plans, which is pricing transparency for patients, again, the lower cost, more efficient providers are going to benefit, and that's where we'll be in an excellent position.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one follow-up question on volumes. Just wondering if you could comment on the pacing throughout the quarter, did it improve or decline when you adjust for seasonality?","David P. King","We don't talk about the pacing of volume within the quarter.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the Foundation Medicine investment, it's interesting technology, obviously, same timeframe and amount of uncertainty about how these tests are going to be regulated over time. So just wondering what your expectations are for how the regulatory and reimbursement process will evolve in that market in 2013.","David P. King","I think -- I don't think you'll see a lot of activity in regulatory or reimbursement with Foundation in 2013. And obviously, we're passive investors, so we're not running that business. But the reason that we invested in Foundation is because we like the technology, we like the leadership, we like the other investors and we think it has the potential to be where cancer diagnostics goes, particularly complex diagnostics, over time. So it gives us a good opportunity to get a look at how cancer diagnostics is evolving without having to make huge capital commitments within LabCorp. And that's the reason why we made that investment and look forward to seeing it evolve over time.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe if I can be a little more specific not just on Foundation but in the category of genetic testing in general, you have obviously a lot of changes being proposed through CMS and some of the parties with whom they work. Just wondering, again, in general, if you look at genetic testing as a category, do you have a specific view on how that market will evolve? I mean, that's obviously a source of potential upside just given the contribution of those types of tests to your business, that's why I asked.","David P. King","Yes, I mean the market clearly is going to evolve toward more genetic testing through a sequencing platform, which means that there's going to be considerable amount more information provided at a lower cost. And part of the challenge is going to be the interpretation of that information by physicians who are delivering services. But I'd just point you toward, I think it was within the last 3 weeks, there was an extensive article in the Wall Street Journal about the genetic research that's being done on autism and the sequencing methodology for the different academic institutions that are using sequencing methodology to try to get at the genetic as opposed to the environmental basis of autism. There's -- this is going to be an area that's going to continue to grow. The sequencing methodology is going to continue to grow. We've invested in it directly in our business but we also will continue investing in it through partners.","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, I think we're going to wrap it up for this morning.

These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set-forth in detail in our 2014 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","Dave King","Thank you, Paul. When we announced the acquisition of Covance, we said that the timing was excellent because the lab business was showing strength after a couple of very challenging years from a regulatory and reimbursement perspective. The acquisition would provide us with new opportunities in an industry that is closely adjacent to ours and the combined capabilities of our businesses would provide exciting new opportunities for long-term revenue and profit growth. Our operating performance in the first quarter in my judgment demonstrates the wisdom of our decision to make this transformational move.","First, LabCorp Diagnostics delivered an exceptional quarter. Pro forma net revenue increased 4.9% over last year to 1.5 billion, despite 30 million lost due to weather during the quarter. Organic volume was a very strong 5.2%. Pricing was relatively stable with revenue per requisition declining a modest 60 basis points, mostly attributable to mix. LabCorp Diagnostic's s strong revenue growth leveraged its operating income growth. Pro forma adjusted operating income now excluding amortization increased 150 basis points over the first quarter of 2014 to 20.2% of net revenue or 18.9% including amortization.","The business benefited from excellent expense control and improvement in productivity driven largely by Project LaunchPad, which includes a number of projects that target procurement, bad debt, service delivery at our patient service centers and revenue cycle management to improve the experience of everyone involved in our clinical diagnostics value chain. LaunchPad is progressing well and we are on-track to deliver 50 million of net savings in 2015.","Second, the Covance project development segment reported strong full quarter net orders of $855 million generating a very impressive book-to-bill ratio of 1.37. Revenue growth for the full quarter on a constant currency basis increased 2.2% over last year, with strong performance from the early development business, partially offset by unfavorable mix in central labs. Although our growth rate was more than expected we achieved record orders for the quarter positioning us for improved revenue performance overtime. In addition, Covance drug development is on-track to deliver cost synergies in 2015 of approximately 35 million.","Third, we continue to see examples of clients coming to LabCorp for the power of our combined businesses. As a reminder, we expect to drive more than $300 million in incremental annual revenue by 2018 through accelerated clinical trial enrollment, end-to-end capabilities and companion diagnostics and combined infrastructure that will improve real world trials. Client continue to express interest in the utility of our unique patient data to deliver fast and efficient patient enrollment, as well as enhanced study and feasibility plans. We have a specific example of the power of our data to help win a clinical study on our fourth quarter call. Since then we've had several examples of using LabCorp data to assist us in winning business. One example I would like to highlight is a request for proposal from a biotechnology company to conduct a late-stage trial with an experimental antibiotic in patients with serious life threatening staph infections including MRSA.","These infections are increasingly resistant to establish treatments. If successful the results would be submitted to the U.S. FDA for accelerated approval of the antibiotic under new guidelines designed to strengthen the countries stockpile of affective antibiotic and anti-microbial agents. Using our combined data set we were able to generate a geographic heat map that visually depicted where we had a match to the trial criteria. The client awarded the project to Covance and the trial would be enrolling for the next 18 months. The data will be used to target known areas with an increased prevalence of the underlying infection which can go a long way in speeding study start-up, one of the most time intensive aspects of running a clinical trial. If the study is successful Covance and LabCorp will have helped a client get a new treatment against deadly infections to doctors and patients sooner meeting an important medical need and vividly demonstrating how only months after the merger we are already capitalizing on the promise of our combined company.","Furthermore, several customers of LabCorp\u2019s legacy bio-analytical laboratory Tandem recently awarded multiple components of early R&D projects to us, rather than their past practice of using CROs for bio-analytical toxicology and other chemistry services. The broader more comprehensive platform that we have as a result of the acquisition provides our customers a one-stop-shop in their efforts to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of drug development. These are examples of the opportunities for revenue and profit growth that we are uniquely positioned to deliver as the world's leading healthcare diagnostics company.","I would now like to provide an update on recent regulatory and reimbursement developments. First, the passage of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 removes the overhang for potential payment reductions that have been implemented in prior years to pay for the legislated decision to suspend the impact of the sustainable growth rate adjustment to the physician fee schedule, also known as the doc fix. This is a positive development for the clinical laboratory industry and we commend congress and the administration for a constructive solution to a problem that has vexed the Medicare system and those of us who provide care for the Nation\u2019s elderly patients for many years.","Second, we await CMS\u2019 preliminary rule on its methodology underlying the market-wide survey proposed in the PAMA legislation. The congressional attempt was clear that this analysis should encompass independent and hospital laboratories to appropriately determine market rates. We have met on multiple occasions with CMS to discuss a practical approach to gathering the survey data and we appreciate CMS\u2019 thoughtful consideration of this extremely complex task. Third, we continue to express our disagreement with FDA\u2019s draft guidance on laboratory developed tests. This unnecessary regulatory burden will increase costs and slow innovation in laboratory medicine and will be terribly harmful to patient care. As always, we are engaged in dialogue with CMS, the FDA, members of congress, ACLA and other stakeholders on all of these matters. Our goal is to protect patient interests, secure reimbursement of medically necessary tests and enable innovation in laboratory medicine.","Finally, I'm pleased to update you on our progress in expanding our capabilities to change the way care is delivered. We are doing this through the development and commercialization of technology-enabled solutions and we now have two services in play. The BeaconLBS team achieved its goal of full implementation earlier this month. BeaconLBS\u2019 technology-enabled solutions are modernizing healthcare by conveniently incorporating laboratory decision support into provider workflow and we will continue to enhance LBS overtime to provide broader physician decision support, as well as timely feedback to physicians about their test ordering patterns and patient compliance with the tests they have ordered. This innovation promotes the use of the appropriate test for the appropriate patient at the appropriate time to enhance care and improve outcomes. I want to commend the entire BeaconLBS team on their unstinting efforts to introduce this innovation into clinical practice.","Enlighten Health is expanding by combining our informatics and analytics capabilities to support our revenue growth opportunities. Enlighten Health is the second cornerstone of our strategy to create technology-enabled solutions for our customers, which will add to our extensive suite of services in both clinical diagnostics and drug development. We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead for both of these businesses. This is an exciting time for our company and our 48,000 employees around the world. I deeply appreciate their hard work in growing the business, executing flawlessly through the closing of the Covance acquisition and fulfilling our mission of improving lives and improving health. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities for our company and expect to continue to deliver profitable growth and create value for shareholders for many years to come.","Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with the review of our consolidated first quarter results followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance drug development segments and conclude with an update on our 2015 guidance. The following consolidated results include Covance as of February 19, 2015. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, an increase of 24% over last year. The acquisition of Covance contributed 267 million from the date of closing, driving 19% year-over-year revenue growth with the other 5% primarily due to strong organic volume across both core and esoteric testing.","Gross profit for the quarter was $596 million or 33.6% of revenue. This compares to 517 million or 36.1% last year. Excluding $33 million of one-time acquisition-related costs gross profit was $629 million or 35.5% of revenue. The increase in gross profit dollars was due primarily to the acquisition of Covance, as well as organic volume and productivity. Excluding Covance gross margin would have been 36.9%, an increase of 80 basis points over last year. SG&A for the quarter was $415 million or 23.4% of revenue compared to 285 million or 19.9% last year. Excluding special charges of $87 million related to the acquisition of Covance and Project LaunchPad, SG&A in the quarter was $328 million or 18.5% of revenue, 140 basis point reduction versus last year.","The increase in SG&A was due primarily to the acquisition of Covance and labor inflation. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue was due to the impact of the Covance acquisition, as well as tight expense controls and a reduction in our bad debt rate. Excluding Covance SG&A as a percentage of revenue would have been 19.3% an improvement of 60 basis points over last year. During the quarter, we recorded $139 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily relating to the Covance acquisition. Amortization expense for the quarter was $31 million up from 21 million a year ago due to the acquisition.","Operating income for the quarter was $130 million or 7.3% of revenue compared to 203 million or 14.2% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $170 million adjusted operating income was 300 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to 232 million or 16.2% last year. Beginning with this quarter we are excluding amortization from adjusted operating income to be consistent with our calculation of adjusted EPS. The exclusion of amortization benefited operating income margin in the quarter by 1.8% compared to 1.5% last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $104 million compared to 26 million last year. The increase was primarily driven by non-recurring acquisition-related items of $53 million and higher debt balances to fund the acquisition.","The tax rate for the quarter was 96.7%, higher than last year's 39.5% rate due to the tax treatment of one-time acquisition-related charges. Excluding these charges the effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.8%. The decline in the tax rate from a year ago was driven by the mix impact of Covance which has a greater percentage of its earnings from lower tax rate foreign jurisdictions than our base business.","Net earnings for the quarter were negatively impacted by restructuring and special items of 141 million after tax, as a result net earnings for the quarter were $1 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared to 113 million or $1.31 per diluted share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items adjusted EPS were $1.73 in the quarter, up 15% from $1.51 last year. During the quarter operating cash flow was negative $87 million compared to $142 million last year as we incurred approximately $154 million of one-time charges relating to the acquisition of Covance, excluding these items operating cash flow was $67 million. The decline in cash flow was due to Covance's seasonal use of cash, partially offset by improved earnings and working capital in our base business.","Capital expenditures totaled $34 million compared to 56 million last year as a result free cash flow was negative $121 million compared to 86 million last year, excluding acquisition-related nonrecurring items, free cash flow for the quarter was $33 million. At quarter-end our cash balance was $446 million during the quarter we raised $3.9 billion in debt to fund the Covance acquisition at a blended interest rate of approximately 3.2% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 12 years. Total debt at quarter-end was approximately $6.9 billion. Our liquidity at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion consisting of cash in unutilized credit.","We now manage and report as two operating segments LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development. Segment results are presented on a pro forma basis for all periods, as of the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2014 and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Segment definitions and reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.","First I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Pro forma revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 4.9% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of volume measured by requisitions and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by price mix and currency. The increase in net revenue of 4.9% includes unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.7% and a decrease in revenue per requisition of 0.6%. Total volume measured by requisitions increased by 6% of which organic volume was 5.2% and acquisition volume was 0.8%.","LabCorp Diagnostics\u2019 pro forma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $300 million or 20.2% of revenue. Compared to 265 million or 18.7% of revenue last year including amortization, margins would have been 18.9% versus 17.3% last year. The increase was primarily due to strong volume growth and productivity, partially offset by pricing mix. Improvement in productivity was driven by labor efficiency and our project LaunchPad initiative which delivered approximately $10 million in savings in the quarter. These benefits included procurement savings, bad debt rate reduction and headcount. We remain on-track to deliver approximately $50 million of LaunchPad savings in 2015.","Now I'll discuss the performance of Covance Drug Development. Pro forma revenue for the quarter was $625 million, a decrease of 1.9% from 637 million last year. The strengthening U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 410 basis points. On a constant currency basis revenue increased to 2.2% over last year on increased volume partially offset by business mix. Pro forma adjusted operating income was $72 million or 11.6% of revenue compared to 77 million or 12.1% last year. The decline in operating margin reflects the impact of currency and unfavorable mix, partially offset by increased volume. Changes in mix resulted from stronger growth in the early development business and lower revenue per kit in essential lab business. Operating income benefited from approximately $5 million of cost synergies relating to the integration of Covance. We are on-track to deliver cost synergies in 2015 of approximately $35 million.","Net orders during the quarter were 155 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.37. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $6.4 billion. This figure reflects the change in methodology from how Covance accounted for its backlogs historically. We have excluded committed minimum volume backlog that is not yet associated with specific project awards. In addition we've adjusted the backlog to reflect the segments current configuration. A reconciliation of beginning to ending backlog is included in our current report filed today on Form 8-K.","Now I'll comment on our 2015 guidance. We expect revenue growth of 39% to 42% inclusive of Covance as of February 19th after the impact of approximately 230 basis points of negative currency. We've assumed that the foreign exchange rates stay at March 31, 2015 levels for the remainder of the year, resulting in an additional 70 basis points headwind versus our previous guidance which used rates as of January 31st. We expect LabCorp Diagnostics to grow 3% to 5% in 2015, after the impact of approximately 70 basis points of negative currency. Covance Drug Development is expected to grow 0% to 2% versus full year 2014 after the impact of approximately 440 basis points of negative currency. The lower guidance for Covance reflects an additional 110 basis point headwind from currency versus prior guidance, as well as unfavorable mix in the central lab business and lower than expected revenue conversion in the clinical business.","We expect 2015 adjusted EPS of $7.55 to $7.90 compared to $6.80 last year. We estimate approximately 100 million total weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2015. Operating cash flow in 2015 is expected to be 1.045 billion to 1.07 billion. Capital expenditures of 325 million to 350 million and free cash flow of 695 million to 745 million. Operating and free cash flow estimates are reduced by approximately $120 million of net non-recurring items related to the Covance acquisition. These items include advisory fees, the makewhole payment on Covance\u2019s notes and change in control payments partially offset by paying only one of the semi-annual interest payments on the acquisition debt in 2015. The $30 million reduction in operating and free cash flow from prior guidance is due to a reclassification which increased acquisition-related charges and decreased the acquisition cash purchase price. Excluding the net non-recurring items we expect free cash flow to be 815 million to 855 million unchanged from our prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks and we\u2019ll now take questions, operator? Operator, we\u2019ll now take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby","The one-time cash needs for Covance for the year were about 30 million from the initial estimate what drove that?","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. Robert this is Glenn it's effectively a reclassification, what we had assumed at the time we announced our deal and provided the guidance as you know was kind of the day after closing was we had to assume how much was going to be the purchase price and cash for the value of the business and then the subsequent events of one-time deal-related advisory CIC and so forth. 30 million that we assumed would be part of the purchase price based upon the accounting would now be treated as cash from operating activities so effectively what we've done is we\u2019ve increased or decreased cash from operating activities by about 30 million, decreased the purchase price cash that we paid for the acquisition so from a cash standpoint there is no change, so when you look at free cash flow though we obviously have to -- and you gave that 30 million but again effectively when you exclude the deal-related our free cash flow excluding one-time deal-related is the same as what we\u2019ve provided as guidance when we established it back in February.","Robert Willoughby","And we have Project LaunchPad cost and what you are going to spend to achieve the Covance deal synergies, do you have any target for the other restructuring expense for the year that was still tracking a higher level?","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes I\u2019d say for the most part all of the, I\u2019ll call it deal-related charges were done in the first quarter, the only difference will be some additional CIC payments that would be paid out as people would potentially exit the company if they were part of the synergies. The other restructuring if you will, will continue to be as we execute and implement our Project LaunchPad, primarily there is some advisory fees in that but that will start to go away and then it really will be just the cost associated with executing on those programs so whether it would be facility rationalization, headcount reduction and so forth there will be some additional one-time charges as we\u2019ve told you before what we've also done is when we provide savings from effectively whether it's Covance synergies or LaunchPad savings we do it on a net basis relative to ongoing cost that would be needed to support those savings, so for example if we implement a new systems to support a LaunchPad initiative the ongoing depreciation or additional cost would be netted out of those savings.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Gill","As I look at the guidance for Covance going forward it looks like the expectation is from here that the trend is going to get better so one Glenn am I looking at that correctly and then secondly Dave when you talk the most recent biotech opportunity, last quarter if I remember correctly Joe had quantified the size of it, are you comfortable quantifying the size of what you talked about today?","Dave King","Lisa, it's Dave. Unfortunately I don't have the size of the opportunity I just got the information shortly before the call this morning, so let us reflect on that and then we can deal with it after the call.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes the only thing I\u2019d add Lisa too and ask Joe if he wants to add color to it as that Covance is expected to see continued improvement as it progresses sequentially throughout the year again the only caveat obviously would be the potential impact of currency where we\u2019re assuming that that's flat and not only do we expect to see improved revenue growth sequentially throughout the year in the business, by what the benefit of the synergy capture that we expect we should be able to leverage those incremental sales very well.","Joe Herring","The revenue opportunity is in the range of 10 million.","Lisa Gill","In the range of $10 million, okay. And then just lastly as we look at this and we look at the results incredibly strong Dave as you talked about in LabCorp but can you give us any more color around that 5% organic I know you said both core and esoteric growing but can you talk about may be what some of the key trends for around that growth in the quarter and substantially better than what we're seeing kind of across the industry?","Dave King","Yes. I'll make a couple of comments and then I'll ask Jay who runs the business if he wants to add anything. First of all, obviously it's a one of the strongest quarters we've had in recent years and so I want to give credit to our senior operating team, our leadership and everyone of the 36,000 up and down from top to bottom who have made it possible, it\u2019s just a tremendous effort in maintaining the quality of service and the quality of our work as the volume increases, so kudos to the entire leadership team. We won some business last year, we won a couple of significant contracts and those absolutely have helped us in terms of volume growth and just to focus expectations for the latter part of the year those will be annualizing by the end of the second quarter so obviously we will see a once those annualize you will see a little bit different volume growth characteristics but 5.2% organic volume is just an outstanding performance and I am very proud of the team for that. Jay?","Jay Boyle","Thank you, Dave and thank you Lisa for noting that. Dave kind of hit on some of the things that I would have talked about, he talked about our people and I think it really does start there. We have just an outstanding salesforce, we have outstanding senior leadership and the thing that I'm pleased about is as you can imagine there is a lot of excitement around this business right now and the opportunities that we have in front of us with the acquisition of Covance and it was important that our people stayed focused on growing the business which is what they have done. In addition to that we have some outstanding relationships with our managed care partners and we\u2019re seeing growth across the board in both the esoteric and the core business, but particularly in our managed care sector and our hospital reference business because of the contracts and the awards that we won Dave alluded to earlier so we\u2019re really pleased and as Dave mentioned we\u2019re going to continue, we expect to continue to grow our volume we\u2019ll have tougher comps as we head through the back half of this year but we look forward to continued good performances and thank you for noticing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Gary Lieberman","Is it possible for you to quantify the impact of the new business as it annualizes in the second quarter and the rest of the year organic volume growth?","Dave King","Gary. It's Dave. Generally as you know we don't breakout specific contributions to volume and revenue growth other than at a high level as we have with volume growth price impact and currency so I would say the answer to your question is no, it's possible but we\u2019re not going to do it.","Gary Lieberman","The organic volume growth benefit in any way from Covance I thought you might have mentioned that there were some testing that shifted over to LabCorp?","Glenn Eisenberg","No I\u2019d say by definition organic we've excluded all acquisition-related volume from that we have said and as I guess Dave alluded to earlier that the organic growth was 5.2% in the diagnostic side we did share with you that an acquisitions contributed an additional 0.8 from the volume that we would have done from those acquisitions but organic is excluding it.","Gary Lieberman","And then may be going back to the comments on the biotech win you mentioned that you created a heat map to sort of figure out I guess geographically where the patients were, what's the dynamic in terms of reaching the physician who can then reach out to the patient or was that not appropriate in this case?","Dave King","No obviously one of the ways that we support trial recruitment is for patients who have a direct relationship with us we can reach out to them and for patients who we don't have a direct relationship with that is they haven\u2019t signed up for the patient portal or given us an email address or other ways in which we can contact them directly then we go to the physician and we highlight to the physician the opportunity that they have patients who are trial-eligible and would they like to recruit the patients in the trial. Obviously given the acuity of these types of infections one would expect the physician response rate and the patient response rate to be fairly high.","Joe Herring","Yes. This is Joe. I'd like to just add how unique this asset is in the combined company. Keep in mind that Covance is directly connected to 50% of all clinical trial patients in the world and when you add that to longitudinal database of 75 million of LabCorp when you can query both of those extensive databases and use informatics capabilities and data display to show the sponsors where the patients are and then following the appropriate HIPAA guidelines to be able to either contact them directly or through a physician is really an unmatched asset on this planet. And we have a couple of wins in a very short amount of time and we are highly motivated to automate that capability and use it as a real competitive advantage and ultimately that means sponsors get their drugs to market faster which benefits them and ultimately patients get new life saving medications like the one Dave mentioned that attacks, among other infections most of which is very resistant to current therapy, so it's really a win for everybody.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.","Bill Bonello","It looks like a very strong quarter. I wanted to just focus on CRO revenue piece and just have you may be give us a little bit more color besides currency what changed in your thinking in terms of the CRO revenue guidance or the Covance revenue guidance and kind of how that relates or contrasts with the very strong book-to-bill and sort of which numbers are more important to read into?","Dave King","Bill, good morning it\u2019s Dave I am going to make a couple of preliminary comments and then let Joe give you more detail, the first thing I want to highlight is, if you adjust for the impact of currency we are still guiding to 4.4% to 6.4% revenue growth, so that in my view is very strong growth guidance on a year-over-year constant currency basis. As we indicated in the prepared comments, the major impacts were strong growth and early development which mixes us down and reimbursement or price per kit in central labs which also mixes us down from a revenue growth perspective. But the orders and the book-to-bill are extremely impressive and so we feel terrific about the long-term revenue growth opportunity and as has been previously mentioned obviously the guidance implies that revenue growth increases later in the year. So with that, my perspective is we had a lot of currency headwind but the base business, the base Covance business is performing very well and with that I'll turn it over to Joe for further comments.","Joe Herring","Yes first of all for the second consecutive quarter Covance reported record new orders. If you followed us historically we had 12 consecutive quarters where net orders started with a seven and we\u2019ve pushed through 800 million in the fourth quarter and then 855 million in the first quarter and that is right in the middle of announcing the combination of our companies and trying to keep people on-track and keeping them focused so to have record order quarters is pretty impressive. In fact they were so impressive we did an independent market research project where it was blinded and clients said they were actually more inclined to include Covance in the bid list and to consider Covance as combined with LabCorp than even Covance on its own.","When you think about the 855 million in net orders that is overwhelmingly and both central labs and clinical that\u2019s where our orders come and those don\u2019t start producing revenue generally for six to nine, and more like nine to 12 months so there is a little bit of a delayed reaction. In terms of the revenue softness being softer than what we expected, it is overwhelmingly related to central labs and it's personally frustrating for me and the whole Covance team because record orders in the first quarter we had record kits going out the door and so the engine is stoked but for the vagaries of central lab not as many kits have come in so far and the ones that have come in either have revenue per test or geographic or therapeutic mix which is less than what we were expecting.","Keep in mind that for the past 10 years whether you look at a three or five or a 10 year CAGR Covance, central lab grows 10% and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve projected for the year and last year it was much higher than that and this year so far it\u2019s much lower but we are projecting much stronger kits in the second half of the year and that\u2019s what you see in our revenue guidance. Secondary to that was slower than expected conversion of clinical studies, and again that happens from time-to-time but clinical also had greater orders and then that marries off against really strong performances in early development, our market access business and early clinical, so that thrown in the blender with the FX headwind and that\u2019s where we are but again we are optimistic looking forward.","Bill Bonello","That was an awesome explanation and makes us feel much better about the lookout, or the outlook I guess. And just if I can ask one completely unrelated question, Dave, can you give us any thoughts on when BeaconLBS will be expanded to either other payers beyond United or to other markets beyond Florida?","Dave King","Bill. It's our goal to expand BeaconLBS both to additional markets and to additional payors and that's -- we had a number of discussions with additional payors. Obviously we've been live for a relatively short period of time, we got to get some experience under our belt and we\u2019ll look forward to updating you on progress and when those expansions will occur overtime.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cherny with Evercore. Please proceed.","Michael Cherny","So I just want to dive in a little bit more. Joe, you mentioned some of the book-to-bill numbers. You've seen the really strong trends last couple of quarters. As you think about how you make those discussions with some of these biotechs, using maybe the one as an example in terms of the trial that you were pleased with, how are you going to get the proof points out? Will you be able to provide interim data in terms of the way that some of these enrollment processes are going on these trials where you can go out and further prove just how successful it has been on an early basis? Or I guess given that you won't have the proof points of how successful these trials are early on, is it still just the promise of what you can deliver verses maybe necessarily having actual results for how successful this will be?","Joe Herring","Well, first of all, all of our relationships with clients as well as specific study data is contractually confidential and if you look at the history of our company, and frankly our competitors you know we really only make specific comments along those lines when the customer wants to publish the data and it would not surprise me, if these first two studies if they perform as we thought, clients may want to say something about that, they could, I think they're very excited about being able to actually see where the patients are which makes them much more confident that a CRO can enroll the trial on-time or faster. But again it's the clients\u2019 decision on that, not ours.","Michael Cherny","And then just you talked about central lab, you talked a bit about late stage. Can you just give us a little bit more color, as well on early stage and some of the underlying performance there and what you are seeing from both the strengths and potential challenges perspective?","Joe Herring","Well a fundamental sort of canary in the coal mine is biotech funding and you know it's been at a very-very high level and those clients basically help build the capacity for Covance and our major competitors. Secondly, a number of pharma companies are as you well know starting to have better productivity from their pipeline and they're more enthusiastic about investing in R&D and knowing that they're going to get a return on their R&D investments, so some of those are coming back to for. That didn't really happen in the first quarter but the new wins and the forward outlook anticipates pharma at sort of getting back to work I guess I would say. But the strength of the early development business in the industry in total is very encouraging after the last four or five years of less than expected performance.","Operator","The next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Glen Santangelo","Just two quick questions, Dave, wanted to follow up on the Covance margins. If I hear what you are saying correctly on the revenue side, it kind of sounds like there was unfavorable mix and the central lab as being one of the big contributors to the lower-than-expected revenues and is that primarily what explains maybe the slightly weaker-than-expected margins? And if we assume that the trend in central labs reverses itself throughout the balance of the year, should we see that positively impact the margin line in the balance of the year as well?","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes Glen, this Glenn Eisenberg, let me take a first cut and Dave and Joe may want to step in. But to your point during the quarter obviously margins came down but principally due to the impact of currency but also the mix of the business so the benefit was obviously we got some volume benefit as well as the synergy savings. As we project out in the business going forward we do have a more positive outlook, volume is going to continue to improve, hopefully the mix will start to improve and we know we're going to get the synergies to continue to grow so our expectation for the business will be again continued top-line growth as we go throughout the year subject to the currency impact obviously but especially leveraging those sales well.","Glen Santangelo","Maybe if I can just follow-up with one question on the diagnostics side. The pricing, the rev per requisition was down 60 basis points, which seems like another small sequential improvement from where we were trending in fiscal 2014. Dave, maybe could you update us what is going on there and sort of your outlook on lab pricing for the balance of the year?","Dave King","Yes, sure Glen. Obviously the 60 basis points is both a sequential improvement and a significant year-over-year improvement and basically the big driver of the 60 basis points and reported decline is just payor mix so we continue to see uninsured patients moving to exchange or manages Medicaid products and that has a downward impact on the revenue per requisition and so I think we're actually looping our way through that as I see a enrollment completes and stabilizes but that to me is kind of the primary reason and as I say we feel pretty good about it because unit price is not going down what we're seeing is mix-driven price impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda Murphy","Just had a follow-up on the guidance, I think you said 100 million in share count that you expected -- diluted share count -- for this year and maybe that was a slight reduction in what you had said last quarter. I don't know if I am reading too much into that?","Dave King","No Amanda that's correct. That on a fully dilutive weighted average shares count we expect to and our guidance is predicated on a assumption of 100 million shares for the full year.","Amanda Murphy","So then the right way to think about that is $0.20 of increase roughly, $0.15 of that is the share count and so then the base business maybe added $0.05 or more given the increased currency effect, is that fair?","Dave King","That's correct.","Amanda Murphy","And then just another one on the book-to-bill, so I realize it's early and you have made a few comments on this already, and especially some anecdotal evidence of wins, but is there a way to tease out at this point the strong book-to-bill, how much of that is the legacy Covance business and markets doing better vis-\u00e0-vis any benefits from having the combined company together at this point?","Joe Herring","I\u2019ll say it\u2019s overwhelmingly legacy Covance at this time, but again high client interest in talking with us and exploring the assets of the combined company.","Dave King","And Amanda, Dave just a quick exclamation point of that I mean I think Joe made a very important point which is you are going through an acquisition and integration of closing and you have another quarter of record orders and very strong book-to-bill, so I think the important thing to think about is yes it is we agree I agree it\u2019s mostly legacy Covance, but we didn't have a distraction factor in either of the businesses and I am very pleased about that.","Amanda Murphy","And did you give a cancellation rate on the backlog?","Dave King","No we did not.","Amanda Murphy","Okay. All right, thanks very much.","Dave King","Keep in mind that we report net orders so it\u2019s net of cancellations. We normally don't comment on cancellations that's a not a part but I think I would say that they are the lowering of the historical range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Q - Isaac Ro","Just a follow-up on the early-stage business, hoping that you could maybe put a little more color on the specific constant currency growth rate you saw there and maybe give us and apples-to-apples view on how that trended versus 4Q?","Glenn Eisenberg","This is Glenn well let me really start and then Joe may want to provide color. As we've now moved to kind of the new segmentation of the company we are really providing the details if you as the segments. We\u2019re glad to provide color as far as the direction that the businesses that comprise those segments, but we are not providing detailed numbers and growth rates and so forth.","Joe Herring","Yes I think generally what you say is that early development was higher than that company average of 2.2, clinical Phase 1 to four was sort of in that average and central labs was basically flat, so ballparkish on a constant currency basis.","Isaac Ro","I appreciate all that incremental, and then just a follow-up on the general environment. I think if we look at the numbers for the biotech industry, first-quarter funding on the equity side was by far a record quarter, a huge amount of money raised. So if we take in context what is going on with the funding side versus what you guys are seeing book-to-bill, maybe help us reconcile the timing around which we might see any of those bolus dollars kind of flowing through to your business. Appreciate it is going to be company-specific and maybe not directly correlated, but I would assume that it's at least a positive correlation between the amount of money being raised and the amount of money being spent on CROs?","Dave King","Yes there is a positive correlation it\u2019s usually a six to nine month lag between what you see in terms of funding and revenue coming into the CRO industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.","Jack Meehan","I just wanted to follow up on the PAMA commentary and just see if you had an update in terms of when you -- timing for when you expect we will get a formal update and I know, Dave, you mentioned the complexity of collecting data and just thoughts around the hospital labs submitting the data -- they already submit cost reports, so just what is some of the thinking there?","Dave King","Yes. Jack it\u2019s Dave good morning. I think this is a it is a quite complex task and I think CMS is making a real good faith effort to listen to the constituencies and try to understand what they should be looking for. It's true that hospital submit cost reports but as you know the hospital, what we're looking at here is not DRG payments, it's not out patient prospective payments, it's just fee-for-service payments and so it's a subset of payments and it's a subset of payors because it\u2019s non-government payors that the government is interested in looking at to determine market, so it's a pretty complicated task, you don't want to overburden either the hospitals or frankly the independent labs, I mean if you think about the number of acquisitions that we have done and the number of tax ID numbers that we have, you don't want an independent lab to have to report their data with 55 different tax IDs, that would be enormously time consuming and complex, so I think CMS is making an effort to listen to the constituencies and deal with the complexity and come out with a rule and we don\u2019t have any update on the timeline but we know they're working hard and we're trying to be constructive and supportive in that effort.","Jack Meehan","And then just trying to tease out between the routine and the esoteric growth in the quarter, is there any -- was there anything noticeable on the esoteric side in terms of individual products that were driving the growth, or do you think it is just more broad-based -- the market is doing better and the segment is doing better?","Dave King","I think it's broad-based, market doing better and segment doing better I wouldn't point to or highlight any specific test or group of tests. Obviously we continue to do nicely with women's health, that's been a strong point for us, we continue to do nicely with genetics, those are couple of good areas within esoteric.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley, please proceed.","Ricky Goldwasser","Dave, you responded to Glen's question that coverage expansion is impacting the price mix and it sounds like it's coming from Medicaid. So are you seeing any pullthrough volume from coverage expansion, excluding Medicaid, and are you factoring in any benefit from expansion or pick up there in your guidance for the second half?","Dave King","The challenge in determining what is ACA driven other than managed Medicaid where it's pretty obvious is that when a patient shows up with an insurance card we don't know if it's an exchange patient or if it's a standard commercial patient. We don't have any way of determining that so it's a little hard to say are we seeing pull through business from coverage expansion or are we not. Again I think we saw very strong organic volume growth which suggests to me that we're seeing the benefit of the business that we won last year and there are clearly some pull through coming from that business. In terms of what's factored in for the second half of the year actually the next three quarters of the year, we haven't finished the first half of the year, we're not factoring in any significant increase in enrolment for the balance of the year, we're simply factoring in the diagnostics business continuing to do a very nice job in the market in terms of selling and execution and that's what drives the top-line revenue growth guidance.","Ricky Goldwasser","And then one follow-up on the Covance business, can you share with us how you think about the Covance portfolio, especially kind of like the early development, but really preclinical within it? Obviously, demand is high and it seems from results that Covance is growing top line, but how does the segment fit with your long-term strategy?","Dave King","Well, Ricky it's Dave, you know one of the reasons that we liked Covance as an acquisition opportunity is the complete platform and the broad scope of services, so I mentioned in the prepared remarks how the bio-analytical business was cross-selling into toxicology, was cross-selling into chemistry. So right now we like the way all the businesses fit together and we're enthusiastic about the opportunity to grow, early development obviously had as Joe mentioned had some challenges for a couple of years but right now the business is growing strongly, it's an integral part of the complete one stop platform that we built and so we're excited about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed.","A.J. Rice","Maybe two quick questions here, first of all, I know one area in the lab testing that you have highlighted the last two years has been the molecular diagnostic area and some of the travails of trying to get approval out of some Medicaid programs as well as TRICARE. Any update on that?","Dave King","A.J., it's Dave, we continue to work hard at that. I wouldn't expect any significant impact in the run rate either of the -- where MoPath is not being paid for or of collections, we have collected based on appeals and payor policy changes, we have collected some against the outstanding receivables but the run rate's about the same. Obviously we're looking now at accounts and opportunities to where we know that there is an account where there is a large amount of MoPath business that we\u2019re not getting paid for it opportunities to manage better with that and Jay if you have any further comments on that you can.","Jay Boyle","I think you have covered it.","A.J. Rice","And then just the other one is you had mentioned in the prepared remarks about the lab-developed tests and the FDA review there and commentary, any sense of how that is going to unfold timing-wise and when we might actually get some resolution on this?","Dave King","I think the FDA comment period closed I think there were a very large number of comments so it's really going to be determined by the FDA in terms of when they respond to the comments and obviously there is some legislative activity going on as well and we\u2019re doing our best to be engaged in the all of the conversations.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","David Clair","I had a couple quick questions on the diagnostics side of the business here. So the first one, just on the recently issued next-generation sequencing, CPT codes, just curious if LabCorp is billing under these new codes currently and is this impacting collections at all. And then can you give us an update on BRCA and NIPT testing?","Dave King","It's Dave I'll start with next-gen and then Jay will talk about the BRCA and NIPT the next-gen sequencing codes I want to be clear that next-gen sequencing is a methodology so it's not like we're doing new testing or different testing it's simply there is a different methodology being used and so at this point the coding has not have an impact first of all it\u2019s not a significant component of the business at this point, although it will grow but the coding has not had an impact on either revenue or collections and I will turn it over to Jay in terms of the BRCA and the NIPT.","Jay Boyle","Yes on the BRCA David we see it obviously as a growth opportunity however given the size it's not substantial in terms of or it is not material, in terms of our entire book of business and it\u2019s one of the many tests that we go ahead and offer.","Dave King","And it's Dave on NIPT obviously we are -- we have transitioned to offering our own test in pharmacy and I'm pleased with the volume and revenue there and continue to see it as I mentioned as a growth opportunity around women's health.","David Clair","Thank you.","Dave King","So, we're right at the top of the hour we have a couple of more people in the queue I'll ask you to keep the questions short please so we can get everybody in and also not ask questions that have been previously responded to.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Darren Lehrich","Just a brief question I had about companion diagnostics and just wondering if you can frame at this point the backlog in terms of how the trials are with companion diagnostics as a component of that and where you think that might be going. I think you've laid that out as a strategy, so that's the question?","Dave King","Yes. We don't break down the backlog by type of trial companion diagnostics as you know particularly oncology about 40% of the trials involve some kind of an associated biomarker in companion diagnostic and so it's a very nice long-term opportunity for us as I think we mentioned early on there were 16 companion diagnostics 10 years ago and now there is 116 and that number grows every year. We have a work team that is specifically focused on capitalizing other companion diagnostics opportunity and integrating all of our services to be the desired partner in companion diagnostics and we\u2019re very pleased with the progress there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group. Please proceed.","Bryan Brokmeier","You talked about providing a heat map of where patients are located to the biotech company whose business you won in the quarter. It sounds a bit more detailed of an analysis than you provided to the customer in the prior quarter. Are you still improving your understanding of how to present your offering to customers and while you have won a few contracts already, which is impressive, should we anticipate an inflection point later this year when customers start to award you with many more contracts?","Joe Herring","Well. It\u2019s hard to say what is going to happen in the back half of the year all I can say is that we try to target places where this data would make the biggest impact on the client and so far we\u2019re very excited about what's going on. We have a lot of work ahead of us in terms of making the process easier and more efficient and having the right display tools and that type of thing, so I would just say we will continue to talk about this in coming quarters but we\u2019re pleased with the start actually faster than what we would have projected.","Dave King","Yes. I agree with Joe's comments I think that as he said automating this process and making it simple from our perspective and from the client's perspective will only lead to greater opportunity in the long run but as you mentioned Bryan the idea of being able to provide a heat map with potential patients for a condition as acute as this one, I think is a real competitive differentiator and just shows you what the long-term opportunity is here in terms of our first dated priority which is to improve the speed of trial recruitment and reduce the cost of trials.","Operator","I would now turn the call over to Mr. Dave King for closing remarks.","Dave King","Once again we'd like to thank you all for participating in our first quarter conference call. Very pleased with the quarter and with the performance, both from the Diagnostics and the Drug Development business and we look forward to updating you on our performance in the future.

At time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Surdez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Surdez","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's first quarter 2016 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet.","With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Deborah Keller, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","In addition to our press release, we also filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we're making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in our 2015 10-K. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","Dave King","Thank you, Paul and good morning. We had an impressive quarter in which we continued to demonstrate the power of our transformed company through our operating performance and progress on key strategic priorities. First quarter pro forma revenue growth was nearly 9% with strong organic growth in both LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development. This growth coupled with reengineering our business process through project launch pad and capturing additional cost synergies from the Covance acquisition drove another quarter of margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Our excellent first quarter operational performance and business momentum give us confidence to increase our 2016 revenue and PS outlook.","Our ongoing success is due to sustained focus on our mission to improve health and improve lives and execution on our three key strategic initiatives. Being the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and using information to change the way care is delivered. I will now update you on our progress of these strategic guide posts. First we are delivering diagnostic solutions through a combination of enhanced offerings, complementary acquisitions and technological innovation.","We continue to lead an offering of cutting edge testing introducing over 75 new tests to market during the past year. We are increasingly deploying our integrated testing capabilities, industry leading science and innovative technology offerings to establish strategic partnerships with providers. Hospitals, health systems and large physician networks seek us out for our comprehensive capabilities in reference testing, supply chain management, IT and informatics, decision support and clinical trials.","We're also focused on our relationship with managed care organizations, a backbone of our business. We have the strongest managed care portfolio in the industry and are proud of our deep partnerships with these clients. In addition we are increasing our focus on partnering with government and quality government payors as they take on broader roles in developing new payment structures and care models.","Underpinning our core diagnostic strategy is our innovation in data integration and in tools to support enhanced connectivity, reporting and decision support. We differentiate from our competitors by providing these tools as well as the highest quality cost efficient laboratory services to help a wide array of partners as they move to more extensive management of patient health and broader sharing of risk.","We complement our organic growth initiatives with carefully considered acquisitions and partnerships that drive long term profitable growth. During this quarter we invested approximately $100 million in strategic tuck in deals predominantly focused on esoteric testing such as anatomic pathology which provides critical diagnostic information in the determination of the appropriate course of cancer treatment. Looking ahead our acquisition pipeline remains robust and we see attractive opportunities to enhance our test menu and expand our geographic footprint.","In addition to our revenue growth initiatives we are committed to increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience, Project LaunchPad is introducing new tools and systems to reengineer our processes as well as enhance the patient employee and customer experience. With indentified projects underway such as improving our billing system and patient service center workflow, LaunchPad will sustainably reduce costs, benefitting the long-term margins of LabCorp Diagnostics.","We remain on track to deliver $150 million in net savings to the three year period ending in 2017, although LaunchPad is a finite program aimed at process reengineering, we will always have opportunities to drive shareholder value through further productivity and efficiency programs. Our culture of continuous improvement began long before LaunchPad and will remain after we achieve our stated LaunchPad goals. In its second year LaunchPad has transitioned from shorter duration initiatives to system reengineering which entails longer timelines for execution and longer term savings impact.","Our second core objective is bringing innovative medicines to patients faster. We execute that objective by offering unique capabilities and solutions to solve problems for our customers. Inefficiency in the clinical trial, recruitment and startup process persist at the most significant pain-point for our biopharma customers. We are introducing solutions that no other company can replicate to address this challenge. We're commercializing the combination of LabCorp\u2019s proprietary patient data and Covance\u2019s proprietary informatics and investigator database, in support of enhanced study planning as well as improved clinical file placement and recruitment.","During the quarter the use of LabCorp data played a key role in winning a large Phase 3 oncology study, which increased our cumulative orders from use of LabCorp data to over $190 million. We've begun to convert this backlog into revenue and remain on track to deliver $150 million in incremental revenue through 2018. In addition the number of patients that provided consent through our patient portal to be contacted about clinical trials steadily increased throughout the quarter. We believe patients will want to be part of a process that improves the speed at which cutting edge therapeutics are delivered to the market and we're exploring partnerships to expand our reach with this initiative. Overtime we believe that this database will further differentiate our studies startup and recruitment capabilities in support of better drug development.","We continue to develop comprehensive solutions in key therapeutic areas, capitalizing on our unique end-to-end capabilities across all aspects of drug development. The scientific and clinical expertise that Covance Drug Development and LabCorp Diagnostics offer in combination, our combined laboratory expertise, and our ability to deliver all of our services with the highest quality and at scale put us significantly ahead of our competitors. To give you a couple of specifics, our industry leading Central Lab, a product of our combined capabilities, reported another outstanding quarter of double-digit organic revenues growth. We recently introduced automation to our Geneva central lab to improve productivity and expanded it to double capacity, allowing us to better serve the growing demand for our enhanced menu of lab testing in Europe, Africa and around the globe.","Our companion diagnostics franchise continues to thrive and is another excellent example of the power of our combined offering. Companion diagnostics are growing in importance to our customers to help them secure regulatory approval, reimbursement and market adoption for their medicines in an increasingly demanding healthcare system. LabCorp and Covance uniquely offer companion diagnostic capabilities from discovery through commercialization. These capabilities include development, validation, support for in vitro diagnostic kits, ability to responsibly launch laboratory developed diagnostics, market analysis, reimbursement support, lifecycle management and timely commercialization of drugs and their companion diagnostics to our sizable base of providers and their patients.","We see strong revenue growth in companion diagnostic services across many therapeutic areas including oncology, inflammation and central nervous system disorders. We remain confident that we will deliver $100 million in incremental revenue in this area through 2018 and highlight our differentiated capabilities from our competitors.","For our third objective, we are changing the way care is delivered through the use of information and technology enabled solutions. In diagnostics as noted we are expanding our menu of decision support tools and integrated content to assist payors, physicians, health systems and patients, in better understanding and managing medical conditions. We also recently marked the one year anniversary of Beacon LBS's commercial launch and we're pleased with the technology\u2019s clear financial and clinical benefits. In addition, we are seeing increased provider satisfaction with Beacon LBS\u2019s test and lab selection functionality as well as its ease of use. We intend to add new capabilities to Beacon LBS this year and remain optimistic about its introduction in new markets.","In drug development we are enhancing Covance's Accelerate suits of services to enable faster patient enrollment, more efficient site monitoring and improved study planning, Accelerate helps reduce the time and cost of trials by providing an easy to use replicable tool to improve insight into trial site performance and trail success. We will also implement new approaches to lower the patient burden and improve the patient journey through clinical trials. We recently launched the suite of mobile capabilities designed to help biopharmaceutical and technology companies, navigate the rapidly evolving mobile health landscape. Through this novel offering, we will provide regulatory consulting and validation services to help companies certify the accuracy and consistency of mobile devices and applications for use in clinical trials.","Through all of this activity we have been and will be excellent stewards of capital. We have made steady progress in our commitment to delever the balance sheet and we're now at approximately 3.5 times leveraged approaching our target. We continue to deploy capital towards strategic acquisitions and expect to be in a position to return capital to shareholders in the second half of the year. By virtue of our investments in innovation, talent, science, quality, operational excellence and distinctive technology LabCorp is increasingly well positioned to profit from global opportunities across our $200 billion addressable market. I am proud of my colleagues who everyday reflect our core values of excellence, integrity, teamwork, courage, inspiration and ownership that they work tirelessly to improve the health and lives of patients around the globe. Our team's efforts are the reason for our success this quarter and they will continue to be LabCorp's greatest competitive advantage. I thank them for their great work and the results they continue to deliver.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with the review of our first quarter results followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 30% over last year. Covance contributed 24% year-over-year growth due to strong demand as well as the inclusion of a full quarter of results compared to a partial quarter last year. The remainder of the increase of 6% was driven by LabCorp Diagnostic\u2019s strong organic growth and tuck-in acquisitions partially offset by currency. Gross profit for the quarter was $777 million or 33.9% of revenue, compared to 625 million or 35.3% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to strong demand, productivity and acquisitions partially offset by personnel costs. The declining gross margin was primarily due to the mix impact from a full quarter of Covance results. On a pro forma basis, gross margin would have increased 50 basis points over last year.","SG&A for the quarter was $412 million or 17.9% of revenue, compared to 442 million or 25% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $10 million primarily related to the integration of Covance and executive transition expenses, compared to 119 million a year ago, which were primarily related to the acquisition of Covance. Excluding special charges SG&A in the quarter was $402 million or 17.5% of revenue, compared to 322 million or 18.2%. The increase in adjusted SG&A was primarily due to acquisitions, personnel cost and bad debt while the percentage of our SG&A benefited from a full quarter of Covance's lower rate. On a pro forma basis, adjusted SG&A would have improved 10 basis points over last year. During the quarter, we recorded $19 million of restructuring charges primarily relating to the closure of redundant facilities in general integration initiatives. Amortization expense for the quarter was $44 million, up from 31 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions.","Operating income for the quarter was $302 million or 13.2% of revenue compared to 132 million or 7.5% last year. Excluding amortization restructuring in special items of $74 million, adjusted operating income was 376 million or 16.4% of revenue compared to 302 million or 17.1% last year. The decline in margin was primarily due to the mix impact from a full quarter of Covance results. On a pro forma basis adjusted operating margin would have improved 60 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter was $55 million compared to 104 million in the first quarter of 2015, the decrease was due to non-recurring acquisition related items of $53 million reported last year partially offset by higher debt balances following the acquisition of Covance. The tax rate for the quarter was 37.3% excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 36.5% up from 35.4% last year primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings.","For the full year, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be comparable to last year's rate of 35.3%. Net earnings for the quarter were $160 million or $1.55 per diluted share excluding amortization restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.02 in the quarter, up 15% from $1.76 last year. These results included a net gain in the quarter of $0.05 per diluted share on the sale of investment securities from our venture funds. During the quarter our operating cash flow was $123 million compared to negative 87 million in the first quarter of 2015. Last year cash flow was negatively impacted by $154 million of one-time charges relating to the acquisition of Covance. Excluding these charges operating cash flow was up 57 million over last year due primarily to improve earnings.","Capital expenditures totaled $71 million or 3.1% of revenue, up from 34 million or 1.9% last year. Capital expenditures in the quarter were in line with typical spending levels, while last year's CapEx was low due to the delayed spending related to the acquisition and integration of Covance. As a result, free cash flow was $52 million in the first quarter, an increase from 33 million last year, excluding the nonrecurring items. At quarter end our cash balance our cash balance was $696 million compared to 716 million at the end of the 2015. Total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. During the quarter, we invested 97 million in acquisitions, and our leverage declined to 3.5 times debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA.","Now I'll review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are presented on a pro forma basis for all periods, as if the acquisition of Covance closed on January 01, 2015, and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.","Now I will review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 7.2% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of organic volume growth measured by requisitions, Beacon LBS, price mix and tuck-in acquisitions partially offset by currency. The revenue increase includes a benefit from Beacon LBS of 1% and unfavorable currency translation of 0.6%. Revenue per requisition increased 2.7%, benefiting from price mix and tuck-in acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing revenue grew at a faster rate than core testing revenue. Total volume increased by 4%, of which organic volume was 3.4% and acquisition volume was 0.6%. Volume benefited from the impact of weather and the additional day that was partially offset by the timing of the Easter holiday.","LabCorp Diagnostics\u2019 adjusted operating income for the quarter was $310 million, or 19.5% of revenue, compared to 290 million, or 19.5%, last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to volume, price mix and productivity, partially offset by personnel costs and bad debt. Although the operating margin was consistent with last year, it was constrained by the mix impact from Beacon LBS and an increase in the bad debt rate of approximately 25 basis points due to an increase in patient responsibility. For the remainder of the year we\u2019d expect our bad debt rates to improve benefitting from our LaunchPad initiatives. We remain on track to deliver our 150 million LaunchPad savings goal over the three year period ending 2017.","Now, I'll review the performance with Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $703 million, an increase of 12.6% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 160 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi Site Support agreement revenue increased 17.9% over last year. The strong revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central lab businesses. Adjusted operating income was 103 million or 14.7% of revenue compared to 74 million or 11.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to demand, productivity and cost synergies. Partially offset by the expiration of the Sanofi Site Support agreement and personnel costs. We remain on track to achieve our three year 100 million cost savings goal through 2017 related to the acquisition of Covance. Net orders during the quarter were $830 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.18, while backlog at the end of the quarter was $6.9 billion. The trailing 12 month net book-to-bill was also 1.18.","Now, I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes March 31st foreign exchange rates for the remainder of 2016. We expect revenue growth of 8.5 % to 10.5%, after the impact from approximately 40 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% due to strong organic growth and a 60 basis point improvement in currency. We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 4% to 5.5% over 2015, after the impact from approximately 20 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% due to organic growth and a 30 basis point improvement in currency. We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 6% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue, after the impact from approximately 50 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 2% to 5% due to strong organic growth and 150 basis point improvement in currency. Excluding the impact from currency and the exploration of the Sanofi Site Support agreement, we now expect net revenue to increase approximately 9% to 12%.","We expect adjusted EPS of $8.55 to $8.95, which implies growth of 8% to 13% over 2015 and is an increase from our prior guidance of $8.45 to $8.85. As a remainder, our adjusted EPS guidance includes an increase in our share count due to stock compensation and often exercises but does not include any share repurchases. We expect free cash flow of $900 million to $950 million unchanged from our prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks and we will now take questions, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Due to time constraints we are ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up if needed. And our first question comes from Robert Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Willoughby","Dave and Glenn, I am wondering, why maybe not a bit more profit margin leverage on the quarter based on how well the lab volumes as low as revenues for accession trended? And then maybe a quick comment on just the deal pipeline robust is it robust for smaller kinds of tuck-ins or is the focus more on some larger transactions additive to some of your newer platforms?","Glenn Eisenberg","Okay, hi Robert. Let me ahead and this is Glenn, I\u2019ll cover the margin question and then pass over to Dave. First of all, obviously we had good margins overall for the company, at 16.4% margins, we are up around 60 basis points year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. I know your comment was probably more directed to the diagnostic side of the business, where we maintain our 19.5% margins year-over-year. As I commented in our opening remarks, our first quarter was constrained, were not for some of those issues we would have seen margin expansion and really there are three primary reasons. The first is our Beacon LBS business which we had a full quarter this year with none last year, it annualizes actually now beginning into the second quarter, so given that most of it right now is still cash through that was a constrain on our margins.","We also did have bad debt rate increase for the first time, given the high patient responsibility but again as we said we expect that rate to come down going forward through the LaunchPad initiatives. So it won't be a constraint we believe going forward. And then finally, worth noting is that with our merit increase, we did have good merit increase year-over-year that will annualize in July of this year so for the first half, we will see some constraint on the margins from that, but overall at over 7% top-line growth maintaining really strong 19.5% margins, domains our operating grew by over 7% despite those constrains. Dave?","Dave King","Thanks Glenn. Bob, on the acquisition pipeline, I would say the acquisition pipeline is robust across the broadest -- across the whole spectrum. Our focus as evidenced in the quarter is on the tuck-in strategic deals that on the diagnostic side would enhance our geographic footprint or expand our test menu and on the growth development side would provide specific areas either of therapeutic expertise or other assets that would complement our current set of offerings.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Bonello of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","Bill Bonello","So a particularly good looking quarter on the Covance side of the business and overall, just wondering if you would be willing to comment at all at this point with Covance onboard for more than a year now, how you are thinking about growth over the longer period of time? Do you think you can be a sustainable 10% plus EPS grower or do have any kind of internal objectives anything that you can give a color on that front would be great?","Dave King","Good morning Bill it is Dave, thanks for the comments. I think we have a sense of where we think long term revenue growth should be and that\u2019s with the diagnostics business kind of low to mid single-digits and with the Covance business mid to higher single-digits consistently overtime. How that translates to EPS obviously is a function of capital deployment and some other things, so I think you can expect us this year to set some aspirational targets for EPS growth overtime. I think if you look back historically obviously before the major reimbursement cuts of '13 and '14, we had a very nice I believe it was a five year EPS CGAR of 13 plus percent and we had a couple of years of flat to declining EPS simply because of declining pricing and the cuts attended to that. But I think it's an excellent question and as I said I think you can expect us during this year to set out some long term EPS growth expectations that we expect to achieve overtime as these businesses are fully integrated.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Lisa Gill","Dave, can I just follow up on a couple of your comments that you made, just first when you think about the acquisition strategy and you think about how well Covance is doing right now. Can you maybe just give us a little more color as to how we think about the acquisition strategy there, you talked about tuck in more on the diagnostic side but on the drug development side is there areas that you feel that you need to really truly compete in the market and as we think about the better results in the quarter was there something specific that drove that versus your original expectations?","Dave King","In terms of the acquisition strategy specifically for the drug development business what I would say is, there is -- I divide it into two parts. The first part is just continuing to look at for right now the tuck ins and the things that are additive to particular parts of the business that we would like to expand so therapeutic expertise, market access, the areas where we feel that there is an interesting opportunity to either expand capabilities or enhance capabilities with things that would be additive to the overall end to end capabilities of the business. Overtime as we've said, we feel that we need to be larger in the clinical business and some of that will come from organic growth and the initiatives that we have underway and therapeutic expertise and integration with LabCorp Diagnostics. But it's my expectation that some of that will also come from acquisition. I would say that now our focus is not on another sizeable deal, our focus is on complementary capabilities that are additive to what we have. Although obviously we evaluate a lot of things and we're going to look at anything that looks like the right opportunity for us given price multiples and longer term return on invested capital. So that's how I would summarize the acquisition strategy around the Covance business. ","In terms of the performance it's hard to single out any particular area because they all did so well, the business is kicking along extremely well, Deb is doing a great job as CEO and on top of that the leadership moves that she has made have created terrific stability and a sense of purpose in the organization and so I complement everybody at Covance from early development and pre-clinical all the way through clinical for a very strong performance in the quarter just as I complement everybody on the diagnostic side from bottommost to senior executive for a very strong performance there, we just did really, we really executed well on the strategic initiatives and we performed well operationally in the quarter.","Lisa Gill","I would agree congratulations on that nice quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan","I wanted to start with the strength at Covance, I caught some of Glenn\u2019s commentary around Central Lab but I was curious if you stacked up early development and late stage how they fared relative to that or if they were really close in terms of the growth rates in the quarter?","Deborah Keller","Good morning, this is Deb. So I can give you a little more color on that. Early development as Dave said had another strong quarter and the market's been recovering over the past 18 to 24 months and our demand remains strong, utilization in the market is tightening which results in slight price increases, and it has in the last six quarters, so we continue to manage our capacity very efficiently and effectively. As far as Central Labs, we've had fantastic growth, we've had stronger volume and strong demand that's been fuelled by the breadth of assays that we have because of the combination of core end and Covance. We've also seen a nice conversion of the studies that we have in Central Labs, so that's been driving volume. In clinical trials as they get more and more complex the number of esoteric assays are increasing and that allows us to be a one stop shop for our customers, which they tend to value that.","When you look at clinical this is the largest market that we serve and one of the largest opportunities that we have for growth, both for Covance as well as for the combined entity. We had strong results this quarter and you know we continue to invest in talent and tools. In January we added a new sales leader who was previously the head of sales for both Central Labs and early development and then as you know we recently announced that Jonathan Zung has joined, and he brings a wealth of experience in clinical development as well as his perspective from the voice of the client. So these hires, plus our investment in informatics as Dave had talked about earlier and the combined data is going to allow us to address our client's biggest pain points, which is decreasing the time for study start ups, identifying patients and sites. So we're very pleased with the results this quarter.","Jack Meehan","And then maybe just one more on personnel cost, it was mentioned a few times in the prepared remarks, just an area of modest pressure. I was wondering if that was anything incremental that you are seeing and then just what the outlook is for the rest of the year? Thank you.","Glenn Eisenberg","Jack, this is Glenn. On the personnel costs, I think we spoke to just obviously the growth of the business and the people, obviously, that are needed to support the growth. But we also have the additive part of the higher merit that we provided last year, reflective of the performance of the company that will annualize in July, but more just normal growth in the business supporting the higher growth in our personnel costs.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ","Ross Muken","You highlighted the momentum that has been building on the cross-sell opportunity with utilizing the data sets to continue to drive really nice net orders at Covance. I guess if you think about companies that do things that are outside the norm and are groundbreaking, it usually takes some time and network effect amongst the customers to gain momentum. How do you feel like that translated into conversations that are going on amongst your different customer base and understanding the value prop and how you are differentiated and how that can lead to improved either enrollment times or patient quality or what have you in terms of them really starting to understand and see some references to where you are having maybe a different effect and a point of differentiation versus your competitors?","Dave King","Ross, this is Dave. I will start and then ask Deb if she has any further comments. I can tell you from my direct interactions with senior executives at the biopharma companies, I mean they instinctively understand the value of the data -- and of the LabCorp data and the patient data and the patient engagement and intimacy that we bring. As we said, the number one pain point in terms of getting trials started is finding sites, finding good investigators and particularly finding patients, and you look at the statistics most trials are under enrolled. A large majority of trial sites never enroll a patient. Oncology trials, in particular, suffer from a lack of patient enrollment, which makes it hard to get the drugs approved and brought to market. So, my experience has been this is readily understood. It is something that our customers are very enthusiastic about, and we have a lot of demand, not only for help us find patients for traditional trials, but also help us find patients for observational studies help us create a database of patients for registry studies. I think this is just a terrific and unique tool.","Deborah Keller","Yes, the only other thing that I would add Ross, as you know, I think this combination has allowed us to change the conversation with clients, I spend quite a bit of time on the road meeting with clients and they are very interested about, the different capabilities and solutions that are unique to Covance and LabCorp and I think the clients have -- I think if you look at some of the research that's been out there, they feel that we're making the right investments to meet not only their needs today, but their needs as clinical trials transform.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is comes from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Amanda Murphy","I actually just had a follow-up to Ross's question. So, it seems like in terms of the consent database that that is quite a valuable asset and probably quite difficult to replicate without having the diagnostic piece. But it also seems like that's a U.S. focused asset. So can you just talk through how the combined LabCorp is working to leverage the incremental patient data that you have outside of the U.S. to deliver value to pharma?","Dave King","Yes, Amanda, good morning. It is Dave. Obviously, part of the challenge there, particularly in Europe, is the privacy regulations are much, much more complicated. So, we are working with partners to expand capabilities beyond the U.S. database, as well as to expand engagement within the U.S. database to other patient sets, and we will continue to explore that as a way to make this an even more global tool.","Deborah Keller","Amanda the only other thing I'd add is still a majority of the clinical trials are done in the United States, so it does give us an advantage for our clients.","Amanda Murphy","And then just on Beacon, also curious about your perspective longer-term in terms of expanding to additional payors and then also shifting the pricing model away from pass-through to maybe incorporate in some fashion the value-add that you are providing? Just was looking for your thoughts longer-term there?","Dave King","Yes, I think the first thing to remember about Beacon is this is something that was invented. I mean literally invented and built by the Beacon team. They have done a fantastic job bringing the vision to market, and I think we should be -- we should understand and appreciate how hard it is to start something like this up from scratch, build it, build the software tools, get client adoption. So, we're thrilled with where Beacon is today. And I think it's very important as we continue to build additional tools like genetic and molecular capabilities, further decision-support tools for physicians that we expand the scope of Beacon to include more capabilities. I remain very optimistic that there will be additional market opportunities for Beacon, and my hope is that we will have some positive developments on that in the year. And the other thing I would say in terms of the profitability is I do expect Beacon to be profitable in the nearer term as opposed to just pass through, however recognizing that it will not be as profitable ever as the core business because it is just a business of a different nature.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicholas Jansen of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Nicholas Jansen","Just wanted to get a better sense of the Covance revenue synergies, I think you mentioned over 190 million orders as it pertains to that $150 million bucket that you previously communicated. So, what does that order translate into revenue dollars, so we get a better sense of where we are on that front, and sitting here 12 months post transaction, how comfortable are you with the other phases of the revenue synergies? We haven't heard too many specific updates on the other pieces? Thanks.","Dave King","Good morning Nick. It's Dave. So, obviously the rate at which the orders translate to revenue depends on the progress with the pharma companies in terms of when they reach finality on what they want the drug to be developed and what the study parameters look like. So, that's probably a 12 to 18 month timeframe to actually get those orders translating into revenue, and we don't intend to update the dollars that are translating into revenue. We will just keep you advised, not specific order by order, but generally against the 150 target.","On the 100 million that we talked about for companion diagnostics, I mean I think we have been very clear that we have done extremely well, and I think we in all likelihood, if I had to handicap it now, I think we will exceed that 100 million over the three-year period, just because that business has been thriving with the combined tools, and I commented on that I think at some length in the prepared remarks. I think on what we had identified as the last 50 million, which is the real-world evidence that is probably a longer-term impact just because of the number of areas in which real-world evidence is likely to be applicable. But net-net I feel very confident that what we identified as the 300 million in revenue synergies by 2018 will be accomplished.","Nicholas Jansen","And then just on the and maybe Glenn on the bad debt side, we've seen your peer also callout bad debt from an acceleration from a year-over-year perspective and I know you guys are working hard on LaunchPad to kind of offset some of that, but just maybe going to what we're seeing from a patient collectability front and how we should be thinking about bad debt over the next 12 to 18 months? Thank you.","Glenn Eisenberg","Again some of that is just seasonal, we always see our higher bad debt raise in the first quarter and then taper off throughout the rest of the year, but what was unique for this first quarter was that on a year-over-year basis instead of seeing the progress that we have been experiencing we actually saw the rate go up for the first times, and so similar to again an industry issue where we have higher patient responsibility, higher deductible plans earlier on in the year. As we look going forward while it is still expected to be a challenge. We do expect the rate to come down, we think it will be more comparable with what we experienced year-over-year. So we don't expect it to be a overall constrain on the margins, but driven by the success that we're experiencing on our LaunchPad initiatives that will only continue to accrue favorably going forward so initial in the quarter don't expect it to be one going forward but were not for the LaunchPad could be.","Dave King","And Nick it is Dave just to add a little color to that, obviously we are seeing more and more patients in high deductible plans whether through exchanges or through commercial and employer plans. So more patients in high deductibles plans means more dollars out of pocket before there is any insurance payment whatsoever. What that means is with higher deductibles higher patient responsibility at the onset of the year and then we're also seeing plans with higher co-pays and with a greater incidence of non-covered services, so between those three factors you're seeing more dollars of exposure flowing to patient and although our patient collection rate is generally very good, it's still has more dollars for the patients just puts more pressure on collecting overall, in that overall components. And as Glenn said some upward movement in the quarter but we still feel confident that for the year we will be in the same range as we were last year.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Will Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Will Quirk","First question here, on Beacon, Dave, as we think about the expansion of the program, do you think that we're going to end up going through trialing periods as this expands beyond Florida, or do you think that you can take all of the experiences learned from the initial rollout and the trialing program there and put a full program in force when you expand it?","Dave King","I think Beacon is readily scalable, and I think there have been some very good lessons learned for us in Florida, as there always is when you do something new. So, I don't anticipate a lot of difficulty in scaling the program to new markets or two new payers. Remember, it is a soft -- it is basically a software tool, and so the whole idea of Beacon was build one and use many times not have to build a bunch of customizable solutions, and I think we have done a very nice job achieving that.","Will Quirk","And then as a follow up. Just thinking a little about a couple of the macro topics obviously a lot has been said about the FDA regulation of LDTs but can you talk a little bit about kind of twisting this a little bit there might be a potential opportunity here for Covance have you guys thought about that and if so is there any way to size that potential market? Thanks.","Dave King","Well I think I guess I would say as we think about FDA regulation of LDTs, our position has been pretty clear. There may be some opportunity for Covance there although again remember that in companion diagnostics development we have supported both LDT launches and kits depending on the preference of the pharmaceutical partner and the, what they want the outcome to be so I don\u2019t think of it as, I think of it as there is a very large incremental market for companion diagnostics but I don\u2019t know that that would translate into LDTs versus I wouldn\u2019t break it down LDTs versus kits, I would just think about it as what is the global companion diagnostics opportunity look like as we know that's very, very robust.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky Goldwasser","I have two follow-up questions. One, on the volume side, in the prepared remarks, you talked about 3.4% increase in organic volume with some moving parts around the weather and leap year and obviously Easter. So, can you help just quantify for us what were organic volume excluding those moving parts?","Glenn Eisenberg","Hi, Ricky this is Glenn. That's right. From an organic volume standpoint, the 3.4% included the net benefits of those three items that we would say would be roughly call it, 1.5% to 2% benefit out of that 3.4%.","Ricky Goldwasser","So where should we kind of expect seeing volume continue to be in line with what they were last year on an organic basis it seemed so?","Glenn Eisenberg","That is right.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. So, then my next just follow-up relates to Covance. So, it seems that Covance's margin has expanded nicely by about 280 basis points in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. So, how does that 14.7% margin for Covance compare to your internal goals, and what is your long-term margin target for the segment?","Glenn Eisenberg","Ricky, this is Glenn. I will start and Deb may want to provide some color as well. But obviously first 200 we would say it was up 280, so we want to give them full credit for a very strong quarter in margin improvement, driven off of obviously a very strong top-line growth for the Company. There is seasonality in the rate, so we would always expect the first quarter rate for the segment to be low in the first quarter and then pick up for the year. So, from our perspective, it is continued growth in margin year over year. Given the strong demand, given the productivity, given the synergies that we are still capturing, we do expect another strong margin improvement year, and I would be remiss if Deb didn't come back and say her expectation is always to continue to drive those margins going forward. But, Deb, you may want to add some color.","Deborah Keller","Yes the only color I would add Ricky is that we had strong growth in both central labs and early development demand and both of those had nice drop through on an incremental and they were the biggest driver of our OM expansion in that coupled with our cost synergies and usually first quarter tends to be a softer quarter but we did well. So we continue to expect the full year margins to improve.","Ricky Goldwasser","So, was there any pull forward in the quarter, or should we just expect the business for the remainder of the year to continue at kind of that pace?","Dave King","There is nothing pull forward, Ricky. The synergy plan is obviously clearly laid out internally, and we didn't pull anything forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Isaac Ro ","A question on free cash flow, you guys raised guidance for revenue and EPS, and I was wondering if you could maybe break down some of the key moving parts that would explain why the free cash guidance is not also going up?","Glenn Eisenberg","Hi, Isaac this is Glenn. First, obviously, the guidance we have maintained at the call it 900 million to 950 million. When you look at the improvement in the earnings-per-share guidance, which we have taken up to $0.10, we commented around $0.05 of that was from the gain on the sale of securities from our venture fund. While we did pick up plus or minus around 15 million in cash from the sale of those securities, that does not show up in free cash flow. It is below the operating line, so that cash would not be included. So, it's really just the operating improvement impacting EPS that would be cash related. Given where we are in the year and we have a 50 million spread between the 900 million and 950 million and the fact that the first quarter is seasonally low -- we did around 52 million of our free cash versus our 900 million plus for the year -- we felt it appropriate to maintain the current level of our guidance, and then obviously after the second quarter with six months remaining, we will go ahead and revisit it.","Isaac Ro","And then a follow up on the onetime gains, can you maybe walk us through the process that you typically go through to determine when you monetize those investments and to what extent might we want to keep in mind the possibility for more of that come this year? Thank you.","Dave King","Isaac it is Dave we have a funded mix venture investments and those investments are typically in areas that we think are of either long term opportunity or things we would like to know more about or things that might be additive to our business or disruptive to our business. And any time, so for example, one of our earlier investments went public. We are not in the business of owning public -- shares in public company and so with at that point we made the decision to monetize it. We look at our return, the continued value of our investment over the long term whether we are being asked to invest more at a time that we choose to monetize and each one on a case-by-case business we make a determination of what makes sense. So there is no way to predict when these events will occur and periodically we have some losers as well as some winners and that is something we can really build into any model.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Whit Mayo of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Whit Mayo","I have really just got one question. I just wanted to go back to the Covance cost synergies. Just curious where you are finding most of the opportunities? Is this mostly procurement savings and whether or not you have consolidated anything on the central lab at this point and if that is an opportunity going forward?","Glenn Eisenberg","We have consolidated the Singapore central labs, and we're in the process obviously of evaluating other appropriate facility consolidations. Some of the savings this quarter come from consolidation of data centers of Covance data centers into LabCorp capabilities. I think it is very broadly based across public company costs, procurement costs, personnel costs, duplicative capabilities that can be streamlined. So, there isn't any single area to point out, other than to say that we continue to evaluate not only the Covance business, but the integrated businesses and the corporate infrastructure to identify additional opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentleman due to time constrains, we do ask that you please limit yourself to a one question at this time. And our next question comes from Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Ryan Halsted","This is Ryan Halsted in for Gary. Just my one question, on the revenue guidance update, excluding the currency impact, Covance revenue guidance is for about -- increased by 250 basis points. I was wondering if you could call out where you expect to see the majority of that growth, is it primarily from the central lab, or how should we think about that? Thanks.","Glenn Eisenberg","Hi Ryan, this is Glenn. I will at least start with the comment that -- and I think it was alluded to in opening remarks as well -- that we have been very pleased with the broad-based view of how Covance is performing across all the major business lines. When you look at the implied guidance for the rest of the year that are, call it, around 6% growth, we believe it is broad based and consistent with what Dave categorized before as normal, call it, historical growth within the segment.","Dave King","And it is Dave. We're not going to provide revenue guidance by segment within segment, so I agree with Glenn. Think of it as just -- it is broad based across the entire business.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is now open.","A.J. Rice","Just two pricing-related questions, if I've got my calculation right, your revenue per requisition in the quarter stepped up from the fourth-quarter rate to about 50 basis points to 2.7% year to year. Is that mix, or is there underlying price trend and how much you factor that into the updated guidance? And then I guess longer-term pricing, any update on the clinical lab fee schedule reset and your discussions with CMS and Congress?","Glenn Eisenberg","Hi A.J., I will start with just the price mix comment. It is primarily mix related. Obviously, we benefited from acquisitions that have mixed us up. Plus, we talked about in the mix within our test group. Pricing has been relatively stable, which is a positive. We also do have some LaunchPad initiatives that are targeted to the pricing side, but overall we would say that the increase that you saw within the price mix is primarily mix related.","Dave King","And A.J., it is Dave. On PAMA, as you probably saw this week, the -- a notice was filed in the Federal Register indicating that the final rule has gone over to OMB for review. So there obviously has been a step forward by CMS. We don't have insight into what is in the final rule, but hopefully it has addressed a couple of the major issues with the definition of applicable labs and some of the other things that we highlighted. We continue to work with CMS and obviously with all of the constituencies in Congress on both the definitional and the timeline for implementation and, again, highlight the letter from Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden, as well as the letter from 26, I believe, members of the House and other members of the Senate, indicating that a January 2017 implementation date was -- is not practical. We fully agree with that, and we hope and expect that CMS will be taking a practical and reasonable approach.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Tanquilut","Glenn, just really quick on G&A, it ticked up quite a bit sequentially. How should we think about that over the course of the year?","Glenn Eisenberg","Just to your point, it is obviously going to fluctuate quarter to quarter, but as you think about it for the full year, we do expect to see leverage from G&A. We benefited on a pro forma basis year over year, even in the first quarter, but fairly nominally. So we did see a tick-up in unallocated corporate expenses, which was one of the constraints, if you will. But as we target, call it, the roughly 1.5% of our revenues for that category, we were high for the quarter, but for the full year, we expect to be at that, call it, plus or minus 1.5% level.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Donald Hooker","Maybe just one general question while we have Deb here. When you look at -- when you talk about mobile devices in clinical trials and regulatory issues around that, where exactly are we in using -- broadly speaking, using that mobile devices in different ways in clinical trials and maybe one or two areas where you think would be the biggest source of upside using these Internet-enabled mobile devices?","Deborah Keller","Well, that's a very broad question, so I'll give you a couple of specific answers. One, they're used in clinical trials mainly around patient centricity making it easier for a patient to participate and adhere to the protocol and to do some monitoring but right now what we're working with clients is to develop that because the data has to come in from these different devices and then be put into a system which then could potentially go into a filing, so that's what we're working on, on validating for our clients. So there are a lot of opportunities but I would say the first priority is probably around patient centricity.","Dave King","And it's Dave, I fully agree with Deb, I think also as we think about the mobile suite that we launched one of the critical components is to make sure that the devices that are being used are validated and accurate because there's nothing worse than patients using mobile devices and providing information obviously that's either not validated or that varies from device to device. So that's going to be an important component of use of mobile devices in clinical trials as we go forward and we're pleased that we have the launch the tools to be able to help our clients with that.","Deborah Keller","It's a nice adjacency to our core competency of clinical trials, and we do so many validations so we have the regulatory expertise to solve the validation experience, so it's been a nice offering for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Massaro of Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Mark Massaro","A question for Dave, how do you prioritize M&A between diagnostic and drug developments? And then more specifically, as you think about your core diagnostics business, recently you had a deal in the women's health space, but again how do you prioritize women's health over oncology or NGS? And then maybe a final comment on multiples would be great. Thanks.","Dave King","Well, we have a rigorous process for looking at acquisitions, and it doesn't center on whether it is a diagnostics or a drug development acquisition. It centers on, first of all, does it fit one of our three strategic priorities, which is we have talked about is being the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, number one; number two, bringing novel medicines to patients faster; and number three, using technology and tools to transform the way that care is delivered? So, anything we do has to fit within those three basic parameters. The next thing we look at is, does it enhance our capabilities in a meaningful way, whether those are existing capabilities, whether they are add-on capabilities that we need to be better at the business.","And then is it -- or geographic capabilities. So, it could be footprint. It could be test menu. It could be incremental capabilities that support one or the other of the businesses. Then we look at price, multiples, return on invested capital, IRR, discounted cash flows, all the basic acquisition metrics. And, so, the question what are we prioritizing, the nice thing about our position now is that there are many, many opportunities to deploy capital towards acquisitions, and yet our businesses are performing extremely well. And so there is no major gap that we need to fill. And, so, I don't think I can answer the question, what is the highest priority. The highest priority is high value high return deals that are going to fit our strategic framework.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. King for closing remarks.","Dave King","Thank you, all.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. I would now like to introduce your host for this conference call, Mr. Scott Frommer. You may begin, sir.","Scott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning and welcome to LabCorp's second quarter 2017 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Gary Huff, CEO of LabCorp Diagnostics; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","In addition to our press release, we also filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy, and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. LabCorp delivered record results in the second quarter, highlighted by excellent performance in the Diagnostics business, a substantial increase in net orders and book-to-bill in the Drug Development business and continued strong progress on our enterprise initiatives.","We reported year-over-year growth in revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS against our strongest quarter from last year. In addition, we reported solid free cash flow of $240 million and returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases, bringing our year-to-date total repurchases to over $250 million.","The distinctive advantages of our integrated solutions are resonating with customers and partners. In the quarter, we announced two significant partnerships and closed several major health system transactions. We are collaborating with Walgreens, Novant Health, Mount Sinai, Providence Health & Services and Catholic Health Initiatives, prestigious healthcare organizations that share our focus on the innovation to improve health and improve lives. Through these partnerships, we are expanding the impact of our offerings, developing innovative solutions for the rapidly changing healthcare environment and driving long-term profitable growth.","In Diagnostics, despite the unfavorable impact from the calendar of approximately 150 basis points, we had outstanding top line growth with another quarter of significant increases in both total and organic volume as well as in revenue per requisition. Our broad-based strength and utilization was powered in part by our strategic focus on women's health and reproductive genetics. Our acquisition of Sequenom, a leader in non-invasive prenatal testing, has reenergized our larger genetic testing portfolio and is performing ahead of expectations.","I also would like to highlight our longstanding strategic collaboration with 23andMe, which has demonstrated an impressive growth trajectory, represents an important innovative component of our consumer-facing offerings and presents further strategic collaboration opportunities.","In Drug Development, the trends improved as we expected. Although our financial performance was down year-on-year, consistent with our guidance, we completed our third straight quarter of strong net orders and improved our trailing 12-month book-to-bill to 1.23. This trajectory positions the business to resume growth the remainder of the year and accelerate growth in 2018 and beyond. Moreover, as anticipated, we delivered sequential improvement in revenue, adjusted operating income and margin and generated initial savings from the Covance LaunchPad initiative.","Now I will update you on progress during the quarter on key strategic initiatives, beginning with our initiatives focused on the power of our combination of Diagnostics and Drug Development. From the time of the Covance acquisition, we identified the combination of LabCorp Diagnostics' patient insights and Covance's global position in investigator performance data as an attractive growth opportunity. This data-driven competitive advantage continues to yield strong results.","LabCorp patient data has helped Covance secure approximately 25 new awards since the acquisition in multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology, infectious disease, cardiovascular and gastroenterology. The dollar value of these awards continues to increase, and we are approaching $0.5 billion in orders won.","The combined data is part of almost every proposal we submit and is increasingly valued by sponsors. We are pleased with the ongoing revenue contribution from these projects and enthusiastic about the pipeline of future opportunities to leverage our unique data set.","In one recent example, our Informatics team illustrated to a key large bio-pharma client how our proprietary insights can reveal patient availability, anticipate site performance, and inform protocol design and exclusion inclusion criteria. Access to the data set supported our clinical and medical operations teams and led the client to select Covance as one of two preferred CRO partners to develop its late-stage portfolio, consisting of a series of trials in diabetes, neurology and oncology.","We further highlighted at the time of the acquisition the importance of our companion diagnostics offering. LabCorp is uniquely positioned in this important sector of precision medicine with our end-to-end development capabilities through Covance and our commercialization channel from Diagnostics.","Our industry-leading expertise and experience is evident from LabCorp's role in the development of approximately three quarters of the companion diagnostics in clinical use today. During this quarter, we opened a dedicated state-of-the-art companion diagnostics laboratory in North Carolina and delivered double-digit increase in year-on-year revenue aided by continued growth in immuno-oncology services. We also won $100 million in companion diagnostic-related awards during the first half of the year, a record result. Our pipeline spans a diverse range of oncology and non-oncology indications with new and established clients and positions us well for growth in the future.","Our last key enterprise initiative involves health systems, which continued to see broad-based solutions from us. In response, we are focused on cultivating deep enterprise-wide relationships, including access to clinical trials and research opportunities through Covance, enhanced technology applications, data analytics, standardized testing platforms and broad patient care management and access.","Our emphasis on strategic, profitable and mutually beneficial partnerships demands a selective approach to expanding our business in this area. Mount Sinai, PAML and Novant Health contributed to our strong top line results in the quarter. And the announcement of partnerships with these leading health systems continues to invigorate our already-robust pipeline of premier health system opportunities. We continue to invest in our team and capabilities to drive this important strategic growth initiative.","In addition to progress on enterprise-wide opportunities, our individual businesses also delivered important successes in the quarter. I mentioned the value of strategic partnerships a few moments ago. Last month, we announced our LabCorp, Walgreens collaboration to locate patient service centers in Walgreens stores.","By bringing our lab testing services to a high quality, healthcare-centric retail environment, we will enhance patient convenience, increase direct patient engagement, broaden our channel in the market and build brand identification and loyalty. We view the LabCorp, Walgreens initiative as additive to our existing PSC footprint, providing attractive opportunities to strategically expand our channel and customer access points with a globally-trusted partner. In addition, this collaboration presents significant opportunities to leverage our complementary offerings and expertise to jointly deliver patient care.","We also made strong progress in other elements of our consumer strategy, changing the way care is delivered. We now offer a pre-draw estimate to patients with most commercial insurance plans that shows their anticipated out-of-pocket costs. This service is available at all LabCorp patient service centers and a growing number of sites where LabCorp phlebotomists collect specimens in physician offices.","We also continue to add content to our web-based cost estimator that allows consumers to calculate their out-of-pocket costs for testing services based on their health insurance information before their encounter. These solutions will help patients make informed financial decisions related to the transparent cost of our services.","In addition, we continue to enhance the patient experience and convenience in our patient service centers through easy self check-in options, opportunities to learn more about clinical trials and free WiFi.","Our customer focus extends beyond the patient and consumer experience. We continue to invest in technology to expand our offerings for hospitals, health systems, ACOs, large provider groups and managed-care partners. We are focused on enhancing our integrated data capabilities, including self-service report delivery, high frequency data feeds and new patient care management and trending insights. These upgrades will continue to support our customers' value-based care and population health management initiatives.","In our Drug Development business, we continue to invest in the future. Our focus on accelerating growth includes attracting additional strong talent, leveraging the breadth of our Drug Development offerings and further differentiating our award-winning Xcellerate Informatics platform. These areas of emphasis underpin the important role that Covance plays in bringing innovative medicines to patients faster.","During the quarter we continued to deepen the Covance bench, adding experienced clinical development leadership and strategic partnering, deal development in key therapeutic areas. The strong net orders, increased backlog and improved book-to-bill in the quarter were driven by the depth of our customer relationships and the execution of our commercial organization.","Covance's differentiated offering is rooted in its comprehensive Drug Development solutions, diverse therapeutic expertise and its one Covance collaborative approach. For example, a recent Phase III win for an oncology drug highlights our integrated development approach focused at the molecule level. We initiated work on this molecule in 2011, with the first in-human dosing study and subsequently executed the Phase II trial as well. This longstanding engagement on a single product produced a strong level of trust with the customer, created opportunities to win other awards, enhanced efficiency and quality in the Drug Development process, and reduced its costs.","Our deep scientific and therapeutic expertise is another point of differentiation. We continue to be successful in higher-value therapeutic areas and indications such as immuno-oncology, NASH and diabetic nephropathy, complex disease states in which customers have repeatedly chosen Covance. The biomarker-driven nature of these clinical indications aligns particularly well with the strength of our combined company.","Lastly, we added new capabilities to our Xcellerate Informatics Suite during the quarter, including the Xcellerate Risk and Issue Management module. This application empowers clients with improved workflow management capabilities, replacing current manual tools. We also implemented further product enhancements, enabling Xcellerate users to drive operational efficiency and reduce the number of manual tracking documents.","The investments we are making in Covance extend beyond our focus on revenue growth. As discussed last quarter, the expansion of LaunchPad is underway as we are rightsizing the resources supporting each business area.","We are also focused on longer-term business process improvement initiatives to re-engineer Drug Development solutions, utilize new tools and technology, enhance the customer and employee experience, sustainably increase our margins. We continue to make solid progress advancing this initiative, adhering to the roadmap of our highly successful Diagnostics LaunchPad initiative.","In closing, we continue to deliver strong performance as we make substantial progress on our key strategic initiatives, capitalizing on multiple growth opportunities across our markets. Fueled by the contribution of more than 50,000 colleagues around the world, LabCorp's ability to improve health and improve lives, differentiated solutions, participate in global healthcare markets, and unlock long-term shareholder value has never been stronger and will create tremendous value in the quarters and years ahead.","Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2017 guidance.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 4.9% over last year, as organic revenue increased 1.9% and acquisitions added 3.6%. This growth was partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 60 basis points. In addition, revenue growth was constrained by approximately 100 basis points due to the unfavorable impact from the year-over-year comparison to Leap Year and the timing of the Easter holiday.","Operating income for the quarter was $336 million or 13.4% of revenue, compared to $366 million or 15.3%, last year. The decline in operating income was due to restructuring charges and special items in the quarter of $50 million compared to $15 million a year ago, primarily related to severance in connection with the Covance LaunchPad initiative and the termination of a software development project.","Adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges and special items, was $437 million or 17.5% of revenue, compared to $425 million or 17.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to favorable price mix, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. The 40-basis-point decline in margin was due to the impact from the year-over-year comparison to Leap Year and the timing of the Easter holiday.","The tax rate for the quarter was 33.7%, down from 34.5% last year, primarily due to the company having a higher percentage of its earnings in lower tax rate foreign jurisdictions in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate, excluding special charges and amortization, was 33.6% compared to 33.8% last year. We continue to expect the full-year tax rate to be approximately 34%.","Net earnings for the quarter were $189 million or $1.82 per diluted share, adjusted EPS, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges and other special items, were $2.47 in the quarter, up 4.7% over last year.","Operating cash flow was $311 million in the quarter compared to $350 million a year ago. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher working capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $69 million or 2.8% of revenue, compared to $67 million or 2.8% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $241 million in the quarter compared to $283 million last year. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $403 million, an increase of 19% over last year due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital usage.","At quarter end, our cash balance was $300 million, down from $366 million at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we invested $416 million in acquisitions and repurchased $108 million of stock. As of June 30, we had $490 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. Total debt at quarter end was $6.1 billion and the company's leverage was 3.2 times gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA.","Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, an increase of 8.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions, organic volume, measured by requisitions, price and mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 30 basis points. Revenue per requisition increased 3.6%, benefiting from price mix and the Sequenom acquisition. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing.","Total volume increased 5%, of which organic volume was 1.9%. We achieved this result despite the negative impact of approximately 1.5% from the year-over-year comparison to Leap Year and the timing of the Easter holiday. Acquisition volume was 3.1%, which includes our recently completed PAML and Mount Sinai transactions.","LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $375 million or 20.8% of revenue compared to $355 million or 21.4% last year. The $20 million increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to strong organic revenue growth, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. LaunchPad remains on track to deliver net savings of $150 million through the three-year period ending this year. The 60-basis-point decline in margin was due to the impact from the year-over-year comparison to Leap Year and the timing of the Easter holiday.","Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $700 million, a decline of 3.1% from last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 140 basis points of negative currency, revenue was down 1.7% compared to last year, primarily due to the cancellation of two large clinical studies in late 2016. We continue to expect to achieve higher revenue and margins both sequentially and year-over-year in the second half of this year.","Adjusted operating income was $95 million or 13.6% of revenue compared to $108 million or 14.9% last year. The decline in operating income and margin were primarily due to lower revenue and increased personnel costs, including targeted strategic investments in the clinical business to support growth, partially offset by favorable price, mix, cost synergies and initial savings from the Covance LaunchPad initiative.","We remain on track to achieve our target of $100 million in cost synergies through the three-year period ending this year and have largely completed the remaining consolidation of our central lab facilities in Europe and the U.S. In addition, we continue to expect to generate initial savings from Covance's LaunchPad initiative of $20 million this year, which will annualize the $45 million beginning in 2018. We are also actively planning for the expansion of this initiative and we will update you when our planning is complete.","The strategic investments that we have made to enhance the businesses' leadership, sales force and capabilities are beginning to pay off as we posted a strong improvement in net orders and book-to-bill. For the trailing 12 months, net orders were $3.4 billion, an increase of $200 million over last quarter's trailing 12 months, producing an improved net book-to-bill of 1.23. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $5.5 billion and we expect approximately $2.1 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","Now I'll update our 2017 guidance, which assumes foreign-exchange rates as of June 30 for the remainder of 2017 and includes the anticipated capital allocation. We expect reported revenue growth of 5% to 6.5% after adjusting for the negative impact of approximately 10 basis points of foreign currency translation. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 3.5% to 5.5%.","We expect LabCorp Diagnostics reported revenue growth of 7% to 8%. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 5% to 7%, primarily due to continued strong organic growth and acquisitions. We expect Covance Drug Development reported revenue growth of 1% to 3% after adjusting for the negative impact of approximately 20 basis points of foreign currency translation. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 0% to 2%.","We expect revenue growth of 1.2% to 3.2% on a constant-currency basis, which is consistent with our prior guidance. Our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance is $9.30 to $9.65, an increase of 5% to 9% over 2016 and higher than our prior guidance of $9.20 to $9.60, primarily due to the strength of our second quarter results. And finally, we expect free cash flow to be between $925 million and $975 million, unchanged from our prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks and we will now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a strong quarter. Just wanted to get a better understanding of the core \u2013 the accelerating organic revenue growth that's built into the Covance guidance for the back half of the year. I know net orders and book-to-bill have been really strong over the last two quarters but just your level of visibility in terms of backlog conversion. Are we through kind of a lot of the noise that we've seen over the last 12 months on revenues? Thanks.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, I think that you pegged it. It is based on the backlog that we have and then the last 12 months book-to-bill, the 1.23 in the last 12 months and that's up from the 1.15 as of last quarter and 1.11 at the beginning of the year. That net order rate will then allow us to have revenue growth in the second half of 2017. We expect revenue growth in all segments, ED, clinical and central labs. And that, obviously, then allows us to push through the reason for the slower revenue growth in the first half, it was primarily due to the cancellation by the sponsors, the two large studies in late 2016. And so that is the rationale for the revenue growth and backlog conversion. Although slower, based on the complexity of the trials as well as mix, as well as start-up, we do see the revenue growth for the second half and therefore the implied revenue growth in all segments.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And, Nick, it's Dave. Just a reminder that the cancellations will annualize in 4Q, so that will improve the year-over-year comp as we get toward the end of the year.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And my follow-up question would be on the Diagnostics side. Clearly demonstrating strong organic volume growth, actually accelerating sequentially. Just maybe give us an update on your market share positioning right now. How are these new health system relationships that you've developed over the last 12 months kind of helping that figure? And then how do we think about the pipeline for M&A as the reimbursement environment continues to be in flux for some of these hospital labs, which will face more \u2013 greater reimbursement pressures relative to you guys? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It's Dave. I'll start, and then if Gary has any further comments. So, obviously, we're very pleased with the organic growth and a number of factors are contributing, the women's health focus, the immuno-oncology and companion diagnostics, genetics driven by Sequenom, 23andMe has been a major contributor to organic volume growth as well.","The health system partnerships are off to an excellent start. Obviously, they're \u2013 we're in early days with both Mount Sinai and PAML, but they have both exceeded our expectations in terms of performance up to this time and contribute volume as well as additional opportunities for strategic partnership and growth. So we're very pleased with the caliber of the institutions that we're forming these deep partnerships with and we continue to see a robust pipeline of opportunities for hospital partnerships.","Gary M. Huff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And Dave, I'd like to add on to that as well. Nicholas, we saw very broad-based growth in organic, which was very encouraging, because we have had a strategy of focusing on increasing and enhancing customer value through deeper patient or customer relationships. And I think when you go to the health systems piece, once again, our strategy of creating deep, broad-based relationships with anchor health plans or health systems helps us to create additional value through added products and solutions.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to continue on the lab side. A much bigger organic volume number we were expecting, especially in light of the calendar. Did you see any inflection in the underlying trends at all? And then similar to the hospital commentary, in addition to just doing deals, are you seeing any additional willingness to outsource versus in-source with some of the regulatory changes on the horizon?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Jack, it's Dave. I'll take the second part of the question first. Obviously, we're in a position where there is considerable uncertainty about what particularly the government reimbursement environment is going to look like going forward. I don't think that's changed a lot of perspectives in terms of the hospital labs. I think maybe it's accelerated some decision making. But we see more a desire to, at least in the customers that we're targeting, to partner broadly at the strategic level around the on-site laboratory, the reference work, the pathology, the patient recruitment, the care management, the analytics and that's our focus and has always been our focus in terms of how we think about these health system partnerships. So we're optimistic that we're going to continue to have significant deals to announce, but they take time and as we said in the prepared comments, we want to be selective about how we choose to allocate our resources and where we can bring the most value.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then \u2013 and just on the first part of that question, related to any sequential underlying trends in the volume rate?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I don't think there's any particular inflection points. We've seen a nice, steady increase across a number of these areas. I will say, obviously, the non-invasive prenatal testing is growing and that's pulling along other OB\/GYN work, which is really one of the major value propositions that we have with Sequenom. So \u2013 but we're seeing nice, broad-based growth across the core and with esoteric growing a little bit faster than the core business, we're seeing strong positives across the environment.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And if I could just follow up on PAML, how much revenue percentage remains with the JVs that remain outstanding? And did that contribute to any of the margin decline there in the lab business?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So the \u2013 I don't have the specific number in terms of the revenue that's outstanding but in terms of the margin decline, remember the impact of the days explains the margin decline entirely. That said, we would've had margin improvement but for the mix down from the acquisitions that have closed because they're not fully integrated into the business yet and so they haven't reached operating margins.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. The one thing I'd just add, albeit it's what David said, the acquisitions obviously did have a negative mix impact on our margins as they become fully integrated. But with your specific question on the JVs, until they're consolidated, if you will, they show up below our lines, so really not impacting our operating income at the segment level but ultimately when we close those deals, the net income will move up to the segment as well.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks very much. Dave, I just wanted to start with PAMA. Yesterday Quest had made a comment that the ACLA had met and reiterated the thought that not everyone that's being included today or not \u2013 all the hospital outreach to be included are not necessarily being included and basically thought that perhaps that this could be pushed out from a timeline perspective. I just wanted to get your thoughts around that.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, we sent a letter to CMS, met with the CMS Administrator, have had multiple legislative and executive branch meetings, explained that the data set that they are reviewing includes only approximately 5% of the hospital volume that goes through hospital labs. And as we know, there's a significant delta between what hospitals get paid by commercial insurance and what independent laboratories get paid. So as we've said from the very beginning, the Congress intended to have a market-based approach, and the rule that CMS wrote, and we said this in our initial comments of the rule and we've been saying it ever since, the rule that CMS wrote looks at a highly selective portion of the market in a way that doesn't reflect the true market.","So we've asked for a six-month delay for them to fix the rule to allow for inclusion of the hospital laboratory, outreach laboratories and the commercial pricing that's not included. I don't have any insight on whether that would be permitted or not other than to say that ACLA and all of our colleagues in the industry and other laboratory trade associations as well and the hospital trade associations have been involved in discussions with CMS and with the legislative and executive branch about trying to make this proposal work the way that it was intended to work.","So I'm hopeful that we'll get a better resolution than what we have seen to-date.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And when will we hear, though, about the \u2013 so you send the letter, you go through this whole process, is there a timeline that they need to respond to you in X number of days so we would know before the ruling comes out in September? Or would it be simultaneously that they \u2013 or they come out at that point and say, look, we're going to delay it because we've now taken a second look and we've decided the following? I mean, I'm just trying to understand this better from a timing perspective.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. I wish there were specific requirements, but there are not. So when we were having trouble loading the data in the portal, we made multiple requests for an extension of the deadline and we didn't hear for quite a while, and then they agreed to extend the deadline, pretty close to the initial deadline, which, as I recall, was in March, and they gave us a 60-day extension. So we're optimistic that they'll respond in a timely fashion. I will say, though, we are obviously preparing for next year on the assumption that there's not going to be any change in the implementation and that we need to take the appropriate actions to manage whatever will come out in September.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Dave, so from the CRO business, we can obviously infer from the improved TTM (35:59) book-to-bill that bookings were strong in the quarter. I'm not sure if you touched on this before or not, but just how do we think about the bookings trends in early-stage development versus late-stage? Are you seeing, perhaps, greater strength in one side more than the other or are things pretty broad-based as far as the improvement in net orders?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","This is John. And thanks for the question, Steve. The strength is pretty broad-based. This past quarter, it was actually from the lab side. Over the last three quarters, it's been over \u2013 the strongest unit would be on the clinical side. And then early development, though, had strength, even last quarter, and so the proposals are up in the early development area as well as quarter-to-quarter on clinical and the lab side. So just to say that the strength's in all areas, the 1.23 book-to-bill is even with a weak third quarter of 2016 inside of it. So we look to continue that strength throughout the second half.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And one other quick follow-up. I know you guys talked previously about, perhaps, improving your functional service provider or FSP offerings. Where do we stand on that right now? And has that helped in any of the accelerated bookings in the quarter?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It has helped in terms of the first half. We have actually a pretty robust business in terms of the FSP and the monitoring areas with a number of different large clients. And at the same time, we'd like to strengthen the FSPs and the biometrics area, et cetera, but nice strength within the FSP area. That also say in that clinical business, we've actually seen nice diversity of the business wins, we know we've talked to you about oncology, and it'll stay a strength in our backlog. But we've had that even broaden out to the FSP business, to the cardiovascular, metabolic areas as well. And so somewhat stabilized in that regard, and given wider diversity on the strength of our talent that we've added and\/or the strength of the talent that we have within the business.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. That's helpful color. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Just sticking sort of in the same vein as Steve, as we think about all the M&A that's going on in the CRO side, obviously you guys are much farther into your process in terms of having integrated the asset. And, obviously, others have dealt with also a number of the industry challenges. As you think about sort of the potential for share gains in the market now that you could potentially exploit some of the investments you've made and utilize the technology portion. And hopefully we're sort of through this period of cancellations, although that's always tough to predict. How are you thinking about the setup of you versus the remainder of the space from that perspective? And whether or not, particularly on the clinical side, you guys can start making greater strides? Obviously, this quarter orders were great, but consistently show maybe some share progression over the maybe next 36 or 24 months?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Ross, this is Dave. Obviously we're happy to comment on our own business, and, I think, John has done an excellent job of that. I think we're extremely well positioned. We continue to invest in the things we need to be positioned in. We continue to invest in the areas that we need to strengthen, such as the FSP and some of the therapeutic areas. So I think we're going to be very well positioned.","Ultimately, how we get selected is a combination of our strengths and capabilities, our technology, our leadership, our relationships. And we're pleased about where we are, and we're pleased about the improvement. And I think that's all we're going to say on the topic of share and share gain because a lot of that has to do with where the competitors are. It's really not our practice to give commentary on the position of our competitors in the market.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And I'd just say, Ross, just to \u2013 on our strength, A, we're proving it in terms of the net orders. Second, we're proving it with approaching the $500 million in terms of the orders based on data. We're proving it on, as Dave said, companion diagnostics, a solution that's evidence of the combination. We're proving it on really the high level of interest from the health systems and becoming preferred clinical partners. And we're proving it even from the opt-ins that are coming from the patient service centers in terms of the 145,000. And then finally, this is a people-based business, and we're adding talent. We're adding executive talent and deepening our bench, so we feel good about the future.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks. I just had a couple more questions on the Covance side. So, I guess, Dave and John, you've been pretty open with the need to scale the clinical business. So I just wanted to get your latest thoughts there. How you're thinking about increasing exposure to some of the things you've talked about, small, mid-cap pharma, Asia (42:22), et cetera, just especially given the number of CRO assets you've traded so far this year?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Amanda, it's Dave. I think the most important thing for people to take away from what's happened so far this year is we're a disciplined and focused buyer, and when we buy, it's going to be an asset that fits our needs and meets our financial return criteria.","And so we're still interested in doing the things that we've talked about. On the other hand, I should be very clear that we don't have to do anything. We don't have to overpay for an asset. We don't have to acquire something that's not the right fit for us financially, culturally.","So we're going to continue to evaluate our position, invest internally in building our strengths, as John has made reference to, and when we have something further to update you on, we'll absolutely do that.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And then also just a question on the cancellations that are pretty well discussed, but I was curious if you could help us understand the performance of Covance, sort of excluding that in the quarter, was revenue in line with your expectations? And then just thinking about that cancellation \u2013 the two cancellations, just how they progressed over the year. I think that will be helpful just to get a sense. Obviously, you talked about Q4, but just in terms of how that's impacted the year so far and then Q3, or the rest of the year, I guess, would be helpful. Thanks.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, cancellations this past quarter, first half, first three quarters of last year, all in line. The only abnormal one was where we noted in the fourth quarter, and from that vantage point, we, obviously, called that out on the two large studies within the central labs. So cancellations are right in line with what's transpired on five of the last six quarters.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And I think, Amanda, to your specific question on the progression, I think the impact of the cancellations was fairly immediate. So it was first \u2013 it was fourth quarter mostly, and then a little bit lapped over into the first. So that's why you would see the comp in the fourth quarter being over a lower number.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. Hi. And obviously, in terms of those cancellations that kind of happened in November, that's why Dave said, they annualize in the fourth quarter, and then, obviously, then 2018 will be a much more normalized year with respect to that.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","So just from that cancellation perspective, the impact, I mean, I get the annualization piece of it, but the impact through the year, is it straight line then? Or is it \u2013 I think you were saying it was a larger effect right away and then it should diminish, even excluding the annualization point.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes. Amanda, this is Glenn. Yeah, the impact was pretty straight-lined. It was an active program that was scheduled to go through the full year, if you will, for most of the year, and so expect each quarter until we get to the fourth quarter to have the same impact.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks. On the CRO business, can you speak to the overall RFP environment as well as the biotech funding environment? And how your integrated offering is resonating across the larger pharma versus smaller biotech customers? Thanks.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. This is John again. In terms of the biotech business, is robust. It is in the 15% to 20% area of our business, much more significant in the earlier development area. We are up in the biotech in the first half, over 2016. We see that as a significant opportunity to penetrate greater. And that's true within our clinical business as well as our lab business.","We see large pharma, in terms of spend, but more so in the lower single digits in terms of the R&D dollars; the mid-tier in the mid-single digits; and then the biotech's in that higher single-digit territory in terms of the industry. I think one of the advantages that we are seeing is strong growth in that early clinical area that is helping drive the later-stage business, and that should be prolonged, because once you're in a sticky situation with a customer and you execute, then that plays forward, so.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And on the clinical, CRO side more, so how would you characterize the current pricing environment? Are you seeing any sort of shifts or outliers? Or is everyone behaving relatively rationally? Thanks.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Behaving rationally, haven't seen any real outliers.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A couple of questions for me. I guess, first, Dave, thinking about potential M&A on the Diagnostics side, if we consider the continuing performance of Sequenom and I guess, I'd say probably the outperformance of Sequenom, how should we be thinking about, I guess, your deal preference for other specialty lab deals versus your kind of more traditional, kind of routine testing tuck-in deals?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Morning, Bill. Every deal that comes to us gets evaluated against our strategic fit, the financial metrics and then what I would describe as the cultural fit, so leadership and kind of how we think the organization would fit or not fit well with LabCorp. I wouldn't say that we have a particular preference one way or the other. We've done some very interesting esoteric deals. On the other hand, we've done some significant health system deals, which are not focused on particular tests or particular assets but they're focused on partnerships and they're focused on expanding our scale and reach and our patient access.","So, I guess, in the end, the preference is going to be for the deal that is going to best fit our strategic and financial needs and that may be a test menu as with Sequenom that we feel gives us the opportunity to pull more work through from the OB\/GYN and pull more genetics through. It may be geographic, where we want to have a broader presence in a particular market or it may be strategic partnership where we want to add another important component as part of our anchor health system strategy. And I know that's not particularly specific in response to your question, but it actually is the way that we think about these opportunities. Everyone stands alone in terms of being evaluated by the team for, is it the right deal for us to do given those considerations.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Understood. And I appreciate the color, Dave. And then I get separately on PAMA, and I, obviously, recognize that there's a lot of things going on behind the scenes politically but is it reasonable to assume for all of us kind of watching this from the outside as we get closer and closer to September that it's likely that we're going to see the implementation in accordance with the January 1, 2018 deadline or date, excuse me?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I would say that that is the working assumption as we think about things like our 2018 budget. I would also say that I think that would be, from my perspective, a serious mistake if CMS does it. I don't think it's been well thought through. I don't think they've thought about the implications. I was just reading an article that came out in CAP TODAY, I'm probably not supposed to give them a comment on an earnings call, but a system \u2013 a hospital system in New Mexico that serves 125 nursing homes in highly rural areas, and if there are significant cuts to what they get paid by Medicare for those services, we're going to see significant beneficiary access issues in my view and that would be \u2013 this statute was called the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, not the Diminishing Access to Medicare Act. And we made that point to CMS and they told us that Congress didn't tell them to take it as a consideration in the statute. So this is a very, very important policy decision that CMS is going to make. And I hope that they, and Health and Human Services and the legislative branch will be able to come to some understanding that they need to do this right as opposed to just do it and get it done with.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Hey, Dave, I have a couple of quick questions for you. I guess, first on the guidance raise, if we look at the midpoint of where you guys took guidance, and I think versus the midpoint of your old guidance, I think that gets us an incremental $140 million in revenue, give or take. How much of that should flow through to pre-tax? Because I guess, I'm wondering why EPS guidance wasn't taken up more.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Kevin, this is Glenn. Let me start. Obviously, we give a range when we give our guidances, but from our perspective we talked about the increase in the revenue range in part was due to the currency translation but also based upon Diagnostics' strong performance organically as well as acquisitions and primarily the timing of the acquisitions such as PAML.","So when you look at the earnings per share impact from the acquisition side, while they clearly meet our criteria and are accretive in the first year, they start off, obviously, fairly marginal. And then as we integrate them and get the synergies, then the margins kick into, call it, our segment number.","So just illustratively with PAML, you're looking at the revenues that we're having without a corresponding, really meaningful impact in earnings. So assume that the increase that we had, obviously, in our earnings guidance, which we took up \u2013 we narrowed it but also took up the midpoint, was really driven off of the performance that we had in the second quarter. And obviously we'll continue to update that as we go forward.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. No. That makes sense, Glenn. Thanks for the color there. And then kind of a dumb question, so sorry for this one. But you guys called out the 1% impact from Leap Year and the timing of the Easter holiday. I guess, can you explain that to me? I just was thinking about the days. It seems like it's the same number of days this quarter. Easter fell into \u2013 it was March last year, April this year. So where does that come from?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I knew somebody would ask how February ends up in the second quarter. So it's not a dumb question, and the answer is our revenue \u2013 it's the strength of revenue days, Kevin. That's what we compare year-over-year, and the strength of the leap day because of the way the days of the week fall actually does end up in the second quarter even though the day is in February.","And so that's why the impact is so pronounced. Obviously, Easter, because of the holiday time there's a significant shift when it moves from quarter to quarter in volumes. But the leap day is based on the strength of days and the strength of revenue on particular days of the week. And that's why it lands in the second quarter.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","That makes sense.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Kevin, just to...","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Yeah.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","...add to that, obviously, we knew that coming into the year. And so when we provided even the initial guidance last quarter, we talked about the impact that it was going to have in the second quarter, impacting our top line and impacting our margins, which, obviously, it has.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate more on how you're looking at the consumer genetics testing opportunity. It seems like 23andMe is accelerating further. You're involved in some other ways in that market, and it's in the news a lot lately. So if you could elaborate, that would be helpful.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. It's Dave. We've had a long-term collaboration with 23andMe around performing their consumer genetic testing, and they've done a terrific job in the market. So our focus on consumer testing is more on the core testing. It's more on the direct engagement with consumer around the core testing.","And as we said in the prepared comments, see a lot of opportunities for broader collaboration with 23andMe around some of the work that they're doing, but our consumer offering is largely focused on engaging them around what I would characterize as core testing, wellness testing, things that we would think of as more on the routine side.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So a couple of follow-up questions. First of all, just on the questions on the guidance for the year, are you implying that there is potential upside from PAML as the year continues, as we see profits starting to match revenue contribution?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Ricky, it's Dave. The guidance is a range, and we provide a range because obviously there are points within the range that are achievable as things go better and there are points in the range that we achieve if things go worse.","So where we've identified the range is the entire possible range of outcomes, and certainly there's always the opportunity for outperformance. And we're always optimistic about outperformance and certainly don't plan for underperformance.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the United contract renewal, can you give us some color as to where you are in your conversation with United? And also, when we think about the opportunities in the marketplace, I mean, obviously, there are two contracts right now that have national exclusivity, United and Aetna. How should we think about these two opportunities? Are they fairly comparable in size or any other color there?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, obviously, we have been engaged in conversations with United and continue to be, and the conversations have been constructive. And all I'll say is when we have something specific to tell you, we will absolutely tell you.","In terms of Aetna, even over the years that we've been outside of the Aetna contract, we've had a very constructive relationship with them. And so we continue to have discussions with them about the possibility of re-entering that contract when it opens up. I think in terms of membership lives, United is larger than Aetna. So that would at least imply that in terms of dollars spend, United would spend more on lab services than Aetna, but I can't give you much further than that because obviously not being in one of the contracts, we don't have a lot of insight to it.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just lastly on the relationship with Walgreens, I know you made some prepared comments, but can you just kind of like share with us how you are going to choose or how you chose the initial sites and how the strategy do you think will evolve over time? Do you think this is just going to be about specimen collection or you can expand it into other patient care as well?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, the team chose the sites based on availability of space in stores, based on strengths of both businesses, places where both business had strong infrastructures. We're starting with seven sites. We're going to quickly evaluate whether they're successful. We've already had discussions with Walgreens about other opportunities both to expand the patient service center positioning as well as to provide other types of patient care services within those sites and within their stores. So I am very, very excited about this relationship. I think it's a significant step forward. We've said for a long time we want to be in a healthcare environment and we're in one of the premier healthcare environments and so we look forward to updating you on how we progress.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So it's three minutes past the hour and we still have a number of people in the queue. If we could try to just ask one question, please, and if your question has already been asked, really, it's not necessary to ask it again. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, just a real quick follow-up, you guys alluded to kind of a pull-through from early-stage to late-stage work in the Covance business. I don't know if it's possible, but I was curious if there is a way to quantify that and give us a sense if that's something that could be growing now over time or \u2013 because, I guess, in the past those two businesses have been somewhat separate?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. This is John. We analyze the pull through, whether it's from the preclinical tox business into the BioA, into the CMC from the BioA into the lab businesses, into the clinical businesses from Phase I into the II, III, IV. I think it's safe to say slight increases in terms of those. You still have the buyers of early clinical, the buyers of labs, the buyers of clinical and then timing of that, even within pharma, those hurdles obviously still exist.","And then you try to put in pieces of the organization. Our early development segment has a business area, the EPDS (01:02:46) area that actually is a sales, marketing, technical solution that attempts to then bridge those gaps between those organizations. So we're attempting to do that more and more, especially with the oncology portfolios, the immuno-oncology portfolio lends to that, but at the same time, you do have natural hurdles in terms of the \" follow the (01:03:16) molecule\". We do have nice strength in all of the areas and we continue to do business within the individual segments as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I hopped on a little late, so I apologize if this was asked already, but it seems like there's been more activity on the hospital outreach side. Do you think that's PAMA related? Is it pressures the hospitals may be seeing in sort of a need for capital from them? Maybe comment on the pipeline, as maybe it's just a coincidence that these deals seem to be kind of coming up all at the same time. And then remind us, Dave, again, how long do they have to be out of the market for? Is there a specified sort of contract term where they can't do the outreach? Or is it in perpetuity? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think we already commented on the pipeline and the hospital, kind of the approach of the health systems and I would say I don't think it's as much PAMA-driven as it's just the entire environment is changing. I mean value-based care, bundled payments, pay-for-outcomes. So I don't think it's \u2013 PAMA's part of it, but it's certainly not the sole or in my mind even one of the major drivers behind hospital thinking.","And as I say, we commented on the pipeline. Every outreach deal and every partnership deal is different. Our approach is to do strategic deals, so we're not asking people to exit the market; we're asking them to build and strengthen the market with us. So, but that \u2013 but if you're doing an acquisition, there is typically a negotiation around what that means in terms of a non-compete, there's no standard.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everybody. Maybe I'll just ask, in your disclosure around margin trends and Covance the last four or so quarters, there's been this discussion, and I think a couple of quarters ago, it was talk about investment in sales force and research associates. That was in there for a few quarters, and now, the last couple of quarters, it's been including targeted strategic investments to support future growth. What I'm just curious about is, is that just sort of part of the ongoing business? Or are you signaling that there's some elevated level of spending right now that at some point in the future might taper off and thus be margin enhancing? Can you give us a little flavor for what's behind that?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, I think from the standpoint of there has been enhanced investment in the business and whether that's on the therapeutic side or whether that's on the commercial side or the deal-making side, there has been. And then from the vantage point still focused on the organic growth, that'll continue, but look, we need to increase our margins. We, obviously, see the peer level margins that are out there, and so we announced the initial phase of Covance's LaunchPad. It's a three-year program. We first addressed restructurings and facilities, and now we'll move into, really, the re-engineering of our systems, processes, utilizing the new technology and tools focused on improving our productivity. So there is investments that will continue, but there will be margin expansion, and you'll see even the initial part of that in the second half of this year.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And, A.J., to respond specifically to what you asked, I mean, I think John's done a terrific job in investing in enhancing the personnel resources that we have. So that is near-term elevated level of investment that will normalize over time.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jeffries.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Dave, just a quick question since you talked about staying disciplined on valuation for acquisitions, especially in the CRO space. So is this a time that you and the board, you think, should be revisiting dividends or other forms of capital deployment, kind of like increasing the buyback or paying dividend out?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I think, it's very clear that we are committed to buy back and we bought back $100 million worth of shares in the quarter and over $250 million for the year. So I don't think there's going be any question about our commitment, which we made early in the year and have been firm on that we're returning capital to shareholders. No, I don't think it's the time to revisit our approach. I think our approach has been extremely successful. I think when I became CEO of this company, we were about $3 billion in revenue, we're going to be $10 billion in revenue, and we got there by acquiring strategically, by investing in our people and by growing the business organically and we're going to keep doing the same things.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up, John, to Kevin Ellich's question...","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, no, no. We've -.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, I'm sorry, it's almost a quarter after now.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Okay. No worries.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We need to go on. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. A quick one on PAMA. Dave, I'd be interested in your views, if we assume that the current legislation is enacted as expected, if you had a view as to how quickly you think the hospital side of the market will start to take action in light of those reimbursement cuts? And the reason I ask is, I think there was a perception that hospital systems are slow to react, they don't have great visibility or metrics around their lab profitability, so I'm interested in whether or not you think you can see that constituency move relatively quickly once we have some clarity on PAMA, the phase-in. Thank you.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think there's a growing sense of awareness in hospital administration, that PAMA is going to be impactful in 2018. You see that in comments that are being made by hospital executives. I do think, to your question, Isaac, it's hard for hospitals, it's hard for any big organization, I shouldn't limit it to hospitals, it's hard for any big organization to react quickly to change and so I don't know how fast you would see movement in the market or even what that movement would look like. If you look at just health systems generally, there's been a tremendous amount of health system consolidation in the last several years and that seems to be continuing. Health systems continue selectively to acquire physicians. So the market will move, but I don't know that it will move fast.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Massaro with Massaro (sic) [Canaccord Genuity, Inc.] (01:10:49).","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks, guys. We're a couple of days in, but recently there was a start-up direct-to-consumer genomics company that is launching exome sequencing applications. And I wanted to see, Dave, how you handicap maybe the platform opportunity over the next three to five years, whether or not you think this is an area that you may want to participate in given some of the success you're having with 23andMe.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I would say that direct-to-consumer genetics is a very complex area from a regulatory, a legal and an ethical perspective. And so, I think, what you can safely assume is that there'll be a lot of people out there trying it and it will not be a high priority for us. Again, the collaboration with 23andMe provides that direct-to-consumer genetic testing in a highly reputable, well-proven environment, where they've gone to FDA and gotten permission to offer \u2013 to make the claims and offer the interpretations that they do. We're proud of that relationship. And I think it's \u2013 as I say, it's an area that's fraught with challenges.

My name is Katrina, and I\u2019ll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I\u2019d now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Stephen Anderson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Stephen Anderson","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's fourth quarter and full-year 2014 conference call. With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jay Boyle, Chief Executive Officer of LabCorp Diagnostics; Joe Herring, Chief Executive Officer of Covance Drug Development and Paul Surdez, Vice President of Investor Relations.","This morning, we will recap our 2014 performance, discuss our 2015 priorities, provide an update on our Covance acquisition, introduce Project LaunchPad, our enterprise-wide business process improvement initiative and issue our 2015 guidance.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. Please refer to today's press release for replay information.","This morning, the Company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our Web site. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our Web site to review this supplemental information.","Additionally, we refer you to today's press release, which is available on our Web site, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS, free cash flow and adjusted operating income.","I\u2019d also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions.","These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the Company's financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2013 10-K and in our subsequent filings with the SEC and will be included in our 2014 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The Company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve. I\u2019ll start by recapping 2014. We delivered a strong operating performance, exceeding $6 billion in revenue and generating total volume growth including acquisitions of 5.3%. After a challenging first quarter due to extraordinary weather, our performance improved sequentially throughout the year.","In the fourth quarter, revenue increased by 5.3% over the fourth quarter of 2013 and we posted year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, and adjusted EPS. We also achieved strong organic growth in the fourth quarter and for the year. We are very pleased with our 2014 performance.","Late last year, we made a very important strategic movement, the Covance acquisition. This transaction is the culmination of years of thinking about how to best position our Company for the future and I\u2019m very proud of our team for its dedication and tenacity in completing the acquisition.","We have made a transformational move for our Company and over time the combined company will enhance drug development, laboratory diagnostics, and healthcare delivery. This merger creates a unique combination of capabilities that positions the new LabCorp to bring innovative and higher value solutions to clients of both predecessor companies.","We close the Covance acquisition yesterday and we are off to a strong start on the integration of the businesses. Going forward, we will operate in two segments, LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development, which we expect to be closely aligned in furthering our correlation of improving patient's lives by providing world-class diagnostics and knowledge services.","Jay Boyle, who has been exceptional Chief Operating Officer of LabCorp over the last five years, is now Chief Executive Officer of LabCorp Diagnostics. Joe Herring, who has successfully led Covance for over a decade, and has been a great partner since we announced the transaction, is now Chief Executive Officer of Covance Drug Development. Joe and Jay will report to me.","Although the flawless integration of Covance is of utmost importance, I want to emphasize that it will not cause us to lose focus on the 2015 priorities for LabCorp Diagnostics, which include these three clear initiatives. First, we will continue to focus on opportunities to grow in both core and esoteric testing. We will build on our strong 2014 performance in organic growth, managed care contracting, new test introductions, and strategic acquisitions. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the lab industry and our laboratory business.","Second, we will continue to make progress with our innovative products and services. The Beacon LBS team is pushing toward its goal of full implementation. Enlighten Health continues to expand, having launched ExomeReveal, the genome wide interpretation service and recently introduced an innovative patient friendly diabetes report that graphically displays results.","Third, to complement our focus on top line growth, we\u2019ve systematically reviewed our business and operating model to see where we can improve our performance. Project LaunchPad is the Company\u2019s enterprise-wide business process improvement initiative. It consists of projects designed to reengineer the Company\u2019s systems and processes, leverage technological advancements, and make sustainable reductions in our cost base.","LaunchPad is not a short-term cost-cutting measure. It is a long-term structural change in how we deliver our services. We are pursuing projects that will fundamentally improve the experience of everyone involved in the LabCorp diagnostics value chain from provider to customer to payer to our valued employees. We expect this initiative to drive net savings in excess of a $150 million over the next three years. Glenn will provide additional details on LaunchPad in a few minutes.","Now let me update you on the Covance acquisition, which will deliver new services to the pharmaceutical industry, drive share gains in both the diagnostics and drug development businesses and benefit healthcare stakeholders and our shareholders. Our new combined company has a strong management team, relationships with nearly every major player in the healthcare industry, a global footprint and a unique wealth of data.","With these assets, we expect to win a greater share of clinical trials, enhance and grow our market leading central lab business, deliver on expanded range of diagnostic offerings, and accelerate profitable growth in the years ahead.","I'll now discuss three immediate growth opportunities. First, we will use our unique combination of assets and data to deliver faster clinical trial enrollment. Patient recruitment is an inefficient process, combining LabCorp\u2019s database of more than 70 million unique patient records with Covance\u2019s investigator database and analytic capabilities, positions us to deliver faster, higher quality clinical trials, significantly reduce clinical trial cycle time, eliminate nonviable sites which can significantly delay recruitment, reduce costs and ultimately enable our Biopharma clients to reach peak revenue for their new products faster.","Second, we will become the partner of choice to develop and commercialize companion diagnostics. There are over 100 companion diagnostics on the market today, versus 13 in 2006. More than 20% of 2014 drug approvals were personalized medicines and there are dozens of drugs in Phase 3 development that will require companion diagnostics.","Combining Covance\u2019s strength in central lab and early development with LabCorp\u2019s strength in assay development and test commercialization will create the only company in the world that can offer comprehensive end-to-end support for companion diagnostics development.","Third, we will enhance the Phase IV trial experience and post-market surveillance. Approximately 30% of Phase IV patients drop out due to inconvenient trial procedures and a limited number of trials sites. LabCorp\u2019s 750 patient service centers approximately 5,000 phlebotomist and physician offices and convenient patient web portal for scheduling can improve the Phase IV patient experience.","LabCorp\u2019s infrastructure will serve another important function, allowing the combined organization to collect post-approval safety data on new drugs. More than 25 approved drugs have been withdrawn from the market in recent years, the vast majority due to toxicity. Our combined analytics capabilities will give us the potential to identify early safety signals, avoid extensive recalls, and find genotypic characteristics of patients who experience adverse drug reactions, so that the drug can be given to patients for whom it is safe.","How our organizations will also be able to use these capabilities to assist Biopharma companies through post-market studies in understanding how drugs are being used by physicians and identifying new locations where those new indications where those drugs show efficacy.","We expect these three opportunities to generate over $300 million in incremental revenue by 2018. In addition, we see exciting opportunities to expand our Food Safety and Nutritional Chemistry Services and longer term to grow through international expansion and predictive analytics for providers and payers.","We are off to a strong start, as evidenced by a biotech client that recently awarded a sizeable clinical study to Covance. This award was based in part on the potential of deploying LabCorp testing data, to identify patients with rare genetic mutations, speeding enrollment in the clinical trial for its personalized oncology drug.","There are number of new opportunities where LabCorp testing data is being used to support a Covance bid, and we expect our patient data and connectivity to continue to enhance and further differentiate Covance\u2019s drug development capabilities.","Before we -- I turn the call over to Glenn; I want to express my appreciation to LabCorp\u2019s 36,000 employees for delivering an outstanding year in 2014, despite difficult circumstances. Our senior leadership team including our operational leadership, our sales and service team, our phlebotomist, our couriers, and our technical staff are the best in our industry and it is a privilege to lead them. I thank each of you for your hard work, your dedication to patient care, and your performance in 2014 and every year.","I also want to welcome Covance\u2019s 12,500 talented employees to our Company, as I know they will join with the LabCorp team in making important contributions to our future successes. This is an exciting time to be at LabCorp and I'm confident that our team will enhance drug development, diagnostic services, and the delivery of healthcare to better address the need to improve patient outcomes at lower costs.","Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results and 2015 guidance, followed by an update on our Covance acquisition and Project LaunchPad initiative.","Sales for the quarter were approximately $1.5 billion, an increase of 5.3% over last year. The increase in sales was the result of volume, measured by requisitions and acquisitions, partially offset by price mix and currency. The growth in sales was due to organic volume of 5.3%, partially offset by a decline in revenue for requisitions of 1.1% and negative impact of currency of 0.5%. In addition, acquisitions added 1.6% to sales.","Total volume including acquisitions increased 6.4%. The decline in revenue per acquisition was primarily due to core support testing growth, outpacing esoteric testing growth and less revenue generated from uninsured patients.","Gross profit for the quarter was $546 million or 36.1% of sales. This compares to gross profit of $526 million or 36.6% of sales last year. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to volume, productivity, and acquisitions, partially offset by price mix, cost inflation and depreciation. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to the changes in test and payer mix that I mentioned earlier.","SG&A for the quarter was $310 million or 20.5% of sales compared to $286 million or 19.9% last year. During the quarter, we incurred $13 million of special charges in SG&A relating to Project LaunchPad and the Company\u2019s acquisition of Covance. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to personnel costs, acquisitions and an increase in bad debt expense. While bad debt increased due to sales growth, the rate improved 10 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect this rate to be lower in 2015.","During the quarter, we had $2 million of restructuring and special items, compared to $4 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced severance costs, partially offset by an increase in facility related costs.","Operating income for the quarter was $219 million or 14.5% of sales compared to $215 million or 15% of sales last year. Excluding restructuring and special items of $16 million, adjusted operating income was $235 million or 15.5% of sales compared to $219 million or 15.2% of sales last year.","Interest expense for the quarter was $32 million compared to $24 million last year. The increase was primarily driven by Covance related financing costs of approximately $6 million.","The tax rate for the quarter was 36.1% compared to 34.8% last year. The increase in the tax rate over last year was the result of benefits related to discrete items realized in the fourth quarter of 2013. As a result, net earnings for the quarter were $120 million or $1.39 per diluted share compared to $126 million or $1.43 per diluted share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS was $1.65 in the fourth quarter, up from $1.61 in the fourth quarter of 2013.","During the quarter, operating cash flow was $214 million compared to $249 million last year, as we used working capital to support strong top line growth and incurred cash costs relating to Project LaunchPad and the Covance acquisition.","Capital expenditures totaled $46 million, compared to $60 million last year. As a result, free cash flow or operating cash flow after capital expenditures was $167 million compared to $189 million last year.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $39 million of our stock, bringing our 2014 total share repurchases to $269 million. With the November 3rd announcement of the Covance acquisition, we suspended our share repurchase program until we reach our targeted leverage.","Now I\u2019ll cover our guidance for 2015. Total revenue was expected to grow 40% to 44% inclusive of Covance as of February 19, and after adjusting for approximately 160 basis points of negative currency impact as we\u2019ve assumed that foreign exchange rate stay at January 31, 2015 levels.","Our LabCorp Diagnostic business is expected to grow 3% to 5%. Covance\u2019s revenue is expected to increase approximately 4% to 6% versus full-year 2014 after adjusting for approximately 330 basis points of negative currency impact.","Given our expected top line growth, Project LaunchPad initiative and the acquisition of Covance, our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance is $7.35 to $7.70, an increase of 8% to 13% versus the prior year. Included in this estimate is expected accretion from Covance of approximately $0.35 to $0.40.","We expect to have approximately 102 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2015 after issuing 15.3 million shares for the Covance acquisition. In 2015, we expect the Company\u2019s interest and amortization expense to be approximately $220 million and $165 million respectively. In addition, we expect the Company\u2019s tax rate to be approximately 35%.","2015 operating cash flow was expected to be between $1.075 billion and $1.1 billion with capital expenditures between $325 million and $350 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be between $725 million and $775 million, up from $536 million in 2014. The increased free cash flow reflects higher earnings, the Covance acquisition, and improved working capital.","In addition, free cash flow is burdened by approximately $90 million of net nonrecurring items relating to the Covance acquisition. These items include advisory fees, the make whole payment on Covance\u2019s notes, and changing control payments, partially offset by paying only one of the semiannual interest payments on the acquisition debt in 2015.","Now I'll talk about the Covance acquisition. The transaction allows us to bring decades of experience in lab operations and efficiency to Covance\u2019s global central laboratory network, while unlocking greater economic value from our patient database, customer relationships, and commercial infrastructure. The combination also creates new sources of revenue and earnings and expands our customer base and international presence. This acquisition provides us with both near-term and long-term strategic and financial benefits.","At closing, we paid approximately $5.7 billion for Covance, net of cash required. To finance the acquisition, we raised $3.9 billion in long-term debt and issued 15.3 million shares of LabCorp common stock to Covance shareholders. We recently issued $3.9 billion of acquisition related debt at a blended interest rate of approximately 3.2% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 12 years.","These attractive terms reflects strong demand for LabCorp credit as well as a favorable interest rate environment. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet. Both S&P and Moody's have rated our debt as investment grade at BBB and BAA2, respectively. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program until we reach our targeted leverage of 2.5 times debt to EBITDA and expect to allocate our free cash flow towards the pay down of debt and tuck-in acquisition.","The integration of Covance is also well underway. We created numerous functional and business unit teams to foster cross company communication and to facilitate a smooth integration process. We expect to achieve net cost synergies in excess of a $100 million within three years, primarily through central lab consolidation, elimination of redundant public company costs and procurement savings with associated one-time costs to achieve these synergies of approximately $50 million. Net cost synergies in 2015 are expected to be approximately $35 million with associated one-time costs of approximately $20 million.","I\u2019m going to end my comments on our Project LaunchPad initiative. As Dave discussed, LaunchPad is designed to reengineer our systems and processes, improve productivity, and deliver sustained margin improvement over time.","Project LaunchPad savings will favorably impact both gross profit and SG&A through improved customer to cash processes, bad debt reduction, outsourcing, procurement savings, and labor efficiency. We expect this initiative to drive a net savings in excess of $150 million over the next three years with associated one-time cost of approximately $30 million. In 2015, we expect net savings of approximately $50 million with associated one-time cost of approximately $15 million.","This ends our formal remarks, and now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Glenn. I want to announce that after five years of leading LabCorp Investor Relations, Steve Anderson, will transition after this call to an operational role in our Food Safety business, one of the areas where we see great opportunity. Steve has been a terrific IR leader and has worked tirelessly to meet the needs of our analysts and shareholders. I will miss him greatly in this role, but I know he is moving into an area for which he has great and enduring passion.","Paul Surdez, who has led Covance\u2019s Investor Relations program since 2002, will serve as Vice President of Investor Relations for LabCorp. I greatly look forward to working with Paul, who is already recognized as one of the top IR leaders in healthcare services.","Now, we\u2019re ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby representing Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby","Hi, Dave. I guess Steve Anderson and food safety doesn\u2019t really jive with his biscuit bill focus, but I defer to you on that decision. But you\u2019ve mentioned substantial savings from the Project LaunchPad initiatives. Can you speak to any -- there seemed to be a reference to the bad debt coming down, but what are the working capital opportunities? Can we see receivable balances shrink meaningfully there? And any kind of CapEx savings we might expect over the next few years to add to whatever you\u2019re doing from an income statement perspective?","David P. King","Yes. Bob, good morning. From a CapEx perspective, the focus of the LaunchPad initiatives will largely be around improving our systems and operations through technological investments. So although I wouldn't expect to see extraordinary CapEx investments, I would expect to see transitioning some of our ongoing infrastructure CapEx into a more streamlined and efficient processes and systems over time. And some of that will also be reflected as I mentioned in labor efficiency. I\u2019d like Glenn to take the working capital part of the question.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Sure. To your point, working capital has been, call it a use of cash for us, but primarily due to the strong growth that we have experienced in the Company. When you reference kind of our receivables on the absolute level, we actually feel we\u2019ve been managing it quite well. It stayed at roughly 49 days overall. Having said that, a big part of LaunchPad initiative is our working capital improvement, inclusive of a bad debt, but effectively we're looking at really a redesign. So we are going to step back and look at what processes can we put in place that would be preferred, and then as Dave said the put systems to enable that to happen is opposed to just kind of a marginal improvement in that. So from our perspective, we expect to see improved working capital management. We expect to see also a reduction in our bad debt expense, in particularly, our bad debt rate, which we saw some favorable movement already, but we expect to see much greater improvement as we go through the rest of 2015.","Robert Willoughby","But Glenn, you quantified the savings though -- from an income statement, can you quantify any potential free cash flow run rate that we might benefit from or its just too early to put a number around the CapEx and working capital opportunity?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Well again, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily do it as part of those programs, its part of -- it\u2019s embedded in the overall result or the guidance that we\u2019ve given. So when you look at our cash flow number for 2015, when you take the midpoint of the guidance, we\u2019re looking at as a combined company of around $750 million and we talked about the fact that, that\u2019s already been burdened by around $90 million of one-time costs. So you can see the strong improvement in our free cash flow is in part due to the synergies of the acquisition, in part due to the improvement in working capital because of LaunchPad and because of the improved reduction in bad debt expense relating to that LaunchPad initiative as well. So that\u2019s all encompassed in that number.","David P. King","And Bob, it\u2019s Dave. I would just also say over time, what we like to see is the investments that we make in systems now allowing us to reduce CapEx in the out years. So I do expect some positive benefit to the overall level of CapEx as a result of LaunchPad.","Robert Willoughby","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Bonello representing Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.","Bill Bonello","Hey, good morning guys. Just two quick questions. One is just a simple numbers question. You talked about currency reducing revenue by about a 160 basis points in 2015. How should we think about the hit to EPS?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Obviously, reflected in the guidance that we have as well. The biggest hit -- currency headwinds, if you will, obviously with Covance having over half of their business overseas, that's where we see it. And so, when we provided the guidance range of Covance kind of year-over-year as if we would have them for both years, you can see it was around 3.3 points. So that would get you to call it in the mid $70 million, if you will, of headwind on sales. Historically, Covance is leveraged at around -- call it around a 20% degradational to their mark -- to their earnings. So again, as part of LabCorp, that translates to around call it 1.5% of headwind on the top line and again if you use that roughly 20% margin degradation, you would probably get a good proxy for the earnings impact, which again is reflected in the guidance that we provided.","Bill Bonello","Okay, perfect. Great. And then, just on the recent contract that you talked about being awarded, and Covance talked about this as well. Dave, I\u2019m wondering if you can just give us a little bit more color about sort of the process. So you mentioned that you are going to use lab data to identify patients, but maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on how does that actually play out and how beneficial that can be? Because I think it's an area where there is still some skepticism about how that really can drive improvement in patient recruitment?","David P. King","Okay. So I'm going to -- I'll start and then I\u2019m going to ask Joe to comment as well. In this specific case, the Biopharma client was looking for a very specific -- a set of patients with a very specific characteristic to test a personalized oncology drug in their trial. We went into our data of the testing that we had done, I believe over the last couple of years and looked at the number of patients that we had seen that met those very specific criteria and we showed the client that this is a built-in recruitment set where we know who these patients are and we know where they are. And I want to be clear, Bill, that that was part of the client's decision. The Covance team had positioned us to be in great shape. At the final stages, I think it was down to two CROs that they were considering. So this was part of the calculation. It was not a last minute Hail Mary pass into the end zone that brought us back from the brink of not being involved. We were very well positioned. This was incrementally something that was considered to be a value. How we would then execute this is, for those patients who we have a direct relationship with, who have consented to be re-contacted for whatever reason, we would be able to re-contact them. For those patients who have not consented to be re-contacted or who we don't have a direct relationship with, we would go to the physician, indicate to the physician that they have X number of patients who they are treating, who would be eligible for this very important study and leave it to the physician to recruit the patients or to seek the patients whether the patients are interested in being recruited. So that's kind of how it works in practice. Joe, further comments?","Joe Herring","Well, I think Dave has done a pretty good job describing that. I was actually met with the CEO of this client during the JP Morgan conference and as Dave said, this is a highly specialized personalized medicine drug in non-small cell lung cancer and the CEO was very concerned about finding patients for the study. And we have talked about the historic sort of Covance approach to this and he seems pretty comfortable, but a competitor have an equally compelling sort of an offer. But when he understood the generic -- genetic marker he was looking for, we said let us see if we can look into the LabCorp database and give you an idea how to find the patients for this study and we\u2019re looking for about little over a 100 patients, and he said this trial has to be recruited. He said we are going to make a decision next week and I\u2019d be happy to hear what you say about the LabCorp data. I had our Chief Medical Officer with us, he worked with LabCorp and 12 hours later we assured the client and said there are over a 1,000 patients in the LabCorp database that fit the inclusion, exclusion and genetic marker for this study. And they call the next day and awarded a $45 million study. I would say there was less than -- roughly 50-50 percent chance we were going to win, and a week later to get it that next morning was pretty awesome. And we have about five other clients right now that we are working with on a similar basis. So I guess as of today we are one for one utilizing the combination of LabCorp data and Covance clinical talents.","Bill Bonello","That was as good of an explanation as I could have possibly hoped for. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill representing JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Gill","Congrats and good morning. Steve, I really enjoyed working with you and I appreciate all your help over the last few years. So my question really is first, Dave, when you talked about these unique opportunities in the $300 million revenue opportunity by 2018 and clearly Joe just talked about this most recent one at $45 million. Can you maybe give us an indication of how you expect that $300 million over the next couple of years? Are you expecting anything in 2015?","David P. King","Well, Lisa, good morning and thanks for the nice comments about Steve and obviously I know many analysts and shareholders have enjoyed working with him. I have enjoyed working with him and the team as well. He is not disappearing, he is just going over to Food Safety and we\u2019re thrilled to have Paul to step in. And I think you will really enjoy working with Paul. So with that said, what we anticipate for 2015 is built into the guidance and as you know we don't break the guidance out into specific parts and pieces. I would expect this to be as Joe said, we are one for one. We are going to have to prove the case that not only can we marshal the data, but then it actually increases the speed of recruiting -- of patient recruitment. So I would expect this to start relatively slowly and then if we are right, we would expect it to build in 2016 and 2017 and come out at 2018 as we\u2019ve identified $300 million as the target for all three of the initiatives combined. But I think that that the opportunity there is real and if we prove the case it\u2019s significant.","Lisa Gill","And then my second question is really around your core lab business and the guidance that you gave for next year, talking about this year, the offsets was price mix, currency et cetera. But as we think about 2015, can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing right now from reimbursement environment, especially in the commercial market? Do you have anything that was of size [ph] that was up for renewal and generally speaking what are you seeing from a reimbursement perspective?","David P. King","I would say Lisa in terms of year-over-year reimbursement, what we are assuming in the guidance is that MoPath remains about the same that we have some incremental opportunity with BRCA particularly. I think everybody knows that the uncertainty now is around reimbursement for the clinical toxicology, so the Palmetto limited coverage decision which has been delayed until April, but it's still I would -- I think it's fair to say being vigorously debated between the lab industry and the payer community and then how that will ripple through with managed care combined with the impact of new toxicology codes, many of which still have not been loaded into payer system. So generally the reimbursement environment looks better than it has in the last couple of years, but as always we are in a rapidly changing regulatory and reimbursement environment and we need to take that into account and how we think about the business.","Lisa Gill","And just so that I understand that so, should we assume that within the guidance rage there is varying assumptions as to how these things will play out in 2015?","David P. King","Yes, the guidance contemplates a wide range of outcomes and we have attempted to incorporate these various potential outcomes into the range that we\u2019ve given.","Lisa Gill","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman representing Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Gary Lieberman","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, thank you for all the help over the years, it\u2019s been great working with you. I guess my first question is around the LaunchPad, $150 million in savings that equals about 175 basis points of margin expansion. So, would you expect to see that margin expansion or should we consider that there might continue to be some headwinds that would offset at least part of that?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Well, this is Glenn, let me take it first, and Dave may want to chime in as well. When we talk about the initiative, we talk about it on a net savings basis. And while we say that they\u2019re onetime costs, if you back that out we\u2019ve looked at the initiative, we\u2019ve looked at what it would take to effectively take that kind of cost out of the company net of the cost that we need to support it. So, if you looked at it in isolation obviously that\u2019s a benefit that will occlude to the company. So, as we go forward though our goal is to continue to drive our top line, to continue to manage the business to drive operating improvement as we go forward and LaunchPad is clearly one of the initiatives that we have that will help to drive that income and margin improvement.","David P. King","Gary, its Dave, just -- I think the only thing I would add to that is, we\u2019re very focused on margin improvement. And LaunchPad is a significant opportunity for us to improve margins over time. The thing that obviously we cannot predict is going back to Lisa\u2019s question, what's the reimbursement environment two years out, three years out? And so all of the things being equal, yes, I would expect LaunchPad to translate to margin improvement, but we can't guide to where we are going to be based on factors that we don\u2019t know about yet.","Gary Lieberman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just update us on the reception of the deal, and closing the deal by the Covance employees, you characterized it previously to sort of being almost transparent to them and do you still view it that way?","David P. King","Yes, I have spent a lot of time with both the Covance executive team and with the employees at town halls and in meetings and then getting to know them and, my perception is the reception has been terrific. People are very enthusiastic. They seek the opportunity here. They see the long-term potential for both, for our combined company to excel. And I would say, my sense is that\u2019s exactly the same reception on the LabCorp side. People are very enthusiastic about this deal. Joe, any further color?","Joe Herring","Yes, I would characterize it as overwhelmingly for Covance employees, its business as usual certainly in the short-term. But with very exciting strategic prospects, the LabCorp assets made Covance a stronger and more resourceful competitor which makes us a better company. So, if you think about our central lab, now all of a sudden we have more than a $100 million in revenue from LabCorp, and largely esoteric tests that make our business stronger. And the combination makes us the most resourceful, most capable companion diagnostics company in the health care industry. And our employees who want to improve patient care see that as a nice opportunity. For clinical, there is no overlap with LabCorp, so its business as usual, except now you have access to a longitudinal database of $70 million patients, and we already talked about that. In Covance market access, where our number one issue is how to keep post -- patients in post marketing studies on study to achieve the results. The 1,700 centers in the U.S. for LabCorp will make it much easier for those patients to complete their therapy and complete the study. For food service, this is going to be a disruptive offer and just incredibly exciting, and you\u2019ll hear more about that in the future. And then in early development, we pick up a very nice bioanalytical business in terms of tandem, and make us a much stronger biomarker development company. So, there is not a lot of overlap, so this is not terribly disruptive. But where there is overlap, there is exciting strategic advantage. And I guess, what I would close with is just a comment about Dave. Dave, and I have traveled around the world with Covance, have been in front of 1000s of employees in multiple sites as well as small working groups. And I think I can represent the Covance employees saying that they love to see Dave\u2019s passion around improving patient care and health care. They are excited to see how comfortable he is in a lab environment. And finally, I think his interpersonal approach has been very well received by Covance employees around the world. I personally held a town hall meeting yesterday in Princeton with about a 1000 employees, and I can tell you the atmosphere was electric.","Gary Lieberman","Great. A final quick question, in the example you gave where you said you could go to the physician and say that they had X number of patients that met their criteria. Can you actually give the physician the name of the specific patients?","David P. King","I\u2019m going to differ that to legal consideration. I believe that yes, we can because I believe it fits within the hip a [ph] exception for health care treatment. But obviously before we would do that, and by the way, this has been done in situations in the past before we would do that, we would make sure that we had legal approval to actually provide the patient names.","Gary Lieberman","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Joe Herring","I was just going to say, the good news in this is as I walked away from this exciting win, I keep scratching my head thinking, what other organization on the planet can bring this resources? And it\u2019s hard to come up with one, and I like our chances.","Gary Lieberman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny representing Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Michael Cherny","Good morning, everyone. Steve, first of all good luck in the new role, and Paul looking forward to continuing to work together, so happy to see that transition. In terms of thinking about the combination, I know this is still early days and then, given that the deal just closed yesterday, but maybe a question for Joe. You talked about the employee reaction, you talked about the new deal you won which is great to see. How has been the rest of the customer reaction to this deal? In terms of have you spend time with them over the last few months as you\u2019ve gone through some of the renewal or sale processes, obviously Covance delivered very strong 4Q results, a good book to bill. Can you talk a little bit qualitatively about what the pharma sponsors have been telling you guys relative to the power of this deal outside of the one customer that you did win?","Joe Herring","I guess two words comes to mind, the first is intrigued. This is a combination that dirty people had thought of, and initially its where did this come from? But when they think about the combination they start asking us questions. Can you help us with adherence programs? Can you help us with companion diagnostics? It seems like you guys have very unique assets. So, I think intrigued, and I think the second point is comforted. Because what we can say is, there\u2019s not a lot of overlap here. So you can have the same project manager. You are going to have the same study director. It\u2019s going to be the same bill, its going to still say Covance. And so, there\u2019s no disruption here. And if a competitor tries to show up and say, boy this is going to be really disruptive. We pre-trained our clients to say, what do mean disruptive? I have got the same study director, the same sales person, the same everything. And frankly they\u2019ve got some pretty exciting new things to talk about. So, I like our chances.","Michael Cherny","Thanks, Joe. And then, one quick question I guess, for Glenn and maybe Dave as well. When you first announced the deal, I think you had talked about the capital deployment. Obviously your focus has been debt pay down, but that wouldn\u2019t stop you or preclude you in any way from doing any small tuck-ins that may come across that are a nice fit to either side of the business. Is that correct? I just want to make sure I understand the capital deployment priorities.","David P. King","Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Dave. I agree as I think we indicated a couple of places in our prepared remarks, we intend to deploy our capital towards pay down of debt and tuck-in acquisitions. So you\u2019re exactly right.","Michael Cherny","Probably I missed the tuck-in thing, so thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor representing Citi. Please proceed.","Gary Taylor","I would go to the one question right before I get to go, I see \u2026","David P. King","You got one follow-up.","Gary Taylor","Okay, I\u2019ll stretch for the follow-up. I do have a follow-up that\u2019s related. I just want to walk through -- kind of walk through the guidance and get your response to something, just see something about it correctly. So, basically the cash earnings guidance $735 million to $770 million, Covance accretion is $0.35 to $0.40 that gets you to kind of $7 or $7.30. LaunchPad is supposed to be 50 million bucks, that\u2019s about $0.30. So it kind of put the core lab business to kind of $6.70 to $7 versus $6.80 this year. Obviously there is no share repurchase included in that. So, it feels relatively flattish for the core lab business but obviously volumes -- organic volume and revenue has picked up. And as you said, you\u2019re lapping some of the largest Medicare reimbursement cut. So, am I thinking about that correctly and if so, why such a conservative take kind of on the core earnings power in the lab business?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yes, Gary, this is Glenn; let me at least start off to your point. When you back out the mid points of the accretion that we expect to get from Covance you kind of get to that 7.15\u2019ish number for what would have been our base business compared to $6.80. So kind of growing at around 5% kind of consistent with what we said kind of the top line growth. So from our perspective as we go into \u201915 with our base business, we are looking at good top line growth organically. We are looking at an improvement in operating income. We are looking at an improvement in our operating margins. And again to your point we\u2019re driving that 15% or a 5% EPS growth which again is faster growth than just the top line without any capital redeployment. So the significant amount of free cash flow that we have that would normally have gone into our share repurchases obviously have gone into the acquisition of Covance, that\u2019s adding that call it 35% to 40% of accretion. So from our perspective LaunchPad is an integral part just of the ongoing continuous improvement initiative of our business, but it should be viewed as part of our base business and we think actually the improvement in our profitability as well as the improvement in our cash flow in \u201915 on the base business is quite strong.","Gary Taylor","Now, that\u2019s fair. I understand its part of the base business, but it is new and fairly material and highlighted and a very material portion of the growth in the lab business year-over-year \u2026","David P. King","Yes, Garry, it\u2019s Dave. I think the other thing to mention, and I just want to be clear, we\u2019re not going to break down every bit and piece of the guidance because there are many, many moving pieces. We talked about currency earlier. But also remember that within the $6.80 this year we had $0.11 onetime gain from the share, the sale of some shares of a company that we owned. So, there are many, many things that are incorporate into the number that we turned in and the guidance that we produced. And I just -- I want to be cautious about trying to back out every piece of it and figure out what's up, what's down and what's not changing.","Gary Taylor","Yes, that\u2019s fair. I just kind of big picture what you think of lab. My one follow-up would be, when you announced the Covance deal you suggested $100 million in cost synergies over three years. I know you didn\u2019t carve that out today. But would you be willing to say, what's kind of embedded for \u201915 in terms of cost synergies?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Gary, this is Glenn. We actually did break it out. We had talked about in excess of $100 million of synergy savings over the three-year period, so consistent with what we\u2019ve said when we announced the transaction. When we have added further is that we expect that the 2015 piece of it would generate around $35 million of net savings while incurring around onetime cost of around $20 million. And the main components again consistent with what we would have shared at the time of the announcement was a combination of synergies through the lab consolidation, through the taking out the redundant public company cost as well as leveraging the purchasing power of the combined company.","Gary Taylor","Okay. I\u2019m sorry I missed that. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy representing William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda Murphy","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just actually a follow-up to Lisa\u2019s question on the revenue synergy numbers that you guys have put together. Just curious if you can give a little more detail around, I know it\u2019s early but the methodology you went through to get to those numbers. I\u2019m just trying to think through what the risk might be there other than just obviously the ramp, and then also, you\u2019re not to get greedy but where we might potentially see some upside to those numbers given the greater the ensign [ph] that you had included there?","David P. King","Amanda, its Dave. The methodology was that we went through the three opportunities we looked at what we thought based on historical trends and how we size the opportunities was an appropriate breakdown. And then we said, we think number one is the largest. We think number two is in the middle, and we think number three is the smallest. And the numbers that approximately around that are 150, 150 and you add those together then they are 300. Obviously we wouldn\u2019t have put the greater sign if we didn\u2019t feel that there was upside to those 300. But we\u2019ve given a number that we think is very realistic. We have given a breakdown of how we think those revenue opportunities would materialize, and where we think the greater opportunities are. And we did it all with financial analysis of past results of our company, and Covance and market size and market share and opportunities for gain. So, I don\u2019t really know how to break it down in much more detail than that. But I hope that answers the question.","Amanda Murphy","Yes, thank you. And then just one more here, it\u2019s a little more specific I guess, but obviously LabCorp has had an increased growth in opportunity and through Next-Gen Sequencing based test et cetera. Just curious, I know that there is some efforts to set some reimbursement there via Medicare. Have you guys saw through there what the risk might be just obviously given some of the issues with MoPath codes a year-ago or so, is there a risk to the reimbursement for Next-Gen? I know it\u2019s early and we\u2019re setting the infrastructure now, but just curious of your thoughts there.","David P. King","I think it\u2019s very early to comment on that. There are a lot of discussions going on with Medicare, with Palmetto specifically about Next-Gen Sequencing and appropriate reimbursement for Next-Gen Sequencing, and we\u2019re very much engaged in those discussions as are, by the way a lot of other companies that have a significant interest in how Next-Gen Sequencing will be reimbursed. Next-Gen Sequencing provides revolutionary opportunities to deliver greater knowledge to physicians and patients and to improve patient care. And it would be a shame if we shortsightedly set reimbursement in such a way that we discourage patients and physicians from using the best tools available to deliver optimal outcomes.","Amanda Murphy","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen representing Raymond James & Associates. Please proceed.","Nicholas Jansen","Hey guys, nice quarter and good guidance. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the regulatory outlook. We haven\u2019t heard anything much on kind of the timing of the 2017 regs coming out also with LDT regulation and with the doc segs [ph] upcoming. I just wanted to get your broader thoughts on the macro from a Medicare perspective. Thanks.","David P. King","Back in my legal days I would have objected to that as a three part question, one question, but I\u2019ll answer it. Good morning, Nicholas. How you\u2019re doing? It\u2019s Dave. Okay, Palma still very much engaged with CMS on how the surveys will be done. I think we\u2019ve made some constructive progress with them on thinking about how the surveys will be done. The inclusion of hospitals in the survey data don\u2019t have any update on the timing of when we might expect that to come out. I think to their credit, CMS is recognized the complexity of the task, and is working very hard to try to device a fair process. Lab Developed Tests, we continue to have the same view that we previously articulated that we do not believe that FDA has legal authority to regulate LDTs as medical devices. We don\u2019t believe they are medical devices. We think they are extremely important to the practice of medicine and to meeting patient needs, and we think that what FDA has proposed would be contrary not only to the public interest in the language of the statute, but also to sound public policy. FDA has had a listening meeting. I think there were a wide variety of views expressed about the LDT guidance. And I think it continues to be an area of high interest and high focus for the clinical lab industry. And it continues to be something that we at LabCorp feel very, very strongly about. So, those are the two major regulatory issues that I think we have on the table in front of us, and I hope that responds efficiently to your question.","Nicholas Jansen","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo representing Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just go back to the synergy topic for a second and looking at Covance\u2019s filings, it looks like they historically had north of $40 million alone in just stock comp expense before thinking about other public company cost, and then you\u2019re guiding to only $35 million and I know that not all of the stock comp goes away as you lock down some of the key Covance employees. So that\u2019s not a bucket where everything goes to zero, but nonetheless $35 million sounds a little bit on the conservative side when we look at some of the opportunities out there. So could you maybe give us a sense of where the majority of the $35 million comes from this year?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Sorry, Whit this is Glenn. And I think the key point that you said this year, we\u2019re looking at synergy savings on the cost side of around in excess of a $100 as we go through the process and that doesn\u2019t include any of the revenue synergies that Dave and Joe had already spoke to. When you look at the -- we gave the first year piece of it so, and frankly it will probably trend to be call it roughly around a third year as we get over that $100 million number. But in the current year, as you would imagine that the biggest piece of those cost savings will come from the redundant public company cost that we have, because we can take that out right away. We will get some benefit from leveraging of the purchasing power of our combined company as well as with the lab consolidation we\u2019ll get some. But the later two, the purchasing, the lab consolidation are benefits that will obviously accrue and take a little bit longer to achieve over the nest couple of years. So, we view that overall the synergies of the combination are good on the cost side, the revenue side, let alone the expected growth in both of our businesses.","David P. King","And Whit, it\u2019s Dave. Just to follow-up on that, I think you\u2019re right that the stock comp expense is in area that we continue to look at. Obviously all of the stock comp is not going to go away, but there are likely to be some changes in stock comp issuance for this year. I just want to remind everybody that is a non-cash saving. So, it doesn\u2019t translate into cash flow and it doesn\u2019t translate into cash flow guidance. But it\u2019s still a savings in terms of overall expense nonetheless.","Whit Mayo","Is there a number to think about for what the new stock comp expense should be for the entire company?","David P. King","We don\u2019t guide the stock comp expense and so, no there\u2019s no number to think about there.","Whit Mayo","Okay. Now that\u2019s fair. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Glen Santangelo","Thanks for the question. Glenn, I just want to follow-up on some of the comments you just made earlier about FX, because if we look at the top line guidance for Covance, you obviously called out specifically how big that was. But sort of given the many moving parts and geographic locations for Covance, could you help us think about the operating profit growth particularly as it relates to any FX, headwinds or tailwinds within that number? And obviously there is a piece of the Sanofi deal that\u2019s going away late in the fourth quarter. So I\u2019m just trying to directionally think about that operating profit growth relative to the revenue number you provided. Thanks.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Sure, Glen. And again, I think we may have already addressed that in an earlier question. We did give you kind of the top line impact from the currency headwinds, and Covance has three principal areas of currency exposure. Obviously they are in 60 countries, but between the Euro zone, the Swiss and UK if you will it\u2019s primarily where that exposure comes in. So we talked about it roughly call it 330 basis points of negative impact give or take that\u2019s in the mid 70s if you will at the revenue line negatively impacting what we believe Covance will see in sales, is if the currency level stay at basically the current levels today and we\u2019ve talked about that the impact on operating income at least historically for them would be plus or minus around GP a little bit lower than that. So we saw 20% is probably a good proxy where you would want to model that.","Glen Santangelo","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ricky Goldwasser","Hi, good morning, and Steve congratulations on the new role, its really well deserved, and Paul congratulations for you as well. So the question and I\u2019ll have a follow-up as well. Dave, can you just talk to us a little bit about kind of like your -- kind of when you think about kind of like the top line guidance for LabCorp standalone. How do you think about kind of like the utilization environment in 2015, and kind of like that price to volume makes it, that\u2019s embedded in the guidance?","David P. King","I think the utilization environment just based on the numbers that we saw sequentially in 2014 Ricky has improved, obviously very pleased with 5% plus top line volume growth in the fourth quarter. How do we think about price volume next year? I think we think about relatively similar volume numbers, maybe to be realistic we obviously had very strong year-over-year performance. So, while we don\u2019t guide specifically to price and volume I would think a reasonable assumption is volume growth stays about where it is and pricing is relatively flat and maybe down a little bit just depending on the fact so we can identify which are core testing in the fourth quarter outpacing esoteric and movement from uninsured -- the uninsured patient bucket into insured or exchange bucket. So I don\u2019t think next year would look a lot different from this year in summary although there maybe a little bit kind of up and down between volume and price.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And I\u2019ll use my follow-up question with a question to, Joe. Joe, when you think about the patient recruitment timeline in the new contract that you signed. How long will it take before you can come back to kind of like, your clients and back to us, with some proof of concept data points that will show how much time you saved your clients in the enrolment process?","Joe Herring","Yes, well I mean, Ricky keep in mind, we just closed yesterday, and we have to be careful -- have been very careful with things like gun jumping and getting ahead of ourselves. But as you know clinical trials from the time you went until it starts to ramp up to revenue is 6 to 9 to 12 to as much as 18 months. So, we will be talking about this in the future and giving you an idea of how we\u2019re doing. But right now it\u2019s largely manual again. So it will only get too far ahead of ourselves, but ultimately we want to make this industrial strength and bring this as sort of an unparallel offering and a differentiator for our business. So again, we\u2019re one for one right now.","Stephen Anderson","We have about -- we have about six more questions in the queue, and we have about 10 more minutes. So let\u2019s try -- and we\u2019re going to try to manage to finish at about 10:15 please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of AJ. Rice representing UBS. Please proceed.","Albert Rice","Sure. Hello everybody. Maybe I\u2019ll just focus in on this year\u2019s layout of numbers. I know you don\u2019t guide to the quarters. But as we think about the normal seasonal pattern, can you give us anything we should keep in mind as we lay it out, whether its weather in the first quarter or the progression of synergies over the course of the year, anything along those lines?","David P. King","AJ, its Dave. Yes, weather in the first quarter -- obviously the first quarter from the LabCorp diagnostics perspective tends to be a lower quarter, the second and third quarters being stronger. But we don\u2019t guide quarter-by-quarter, and so your best -- your best way you could gain insight into that is to look at prior years and see how the quarters have shaped up.","Albert Rice","Okay. All right. I just was thinking in terms of, I mean because this is a corporate synergy for example, do you think you\u2019ll -- that $35 million lays out pretty evenly across the year, and you got that pretty much upfront or is there any help on the non-traditional seasonal things that you would give us?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yes, this is Glenn, AJ. And I can almost a little bit echo Dave\u2019s comment. If you look at both companies or the combined company we\u2019re today inclusive -- if you'd expect to see a ramp up in the savings over time. So it's not going to be necessarily pro rata, but when you look at the totality of our revenue, when you look at the totality of our earnings, you're going to see the same pattern, if you will, which again is the strength more of a -- more or less in the second and third being stronger than the first and the fourth. But even so, it is again not material, but if you want to model that closely obviously you'd go lighter in the first and the fourth and a little heavier in the second and the third to follow historical patterns partially offset maybe by a ramp up in the cost coming in, but again that\u2019s I\u2019m going to drive the numbers that much from a magnitude standpoint.","Albert Rice","Okay.","David P. King","And clearly the synergies are going to -- the synergies will accelerate as we go through the year. We are not going to have a ton on day one, but they will accelerate as we get into the later quarters.","Paul Surdez","All right. This is Paul. Just real quick on the Covance side, the first quarter does have some seasonality in our early development business, so just make a note of that.","Albert Rice","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Clair representing Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","David Clair","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for letting me in the queue here. Just curious Dave, you mentioned that core testing actually grew faster than esoteric. Just kind of curious what the -- why that happened in the quarter?","David P. King","Well, it's a little bit of tough question why it happened, but \u2026","David Clair","Well, yes, but what slowdown in esoteric I guess?","David P. King","Well, nothing has slowdown in esoteric. Core testing outpaced esoteric is what we\u2019ve said. So esoteric grew consistent with the overall growth of the business, core testing grew faster than the growth of the business and there are probably many thesis about why that happened, but we have people coming in through the exchanges, we have people coming in through Medicaid, we have patients who are previously been uninsured having coverage. The likelihood is that there are initial encounters with physicians and with being covered lives that they're going to run a hepatic panel or lipid profile, and things that we characterize as being in the core as opposed to being in esoteric. So that would be my best assessment of why the core grew faster, but again I don't want to leave the implication that the esoteric didn\u2019t grow. The esoteric grew nicely, the core just outgrew it.","David Clair","Okay, thanks. And just a real quick follow-up in terms of Covance. It sounds like the feedback from the existing customers is pretty solid there, but is there anything baked in the guidance in terms of customer attrition?","David P. King","The guidance incorporates a wide range of outcomes, and so you can assume that we have thought about that and incorporated into our thinking.","David Clair","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro","Good morning guys. Thanks. On the guidance for Covance, I think you called for 46% growth this year and if I wind back the clock to when the deal was announced we talked about I think longer-term growth in that 7% to 8% range. I just want to kind of get a sense of what you guys think it will take for that sort of acceleration to happen? Is there a sort of a timeframe here that you think over several years or could it be something that sort of hockey sticks into the year two, year three post the deal? Trying to get a sense of how you look at accelerating growth? Thank you.","David P. King","Isaac, its Dave. 46% burdened by 330 basis points of negative currency, which if I add 3.3 to 4, I get 7.3 to 9.3. So it's exactly what we said at the time that we did the deal in terms of the growth perspective and we think that opportunity is there for the long-term.","Isaac Ro","Okay. And then, in terms of pricing for this year across the Company, could you maybe give us a sense given your context on the core business for lab, the total?","David P. King","No, as we said before, we guide to revenue, we don't guide to volume or price.","Isaac Ro","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Darren Lehrich","Thanks. Good morning, everybody and congrats to Steve. I may actually go back to eating chicken now. My question is for Dave, and it just relates to ACA and I just wanted to get a quick thought from you Dave, about how you think reform impacted 2014 and then as you think about the 2015 outlook is reform a tailwind, is it neutral? Can you just give us an updated thought or two there?","David P. King","I think the impact Darren, from -- for \u201914 was it helped volume and if I think back to what we said when we initially gave guidance, it helped volume by more than we thought it was going to. It was a drag on price, both because of the things that we mentioned, the core testing growing faster than the esoteric, the patients moving from uninsured into covered categories and [technical difficulty] exchanges and the growth which you saw in the first half of managed Medicaid. So net-net positive for volume, slightly negative for price. 2015 I saw the statistics that there has been some growth in enrollment and re-enrollment for health plans. I don't think there is anything that is going to be material in there. There are some states s that are talking about Medicaid expansion that hadn\u2019t expanded Medicaid previously, that would likely be net positive to volume and negative to price for the reasons that we\u2019ve spoken about. There is obviously some overhang with the Supreme Court taking up the King versus Burwell case that if that were decided adversely to the government position, there would be significant impact on patients receiving subsidies and we would hope that there would be a constructive political response to that as opposed to sort of chaos for people who had insurance one day and don't have at the next. But that at a high level it's probably how we think about the ACA for \u201914 and \u201915.","Darren Lehrich","Okay. But just to be clear, I can hear what you are saying volume and price, was it more or less a push on EBIT? Is that what you're trying to say?","David P. King","No, I think it was probably slightly positive.","Darren Lehrich","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier representing Maxim Group. Please proceed.","Bryan Brokmeier","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. To follow-up on Gary's question from quite a while ago on the core business, you generally drive efficiency improvements and take costs out of the LabCorp business and that\u2019s you\u2019ve normally included in your guidance. Are there other margin expansion opportunities included with -- in the guidance or should we think of those as being lumped in with the LaunchPad, though a much smaller piece in that $0.30?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yes, this is -- Bryan, Glenn. To make sure I understand your question, first of all, we will agree that the normal course of operations as we have continuous improvement, so we are always looking at leveraging and managing our cost structure. When we talk about LaunchPad, you have to think about it a little bit more than that. It's just not kind of the annual improvement to drive cost out and the leverage, but how can we reengineer processes and deploy systems to enable that to happen where you can't do that on the margin. So as we think about taking out around a $150 million plus of cost over the next three years, we have the impact of $50 million arguably would be greater than what would have been the normal reductions in our cost focus in a particular one-year period, so we\u2019re getting the additional benefit of it. But part of what we\u2019re doing is would be also considered the normal course than more structural changes in what we do obviously will accrue as we go to the out years. But we are looking at taking costs out, we are looking at improving our bad debt experience, collections getting paid for tests that we are performing, that we might not have been in the past, and then the more traditional thing such as outsourcing, labor efficiency, so it's all packed in there, but that\u2019s why you see probably a greater impact in \u201915 than in the normal ordinary course of just our continuous improvement.","David P. King","And Bryan, it\u2019s Dave. I think if I understood the question, it is -- it was are there other margin opportunities that are outside -- margin improvement opportunities that are outside the guidance mean the guidance contemplates the operation of the business similar to the way the business operated last year. We had significant growth in esoteric over and above the growth in core, obviously that\u2019s a margin improvement opportunity. So that's why we give a range of guidance is that there are many things embedded in it that can move one way or another.","Bryan Brokmeier","Right. My question was just on the -- when the question was about the core business being flat, I was looking at as if more, it's not flat though margin expansion opportunities that normally we see every year are what included in that $0.30?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yes, that actually -- again, as we think through the $50 million of savings in the first year, that\u2019s correct. We are looking at the total program, some initiatives would have been done without calling it LaunchPad, but that is part of our what we are calling a LaunchPad is our -- call it improvement initiative. But the bigger part of it is that as you think through the three-year total, you start to see more of a structural changes, but it's all-inclusive.","David P. King","And we don't agree that the core business is flat. I don't think that's an accurate characterization.","Bryan Brokmeier","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut representing Jefferies. Please proceed.","Brian Tanquilut","Hey, good morning guys. I promise I will just do one question. So Dave, did volume performance 5% organic, so if you don\u2019t mind just giving us your views right on the market share dynamics and how the hospital market share shift is playing out and what your strategy is and what you guys are doing for that, as you look at to the next three to five years?","David P. King","I don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about market share. I think it's a hard thing to characterize. Our operational team has performed exceptionally well in terms of generating organic volume growth whether that's through contract wins, whether that's through sales, whether that's through service improvements, every day I get e-mails from customers, letters from customers about how LabCorp people go above and beyond to do the things that need to be done to serve the customers and for patient care. That\u2019s we\u2019re going to continue to focus on as part of what LaunchPad is about is, we do a great job today, but there are things that we can do better for the patients, for the physicians, for the payer, so look I think we\u2019re doing a great job operationally. I'm very proud of what we've done operationally and we are going to continue to execute on the operational opportunities that are ahead of us.","Brian Tanquilut","All right. Thanks.","David P. King","Thank you.","Operator","With no further questions at this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the call back to Dave King for any closing remarks.","End of Q&A","David P. King","Thank you. In closing, I'd like to say, we appreciate your time and your questions this morning and your interest. And just would sum up by saying, as we\u2019ve said many times, the healthcare system is demanding better outcomes at lower costs and we\u2019re now the world\u2019s leading healthcare diagnostics company and we have unmatched capabilities to serve every stakeholder in the healthcare system. We have a unique and complete set of tool to deliver what the system needs. It\u2019s an exciting time for LabCorp and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we carryout our key 2015 priorities. Thank you and good day.","Operator","Thank you.

LLC","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to LabCorp's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call maybe recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Frommer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Scott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's second quarter 2018 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Gary Huff, CEO of LabCorp Diagnostics; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","In addition to our press release, we also furnished Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to 2018 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on operating and financial results, and the opportunities for future growth.","These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Scott and good morning. LabCorp delivered another outstanding quarter across our integrated enterprise. The combination of strong organic revenue growth, acquisition contributions, our LaunchPad initiative and the benefits from tax reform powered top line growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 23%. We created value as well through disciplined deployment of our robust free cash flow.","In the quarter, we enhanced Covance's offerings through the Sciformix acquisition, returned capital to shareholders through share repurchase, and reduced our leverage to its lowest level since 2015 through debt paydown.","In addition, we continue to enhance the focus of our portfolio by agreeing to divest our Food Solutions business at a very attractive valuation. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter providing additional proceeds to support value creation. Our strong financial performance results from execution on our key strategic initiatives, which in turn leads to profitable growth and stable enterprise margins.","I will now update you on our progress on each. Our first strategic objective is to support our customer's transition to value based care. In the quarter, we announced significant multiyear agreements with UnitedHealthcare and Aetna. In both instances, our proven track record of delivering convenient, high quality and cost effective services translated into expanded opportunities and fair reimbursement rates.","Furthermore, these partnerships incorporated a broad range of innovative and value based arrangements. We have multiple initiatives underway with our customers to retain United business and capitalize on our growth opportunity with Aetna. As we have said, given the relative size of each company's insured population, we expect the net result to negatively impact revenue and profit next year. Nonetheless, these partnerships reinforce our strong competitive position in the fragmented clinical laboratory market. They also highlight LabCorp's increasingly important role in delivering targeted care to patients through our leadership in population health tools and personalized medicine capabilities.","In the quarter, we continued to expand those tools and capabilities through, among other activities, our digital pathology partnership with Philips and the commercial launch of OmniSeq Advance, a precision medicine tool that includes key immunotherapy biomarkers.","Our second strategic objective is to enhance the drug development process. We continue to deliver high quality performance on one of the largest backlogs in the industry, demonstrate the value of our differentiated beyond lab, beyond CRO offering to sponsors and invest in expanded solutions to increase trial efficiency and improve the patient experience.","During the quarter, we were selected by a top 40 biopharma sponsor with whom we have not collaborated in the past for a dual source strategic partnership. One of the primary reasons the sponsor selected Covance was our strong data and study feasibility solutions. We will provide clinical development and central laboratory services across all therapeutic areas for this customer.","Our early development business won a competitive process to become a primary provider strategic partner with a top 10 pharma sponsor. We expect toxicology awards from this sponsor to eventually double from current levels with new awards beginning at the end of this year. These partnerships will ramp over time; neither benefited net orders or book-to-bill in the quarter.","In companion diagnostics, we delivered record quarterly revenue and signed a new commercial partnership with Unilabs that will facilitate greater availability of companion diagnostics throughout Europe. Companion diagnostics is a global opportunity and the partnership with Unilabs is the first step in extending our unique companion Dx offering worldwide.","We also did continue to invest in the CRO of the future. These investments begin with LaunchPad, which is progressing at a rapid pace and contributed to Covance's 80 basis point margin improvement in the quarter. The global service delivery model we discussed last quarter is up and running, improving quality and optimizing our utilization of resources and infrastructure.","At the same time, we added a global preferred site partnerships, incorporated mobile health technologies into traditional studies and enhanced our virtual clinical trial capabilities, highlighted by another key customer adoption of the accelerated suite of technology tools. Each of these opportunities, along with our patient and investigator performance data, represents progress toward better trial design, site selection, patient recruitment and patient experience.","Our third strategic objective is to create a leading consumer engagement platform. We continue to enhance patient convenience and engagement, broaden our channel to market and build brand loyalty. We also continue to improve the consumer-friendly tools in our patient service centers and on mobile apps.","Our strategic collaboration with Walgreens has expanded to 16 stores with the addition of sites in Florida. We plan to expand this partnership into additional markets this year and are actively discussing ways that we can expand and integrate our combined services.","Our consumer platform focuses on meeting consumers where they want to be met and our next innovation will let us reach them at home. We have made significant progress on the validation of our innovative self-collection device, showing strong concordance between test results collected with our device and traditional venous blood draws. The device is currently in beta testing and we remain on track to make it available commercially later this year.","Before I turn the call over to Glenn I want to address the recent ransomware event at LabCorp. When our IT team detected suspicious activity on our network, we promptly took certain systems offline. That action was designed first and foremost to protect the private information of the patients we serve. This decision was the right one, although it led to a disruption in service which required approximately one week for recovery. Operations have now returned to normal.","Our investigation, which has included highly respected independent forensic IT experts, has found no evidence of theft or misuse of data. We are still assessing the full financial impact of this event. We have incurred costs related to remediation efforts. It is too early to determine the volume impact at this time. We believe the financial impact will not be significant and the company has cyber insurance coverage. As a result, this event does not cause a change in our full year guidance range.","Although we have a host of tools to guard against and mitigate this sort of attack the critical components of recovery was our people. They worked long hours with little rest. They demonstrated amazing teamwork to get problems solved. They stayed calm in the face of great adversity. They went the extra mile to help patients and clients in need and they were attentive and responsive to doctors, consumers and partners who needed more information. They did these things because we are here to serve the patients who need us as we have been and always will be.","When people ask what makes me proud of LabCorp, I always say it is the passion of my colleagues for what we do. In our nearly 50 years of existence, that passion has never been more sharply in focus than during this incident. Every one of my colleagues stood tall in a time of great challenge and I thank each of them from the bottom of my heart. Because of their commitment to and passion for our mission to improve health and improve lives, LabCorp continues to prosper and to deliver value to everyone who depends on us.","Now, I'll turn the call over to over to Glenn.","Glenn Andrew Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with commentary on our full year outlook. As a reminder, on January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, meaning that we restated our 2017 financial results to better enable the valuation of our 2018 performance and guidance. In the press release, our prepared remarks and the Q&A session to follow, all references to our 2017 results are to the restated numbers unless we specifically note otherwise.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, an increase of 13.4% over last year, as acquisitions added 10.5%, organic revenue increased 2.1%, and we benefited from foreign currency translation of 80 basis points. Operating income for the quarter was $369 million, or 12.9% of revenue, compared to $330 million or 13% last year. During the quarter we had $36 million of restructuring charges and special items primarily related to acquisitions, integration, our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative and the planned divestiture of the Food Solutions business.","Adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization of $59 million, restructuring charges and special items, was $463 million or 16.2% of revenue, compared to $431 million or 17.1% last year. The $32 million increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to acquisitions, organic revenue growth and savings from our LaunchPad initiative, partially offset by lower Medicare pricing as a result of the implementation of PAMA and personnel costs. The 90 basis point decline in operating margins was due to the implementation of PAMA and the mix impact from the acquisition of Chiltern, which was not in the prior year's results.","The tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%, compared to 33.7% last year. The adjusted tax rate, excluding special charges and amortization, was 24.5%, down from 33.6% last year. This lower rate was primarily due to the implementation of tax reform in the U.S. We continue to expect the full-year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%.","Strong operational performance and the benefit of tax reform translated into net earnings for the quarter of $234 million or $2.27 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges and other special items, were $2.98 in the quarter, up 23% over last year.","Operating cash flow was $367 million in the quarter, up from $311 million a year ago. The increase was due to higher cash earnings and favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $87 million or 3% of revenue, compared to $69 million or 2.7% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $280 million in the quarter, up from $241 million last year.","We remained active throughout the quarter in terms of capital allocation. At quarter end, our cash balance was $221 million, down from $362 million at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we invested $79 million in acquisitions and repurchased $75 million of stock.","As of June 30, we had $994 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we also paid down $310 million of the company's variable rate term loan. This brought our total debt to $6.5 billion at quarter end, reducing our leverage to 3.1 times gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA at the top end of our target leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times.","Now, I'll review our segment performance beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by acquisitions, organic volume measured by requisitions, and the benefit from currency translation of approximately 30 basis points. These favorable items were partially offset by the negative impact from PAMA.","Revenue per requisition decreased 0.7% primarily due to the impact of PAMA, partially offset by acquisitions. Total volume increased 5.8%, of which organic volume was 2.8% and acquisition volume was 3%.","Note that our acquisitions of Mount Sinai's outreach business and PAML, excluding certain related joint ventures, annualized in May. LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $376 million or 20.7% of revenue, compared to $376 million or 21.8% last year.","Operating income benefited from organic volume growth and acquisitions, which were essentially offset by the negative impact from PAMA and personnel costs. The decline in operating margin was primarily due to the negative impact from PAMA.","Now, I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately 31% over last year due to acquisitions, organic growth and the benefit from 180 basis points of foreign currency translation.","Adjusted operating income for the segment was $123 million or 11.7% of revenue, compared to $89 million or 11% last year. The $35 million increase in operating income and 80 basis point improvement in margins were primarily due to organic demand, LaunchPad savings and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. We are on track to deliver $150 million of net savings from Covance LaunchPad by the end of 2020 and $30 million of cost synergies from the integration of Chiltern by the end of 2019.","For the trailing 12 months, net orders were $4.9 billion and net book-to-bill was 1.22. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $9 billion, a decrease of approximately $200 million from last quarter, primarily due to foreign currency translation relating to the stronger U.S. dollar. We expect approximately $3.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","Now, I'll discuss our 2018 guidance which assumes foreign exchange rates as of June 30 for the remainder of the year and includes the impact from currently anticipated deployment of free cash flow toward acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment.","In addition, this guidance includes the expected financial impact related to the previously announced divestiture of the Food Solutions business in the third quarter. We expect revenue growth of 10.5% to 11.5% over 2017 revenue of $10.3 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 50 basis points of currency translation. This is a narrowing of the range as compared to our prior guidance of 10% to 12%, as the increased revenue outlook in Covance Drug Development is offset by the planned divestiture of the Food Solutions business.","We expect LabCorp Diagnostics revenue growth of 3% to 4.5% over 2017 revenue of $6.9 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 20 basis points of currency translation. This is a decrease from our prior guidance of 3.5% to 5.5% due to the planned divestiture of the Food Solutions business.","For modeling purposes, the Food Solutions business generated revenue of approximately $150 million in 2017 at margins in line with the Diagnostics segment overall, but at a significantly higher revenue per requisition.","We expect Covance Drug Development revenue growth of 23% to 26% over 2017 revenue of $3.5 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 110 basis points of currency translation. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 21% to 25% due to higher-than-expected investigator fees and other pass-through expenses (sic) [revenues] for which the company will be reimbursed, partially offset by the 120 basis point change in foreign currency translation due to the stronger U.S. dollar. We remain on track to deliver mid to high-single digit organic growth in 2018.","Our adjusted EPS guidance is $11.35 to $11.65, a narrowing of the range as compared to our prior guidance of $11.30 to $11.70. Finally, we expect free cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, unchanged from our prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks and we will now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. Dave, can you help us put some ranges around what you think the net-net impact of the new UnitedHealth and Aetna relationships will be in 2019? And also what are some of the investments you're going to put in place to try and drive share gains with other payers during this period?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Morning, Jack. I'll make a couple comments on this and ask if Gary has anything further. I think it's not appropriate to talk about ranges of outcomes with United and Aetna because we're not guiding toward 2019 now. I will say that as we have said from the beginning, given the number of covered lives in each of those plans, it is highly likely that yeah, we'll lose more in United than we'll pick up in Aetna. That's not anything against United or against Aetna, it's just the reality is there are more covered lives under United and we have a larger percentage then of that market. So that will have a negative impact on revenue and obviously on profit. And as we always do, we'll look at what are the opportunities to tweak the cost structure to accommodate those changes.","In terms of tools for share gain, I think one of the most critical things that we're doing and that we've talked about is all the work we're doing around data and data integration. So the population health tools that we've mentioned, the integration with the Covance data, the data and analytics that we're working on to overlap with Walgreens, for example, with their patient population and the combination of capabilities.","And I think the \u2013 as we talk with large customers, I saw a couple of them last week, they want to know not only how are my patients doing, where are my gaps in care, what are the opportunities that I have to treat better so that I can receive bonus payments and improve Star Ratings. They also want to know in a health system, for example, how is my patient cohort performing against comparable patient cohorts? How are my physicians performing against comparable physicians both internally and externally? So we are really focused on how we use the data tools to enhance our offerings.","In conjunction with that, the whole digital opportunity, so the mobile approximately, the increasing reach to consumers, the self check-in in patient service centers, the realtime email feedback on the patient experience, which allows us to not only do Net Promoter calculations but also to do, literally, contemporaneous improvements of the patient experience, and again, thinking about how we integrate those opportunities and experiences with our partners during the check-in process at Walgreens, for example, or using the Walgreens mobile app and the LabCorp app together.","So these are all things that we're talking about working towards as we think about how can we enhance our opportunities to create brand identification and gain share with the consumer, with the health system, with the physician beyond our traditional sales mechanisms. Gary, anything you would like to add to that?","Gary M. Huff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I would like to say that, first of all, we look at the Aetna and UnitedHealthcare as an opportunity for us and it really comes down to organizational execution of a plan. I would like to say that we have an extensive plan. We are mobilized and we're prepared to execute on that plan.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great. And Dave, a lot of your color, it's a good lead into the next question I had for you and John, which is just can you update us on any progress you'd made rolling out the check-in tool and getting patients to opt-in for Covance? And just related to that, some of the progress you made on the expanded strategic relationships, did they have any impact on the timing of bookings in the quarter?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well I'll start with the check-in tool. So a couple of things on that. One is that the database of patients who have opted in to be contacted continues to grow. I think more important, after consideration and review of how we engage with patients, we have a significant opportunity to engage with patients through the collection of email addresses at self check-in, the billing process, so we have a very, very large base of email addresses.","And we will be using those as well to communicate with patients about their interest in trial opportunities and to solicit their consent for opt-in. So the number of patients who are coming and checking is just a subset of the people that we'll be communicating with about how can they opt into trials.","And we're actually enthused about that opportunity for a lot of reasons, not only because, look, trial criteria tend to be quite narrow and it's not \u2013 even patients who are interested are not always eligible, but when you think about the number of patients who come and see us and whose email addresses we collect and who pay our bills, we have a enormous opportunity to capitalize on what we've talked about as sort of next generation trials, so virtual trials, virtual control alarms, observational studies, our market access business, all simply through the LabCorp data that we have and the ability to communicate with those customers on behalf of Covance. So that's where we are on the opt-in on the database and we continue to see very strong progress there. And I'll turn it over to John in terms of the impact of data on the bookings.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","As the integration into Drug Development has matured, we're looking at that data capability as really an important factor necessary to be successful. We've now exceeded $1 billion in awards where our data capabilities have facilitated the selection of Covance. We expect to exceed the cumulative revenue of $150 million through 2018, higher than our initial estimate tied to the acquisition.","We now have demonstrated, as we did even on the Investor and Analyst Day, case studies that showcase the realtime demonstrations of the really actionable nature of these unique assets. I'm sure we'll get into the bookings of the quarter, but clearly, the strategic partnerships and, as Dave even noted, the clinical partnership was enabled through our data capabilities in the clinical space to a top 40 sponsor.","And then finally in terms of data, we've been able to demonstrate through our central lab data on how we have compared to the industry on the timing of oncology studies as an example, where we finished our oncology studies anywhere from three to five months earlier than our competition. So clearly, data and our capability there is facilitating a winning environment for Covance.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you both.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks very much. Good morning, Dave. I just wanted to follow up with some of your comments around what's happening in the managed care market today. As we think about this, I understand that, clearly, United is bigger than Aetna, but how do we think about the shift to the large national players like yourselves and Quest? One, how do you think you're differentiated from Quest? And two, within the new contracts, is there any even bigger opportunity to continue to move market share away from the regional labs?","And as we think about that, you talked a lot about data and analytics, population health tools, how do we think about value based care, and how you potentially can be paid around value based offerings and enhancements to the current contract around any kind of value based initiative?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Lisa. So both the United contract and the Aetna contract contained value based care initiatives and some value based care commitments. And without going into an enormous amount of detail, suffice it to say there is opportunity for us in revenue if we can redirect work away from higher cost providers. I will say the reality is we cannot do that ourselves. There are many reasons why lab work goes to higher cost providers. Many health systems are very insistent the doctors send their work to their own captive laboratories. They do things like telling us that we can't have an interface to return results electronically, so everything has to go back on fax, which is inconvenient for the doctor in terms of putting that information into the medical record.","So there are structural obstacles, but there are things that we and our managed care partners are working on, including things like benefit design to redirect work from out of network to in network laboratories and other initiatives that will help support our benefiting from value based care initiatives.","In terms of the overall market and market opportunity for large nationals versus regionals and health systems, it's still a highly fragmented market. We have a strong competitive position, which is founded on convenience, quality, service and cost effectiveness. And we continue to build out that infrastructure with initiatives like the LabCorp-Walgreens, the home testing and other ways in which we engage with and reach the consumer where the consumer wants to be met.","So we feel that we're extremely well positioned in the market competitively and we're going to continue to work on ways that we can not only provide value to the health system and provide value to the physician, but gain the identification with the consumer as a trusted provider of more than numbers on a piece of paper but a trusted provider of knowledge about my health condition and how I can manage it better.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And how do we think about your competitive position against the other national provider? Is there something that you feel that you have differentiated in the marketplace, or is this just more of we believe there's two big national providers who are fairly comparable and the real opportunity is to move it away from the regional players that you just talked about?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think if you look at performance, the market clearly sees differentiation. That's why we are gaining organic volume. That's why we're moving forward with key initiatives. That's why we're leading in innovation. I think if you compare the tools that are being offered to the patient, our tools are measurably better. They're measurably more convenient. And if you look at the population health tools that we're offering to health systems and physicians and the kinds of collaboration that we're doing, we see ourselves as differentiated. And my view is the market is telling us the same thing.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I don't want to beat this to death, but if we look at their organic growth in this quarter versus yours, are you saying that you believe that the market's saying \u2013 with the organic growth nearly 2 times what theirs were in the quarter, that's the market showing the difference between LabCorp and Quest, or is it your customer mix? I just want to understand as we think about going into 2019 and some of the shifts in the contracting.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, look, I never say that we're gaining share because it's so difficult to determine and I just don't think there's a reliable measure for it. Our organic volume speaks for itself. It was very strong in the quarter again. It was strong across all lines of testing and all areas of testing and so the market is telling us what the market is telling us and I leave it to others to interpret what that means.","Again, Lisa, I appreciate the detail or the persistence on the topic but one of the important things to remember as you think about 2019 is we are the network that is opening to our competitor, which is United, has more covered lives than the network that's opening to us which is Aetna. So the impact, invariably, is we will lose more with United than we will gain with Aetna, and that will have an impact on revenue and profitability for us.","So all of the positives are there and the market is telling us that positives are working. But when you think about 2019, you have to realize that the numbers say what they say, which is we'll bear a greater burden in terms of share loss than our competitor will just because of covered lives in the contracts.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell of Baird. Your line is now open.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks very much. First one is, I was just hoping I could get the CROs true growth, the organic constant currency growth? Or maybe stated differently, if you can give us the M&A contribution, because I think we already have FX.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. We have this high-single digit growth on the organic side, Eric, in terms of the CRO, and are on track to have that on the full year with respect to the legacy \"Covance.\"","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. And can I get the M&A dollars, please?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We're not delineating that out in terms of the segments, Eric.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then on the book-to-bill, realize there is a big FX adjustment in here. Can you talk about what the book-to-bill would have been on a constant currency basis? And also I know in your 8-K you talk about the ASC 605 book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis. I don't think we have all of the pieces to pull together what the \u2013 or not book-to-bill, but what the trailing 12-month is. I don't think we can do the quarter because we don't have ASC 605 basis revenue, but I was hoping you could give that to us as well.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We delineated out in the 8-K the ASC 605 versus ASC 606. Why don't I just take the opportunity, Eric, to address the booking pipeline at the same time and then hopefully that gives you at least some granularity being a little proactive and talk about even some of the segments. Fair enough?","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, yeah.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We had, with respect to the pipeline, very strong pipeline of opportunities. We still see that. It's actually the highest level that I've seen since my time at Covance in the central labs in early development; and even the clinical side is up versus last quarter.","As Dave talked about, the competition, strategic partnerships, the dual source award with top 40 biopharma sponsor was really in part due to our data capabilities on the clinical side, selecting in the early development. He also chatted a little bit about the primary provider that we were selected as with current top 10 pharma where we should double the awards over time.","And then, finally, we then had and agreed to extension of the sole source central lab award with the top 10 pharma sponsors. That actually took an award that we had from three years with an optional two, to five years with an optional two. Seven-year sole source deals are a beautiful thing. It's probably (39:15) anyone, but we're seeing no bookings from those partnerships now ramp over the next year, plus some bookings did shift from Q2 to Q3. That's not uncommon. That's why we focus on really the trailing 12-month period.","And speaking from about 15 years of experience in this piece of the business, 1.24 times on a ASC 605 basis or 1.22 times on a ASC 606 basis trailing 12 months, especially when you have an early development business, is a strong result. So in terms of the clarity on the book-to-bills and hopefully between what I stated as well as what's in the 8-K that you can get to the math on what you're trying to get to.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, it truly sounds encouraging. I mean, you guys sound upbeat in your prepared remarks as well as here and you've given us a lot of good anecdotes about future awards, but just when you go from a 1.34 to 1.24 times...","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, I'm positive. I like my business. I like my industry. The industry in general based on the FDA approvals, based on the biotech funding, based on our now with Chiltern acquisition, participating in that segment, all those are positives in my evaluation. And I know that there is some debate on internal versus external. I've seen that over a decade here in terms of the ins and outs, but bottom line is we're seeing penetration to the CRO business increasing. And there is plenty of surveys out there to demonstrate that.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, I really appreciate all the comments. I guess my point is, what I'm trying to get to is, the quarter itself was a weak quarter for bookings it looks like. Some of that was currency adjustment, which we appreciate. We factored that in. But when your trailing 12-month book-to-bill goes from a 1.34 to a 1.24 times, that's a 0.4 times impact from the quarter alone compared to the trailing 12-month average the prior quarter. So I just want to know what was weak this quarter. I can fully appreciate the comments on what's going to drive the future.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","From the standpoint of the performance, it was pretty consistent across businesses. Early development had level of strength. And then on the clinical and central lab side, we saw clearly some level of shifting from a Q2 to a Q3. Not uncommon, but did happen within those segments.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much. I appreciate the comments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. I maybe just want to follow-up on that quickly with just a qualifier. So normally when you sort of go through the process of re-signing a larger strategic relationship, et cetera, is it possible you see some delay relative to that? Or possibly in a given Q, awards may not come around a certain strategic, whereas they may be lumpy in a later part of the year which is I think what you're kind of suggesting around 3Q. I just want to sort of understand that because it seems like if there was a key partner you renewed with, that would sort of be a relevant explanation.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It is. But at the same time, we're on a contract basis. So when we get these big strategic partnerships, we're not taking those into bookings until the program underneath that partnership actually gets transacted in a contract. So you'll see that through time. You'll see that in terms of moving to startup and then into full recruitment.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And it's Dave. Just to add a little color to that. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, two major things we talked about are significant accomplishments, but the awards won't start to ramp until next year. So you will see those in future awards. You're not seeing them now.","The other thing is, to Eric's point, when you think about a trailing 12, obviously, it's not just the current quarter that has the impact. If a strong earlier quarter falls off and you have a less strong current quarter, you're going to see a kind of a double whammy in terms of a trailing 12. So I think it's important to recognize that it's not all a one quarter impact when you're looking at the trailing 12-month number.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful Dave. And maybe just quickly on the lab business, you've had a boost from consumer genomics for a while. There was an interesting announcement this morning with GSK and 23andMe. It seems to be sort of expanding the profile. I guess what are your sort of thoughts on where that business is going and kind of your play there. It seems like it's been a nice additive to your growth overall in the lab.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Absolutely. We have a terrific collaboration with 23andMe. We think of them as important strategic collaborators. We spend a lot of time with them talking about, just as we do with our other partners, about other things that we can do together. And they continue to be a nice component of our organic growth, but also a thought partner for what we do with data how we better engage consumers how we build that brand association.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Excellent. Thanks Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks. I'm curious kind of how you view your sort of position now in Covance in some of the faster growing areas of the CRO market, whether it be or FSP or real-world evidence, now how are you positioned with Chiltern as well as I think you did a recent bolt-on acquisition in the late stage post approval area. I guess should these bolt-on deals continuing in the CRO space? And I noticed you did expedite that Chiltern synergy capture. I guess could you elaborate on that impetus for that? Thanks.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. We feel good with our positions with respect to the FSP, the real-world evidence, the biotech late stage areas. The Chiltern acquisition, we did move up. We are in the very, very final stages of that integration. Organization's done, leaderships picked, best of the best, that all has actually happened. We have now intertwined the organization with respect to processes, et cetera.","The only thing truly, the long poles in the tent, if you want to call it that, or system integrations that actually are flowing through now, July\/August. So we see that as materially complete. That has added real strength in terms of the FSP areas. We had significant monitoring skill on the legacy Covance clinical. And now with the biometrics skill of the Chiltern organization, that now allows us to go to the enterprise and bid on the enterprise and in fact involve in terms of with those opportunities now through the second half.","Clearly, on the biotech stage that has enhanced our capabilities. Ever since I've been here, Covance has ticked up from the high-teens in terms of the 16% to kind of 18% levels to now 30% of our revenue is from the biotech area. So real strength there that came from the Chiltern acquisition.","Obviously, on the data side, we talked a bit about that earlier, building out that post-marketing real-world evidence areas. We believe in our data solution and that strengthened our later stage capabilities, so a little bit about our position.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up, how is Walgreens progressing? And would you say it's progressing according to plan? And when do you think we'll get meaningful contributions from that effort? And then taking that a step further, how could you potentially leverage the Walgreens relationship across Covance as well with potentially a greater focus on virtual trials? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, I think \u2013 it's Dave. And obviously, we continue to expand the footprint. We will be opening more stores and entering new locations throughout this year. We see the Walgreens partnership as a valuable new channel for reaching consumers. And we have collected quite a bit of data showing that not only are these \u2013 are many of these patients new to LabCorp, but there are also patients who don't typically shop at Walgreens.","We also have data showing that many of the patients are filling a prescription at the same time they're getting their lab work done. So the theses on which we went into this which is we want to be in retail, we want to create engagement with the consumer and we want to be in a health care environment are all valid.","In terms of integration of capabilities with Covance, I think, I mentioned that earlier in the comments with response to Jack's question. But the creation of large databases of patients, knowing their disease condition and what drugs they're taking is very valuable in terms of virtual trials. It also can be valuable in terms of virtual controls arms for trials where patients are following one course of treatment as opposed to being in the trial course of treatment.","There's a substantial amount of opportunity to benefit both the enterprise and the individual businesses from Walgreens. And we have continuing and in-depth and extensive conversations with them about what our key priorities are and how we can accelerate.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Maybe just one on the lab side, looking at the revenue per requisition trends, obviously, the first decline there in a while. Certainly understand PAMA as a headwind, but can you just talk through the dynamics there and then also your confidence level and drivers for improvement moving forward?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, it's Dave. So I think you broke up a little bit but I think your question was revenue per requisition. And so let me start by saying that the PAMA impact on revenue per acquisition more than accounted for the total decline. Okay, so if we take PAMA out, revenue per acquisition would have been up. The other factors that have an impact on revenue per requisition are acquisitions, obviously; test mix, and inside the test mix, as we have said a number of times, 23andMe is a highly valuable strategic collaboration for us. It is at a lower price point than our average price point and therefore it mixes us down even though it contributes to volume.","So I will say also that pricing on the managed care front from our perspective is stable. We're not seeing pricing headwinds for managed care. And obviously, the pricing impact of United and Aetna, which we've talked about previously, wouldn't take effect until the first of next year so that would not have any impact on price.","So to recap, and then I'll ask Glenn if any further comments, but to recap, if you back PAMA out of the equation, price would have been up.","Glenn Andrew Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think you've covered it, Dave.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe just one on capital allocation. The M&A consolidation story on the lab industry side may have been a bit slower to develop than anticipated. So can you just talk through the pipeline there, any acceleration in conversations with hospitals as PAMA squeezes margins a bit more as the year progresses?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. So the M&A pipeline is robust and healthy and there are a number of interesting opportunities. Obviously, we evaluate every opportunity based on our key metrics which are accretion, recovering our cost of capital within three years, return on invested capital, strategic fit, so all of the factors that we have enumerated before.","In terms of hospitals and health systems, we take the view that we are interested in broad strategic partnerships with key anchor systems, so Providence St. Joseph, Novant, Mount Sinai PAML. These are deals that take time to materialize but they're more than just we take over a lab and manage the laboratory. There are deals that include data, they include pathology, they include reference testing, they include a whole range of services. And we have a significant number of health system opportunities on the table in front of us but again, it's difficult to predict what the timing is.","I will say I think there \u2013 earlier in the year, as we commented on the first quarter call, there was some \u2013 yeah, everybody was trying to getting used to the impact of PAMA and what was it going to mean. And I think we're seeing that people are seeing the consequences and they are thinking about what their strategic options might be with their lab assets.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Your line is now open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I joined a little bit late, so I apologize if you did go through this, but Quest yesterday specifically called out pressure in hep C, vitamin D and drug monitoring. Dave, I guess based on your commentary earlier, it sounded like you said your organic growth was strong across all categories. So, one, I just wanted to sort of call out and see if you saw any of these pressures within those categories. And then they specifically cited policy changes and higher denials that sounded sort of more macro than company-specific. Again, are you just sort of not seeing it or can you give us any color within those categories? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thanks, Ralph. So even though we're getting close to the top of the hour, I do want to spend a couple of minutes on this because I think it's created some uncertainty across the industry, which I don't think is merited. So, first of all, I think it's important that we distinguish between volume and revenue. So policy changes and denials do not affect volume, they affect revenue.","Now I could say with respect to all three of those test categories: hepatitis C, vitamin D and medical drug monitoring, that our volume for each of those three categories of tests was up in the quarter, and medical drug monitoring was up substantially in the quarter. So that's volume.","Now, revenue, we are seeing, as we have seen for years, more and more limited coverage policies, restrictive payment policies, preauthorization policies implemented by payers in an effort to control their lab spend. We don't agree with those policies. Many of those policies, particularly in medical drug monitoring, are aimed at curbing fraud and abuse but they are using blunt instruments that affect compliant players like us and Quest just as much as they affect the non-compliant players. So we are seeing more denials and those denials affect revenue and so they slow revenue growth. And obviously, they also have an impact on write-offs and bad debt.","But we did not see volume declines in any of those areas, and in fact, we saw volume increases in all three. I will say specifically with a comment on hepatitis C genotyping, yes, we did see a decline in hepatitis C genotyping, but hepatitis C genotyping is a very small fraction of our total hepatitis C portfolio and is not something that would have a significant impact on our volume overall. And to recapitulate, total hepatitis C volume was up in the quarter in any event. So I hope that helps in terms of verification, Ralph, with how we saw those tests performing.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes that's helpful. And then just one more quick one, with the Walgreen relationship, it sounds like you've been pretty happy with the relationship to this point. Is there sort of a gating factor of a much broader and kind of wider expansion?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","The only gating factor is store selection and build-out, and we are far down the road in the process of talking about a significant expansion of the partnership.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Deutsche. Your line is now open.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Another product-specific question on the lab side. Can you update us on the trends in your NIPT business, the sizing of that and how you're thinking about the potential for expansion of average-risk coverage? Thank you.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, I'll start and then Gary's probably closer to it. NIPT is growing nicely. The Sequenom acquisition was terrific complement to our NIPT portfolio, and we continue to see strong volume growth there as well as across women's health.","In terms of average-risk, I think there was some optimism that the physician groups will come out with a stronger statement in favor of average-risk screening, which I think did not happen in their last meeting. But I think the support of the physician groups for non-invasive prenatal testing of average-risk patients is growing. And, over time, we expect to see better payer coverage of that test or that utilization of the test. Gary, anything further to add there?","Gary M. Huff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I'd just say one thing in regards to the NIPT testing, we are seeing good growth there and it is a great complement to our industry-leading women's health portfolio. So as we continue to leverage and drive our women's health growth, it's a key component. And we see the reimbursement landscape becoming more promising.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky, please check your mute button. Again, Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Let's just go to the next question, please.","Operator","All right. Our next question is Kevin Ellich of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Hey, Dave. Just two quick questions. A lot's been talked about. Organic growth is pretty strong; did you guys quantify how much contribution came from 23andMe?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Kevin, good morning. We did not quantify how much came from 23andMe. I would say, obviously, it's a strong contributor. Quarter-over-quarter, it was less of a contributor to organic growth than the prior quarter. So, sequentially, it was less meaningful to the organic growth than 1Q.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Understood. Thank you. And then, Glenn, capital expenditures, we saw a little increase. Free cash flow guidance was maintained. Just wondering how we should think about CapEx going forward. Are there any big things we should be looking for?","Glenn Andrew Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Kevin, we're pretty much tracking where we thought. When we gave our original guidance, we talked about around a 3.5% of revenue spend this year which would be higher than the past years if we see good opportunities to invest for the growth of the business. But we're tracking pretty much on that which is why we're maintaining our guidance range.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. So one question kind of maybe at a high level. Curious if you're kind of a few years into the Covance acquisition now, are you seeing any pull-through from the early development business at Covance to the late stage business? And kind of what are your thoughts around the synergy of owning both of those businesses?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","This is John. In terms of we are seeing pull-through. We are seeing pull-through in terms of from the tox business, the BioA business into our clin pharm [clinical pharmacology] Phase I areas. That's what we're actually tracking. We have seen that increase. Well, we are and have put in place a organization to actually move that from the early development stage into the Phase I clin pharm areas and then move that then up into the II, III, IV.","Obviously, in terms of there is some falloff in terms of \u2013 this is clinical research, products do get rejected in that early development stage. But we have a group now of scientists that actually do a level of due diligence in terms of the early development on how that should then be pushed into either our BioA CMC areas or clin pharm areas, and we are seeing upticks in terms of those businesses. It is a clear differentiator. We are the only CRO that actually does all three.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Two quick ones for me. Dave, just speaking to the structural obstacles to move more lab business in network, can you talk a little bit about how long you see before that happens? And presumably this is some sort of step function over several years. And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. One of the structural obstacles is plans that have an out-of-network benefit. So if I'm an employer and I have a plan that pays 50% of billed charges or 70% of usual and customary for out-of-network and you have non-compliant behavior by out-of-network labs where they're willing to write off patient responsibility, they can do pretty well at 50% of billed charges and writing off the balance. And until we have changes in benefit design, there is really nothing that we or Quest or anybody else can do to bring that work into the network.","So this is not something that's going to happen overnight, Bill. It's a great question and it's going to require a sustained effort on the part of the managed care industry, employers and healthcare providers to encourage compliant behavior and to encourage benefit design and structural setups that reward patients for bringing their work into the network.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, got it. And then just a quick clarification, appreciate the rev rec was up excluding PAMA, can you separate specifically what PAMA was in terms of the negative effect on rev rec? Thanks.","Glenn Andrew Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, Bill. This is Glenn. What we've said is that the impact from PAMA for the full year would be around $70 million, and that would be pretty pro rata over the period of time. So I think you can get to that. Whereas Dave said, you get to roughly around, call it, 100 basis points. So of the 70 basis point decline, the negative impact from PAMA really accounted for more than the decline year-over-year.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murray (sic) [Murphy] of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Max Smock - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Max on for Amanda. Thank you for taking my question. Just a few quick ones for me.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, no, no, no, no, two. Two is what you get. Two quick ones. We're 10 past the hour.","Max Smock - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got you. Yeah, I was \u2013 just limit it to two. Just a quick one on 23andMe. I was wondering if you were seeing any slowdown in terms of volume now that you've moved past the holiday season into the back half of the year?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think that's a question better directed to 23andMe than it is us, it's not our position to kind of comment on their volume trends.","Max Smock - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Appreciate that color. And then moving to Covance and a little bit about your updated guidance, I was wondering \u2013 we talked a little bit about the shift towards the late stage, I was wondering how much of that increase in guidance was just kind of pull-through of the existing backlog as maybe opposed to an increase in sales?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It's truly, Max, it would be in the clinical late stage, but it was more so because of an uptick in the pass-through investigator fees, a little bit offset by currency, but it would be in that clinical stage, but it was much more so in that pass-through, investigator fees.","Max Smock - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, can you hear me now?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Sorry for that before. So Dave, I wanted to go back to a comment that you made when you talked about revenue per requisition. And specifically you said that the pricing impact from United and Aetna will not take effect until next year. So on the impact from United and Aetna, we get a lot of questions from investors on how should we think about the pricing component of these relationships. So when you talk about 2019 and about the financial impact, can you just clarify whether this is merely a reflection of your expectations for volumes, or is price a factor as well?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So as we said at the time of the renewal, we were very pleased with the pricing of both. And as we also said, we had discussed during the negotiations that if the United contract opened up that we would expect a price increase, and we said we were very pleased with the outcome of the discussion. So I'll leave you to draw the inference. I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that.","With respect to how we see the impact next year, the impact will be lost volume and that will be the revenue and the profitability impact. We're not factoring price as a contributor to how we balance out the United loss versus the Aetna gain.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up there, in terms of the volume, can you maybe give us \u2013 I know that you say that it's too early to talk about the volume cadence in 2009. But maybe you can give us some perspective to go back to 2007, how long did it take you to pick up share back then? And what might be different or not this time around that is just going to help us with that framework?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think you and I maybe were the only ones around in 2007, Ricky, so we have the only memories. So first of all let me just say 2007, different situation because we were both in network with United prior to the change in January of 2007. So in 4Q of 2006, LabCorp was a network. Quest was a network, but United has made the announcement in October that the contract would be switching over. We saw a very significant movement of volume in the fourth quarter of 2006 leading into the first quarter of 2007. So the impact was pretty substantial in 4Q 2006, pretty substantial in 1Q 2007 and then it tapered off.","This time our competitor is not in the network in 4Q of 2018. So consequently, we don't expect volume to shift in 4Q of 2018, because if it does shift, what will happen is, first of all, United will see an increase because of the out-of-network rates. Second of all, patients will see an increase in patient responsibility, so that would put the patient in the middle and that's obviously not, I think, anybody's goal here.","So we don't expect significant movement in the fourth quarter of 2018, which means that what's going to move will probably largely move in the first quarter of 2019 and then somewhat in the second quarter, but we certainly expect the bulk of the impact to be in the first half of 2019.","Ricky R.

Welcome to your Q1 2017 LabCorp Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session and our instructions will follow at that time.","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Scott Frommer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.","Scott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's first quarter 2017 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are: Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jon Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development. In addition to our press release, we also filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information; both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy, and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. LabCorp delivered another solid quarter to start 2017 with -over-year revenue growth of 5%, adjusted EPS growth of 8%, and excellent free cash flow, and we returned $150 million to shareholders through share repurchases. We made strong progress on our enterprise-wide initiatives and turned in an outstanding performance in the Diagnostics business.","Customers continued to embrace our integrated solutions, as evidenced by two major health system partnerships, a record number of study wins based on combined data, and strong growth in companion diagnostics. In Diagnostics, which represents 70% of our total revenue, we had excellent top line growth with significant increases in total and organic volume, and in revenue per requisition, leading to a 50-basis-point expansion of our industry-leading margins. Our Diagnostics business is the backbone for our strong free cash flow, which we deployed judiciously in the quarter toward investing in the business, returning capital to shareholders, and growing through acquisitions.","In Drug Development, our results were mixed. Although we are disappointed of our first quarter financial performance, we had some bright spots in the quarter. Notably, strong net orders, an improved book-to-bill, and better performance in the clinical business. These are all leading indicators that give us continuing optimism about the long-term growth characteristics of our company in 2018 and beyond.","We continue to invest in the future of the Drug Development business. In the quarter, we again strengthened the leadership team and decided to expand LaunchPad to right-size the business in the near term and create a more scalable technology-enabled business for the future.","As I mentioned a moment ago, the strong growth in areas of strategic focus for the combined business demonstrates that customers are embracing our differentiated offering. I would like to update you on major developments during the quarter that highlight the unmatched value proposition of the combination of LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development.","We stated at the outset of the year that we are focused on the delivery of comprehensive, integrated solutions to our customers' needs. Among the customers who need solutions in today's rapidly-changing healthcare environment are health systems, and this quarter brought two important successes there. We announced an important transaction with Mount Sinai earlier this year that strengthens our position in the New York Metro market, and we agreed on a significant partnership with PAML, a market-leading reference and outreach laboratory based in the Pacific Northwest. Through PAML, we aligned ourselves with two innovative, fast-growing health systems and strengthened our relationships with over ten community-based health systems across multiple states.","Our offering to health systems and large provider groups is unique and extends beyond our multifaceted, lab testing, operational, analytical, and clinical decision support expertise. The integration of our Drug Development solutions is a fundamental component of these relationships, enabling our partners to become research hubs. Patients gain greater access to high-quality care through clinical trials, providers will realize increased revenue tied to patient enrollment, and our biopharma customers will benefit from faster site activation and recruitment capabilities. The level of interest in our combined set of solutions from leading health systems has increased significantly and we continue to be pleased at the very robust set of opportunities.","Another of our unique capabilities is the powerful combination of LabCorp Diagnostics' patients' data and global Covance physician investigator performance data. Through these proprietary datasets, we continue to provide unique insights that help us win orders. During the quarter, the use of LabCorp data played an important role in securing multiple awards with an aggregate value of more than $150 million, by far our strongest quarter to-date. This brings our cumulative orders from the use of LabCorp data to more than $350 million, and I'll provide three concrete examples that highlight how we're using these capabilities to solve problems for our patients and customers.","In the first example, we observed that approximately 18% of type 2 diabetes patients in our database had evidence of moderate kidney disease. We worked with our client on the design of the study protocol, showing them that through minor changes in inclusion and exclusion criteria, we could safely increase the study eligible patient population by over 50%.","In the second example, we identified more than 30,000 patients in our database who were diagnosed in the past five years with myelofibrosis, a rare disease with few treatment options. 40 of these patients had opted in through the LabCorp Patient Portal to receive information about clinical trials, providing an opportunity for direct outreach to these consenting patients. The client cited this capability as a significant factor in the decision to choose Covance.","The fusion of our combined capabilities spawns unique solutions in all stages of Drug Development, including real-world evidence. For example, we partnered with a large customer interested in certain biomarkers associated with use and non-use of a commercially available product. Through this collaboration, Covance screens and enrolls subjects, distributes study kits to patients' homes, collects surveys, coordinates visits to LabCorp patient services for blood draws, runs laboratory tests, and makes reminder calls to subjects. These are the three of many examples of our customers' increasing desire to deploy our innovative solutions only available through LabCorp to solve their real-world problems.","Finally, we continue to drive strong growth across the enterprise with companion diagnostics through additional customer partnerships, increased PD-L1 testing in LabCorp Diagnostics, collaboration on the development of tests tied to new immuno-oncology drugs and indications, as well as the expansion of our CDx offering to neurodegenerative disorders and rare and orphan diseases. As part of our investment in this business, we will open a dedicated companion diagnostics laboratory in North Carolina later this year to address rapidly-growing demand.","The individual business units also had important successes in the quarter. After a comprehensive search, we announced the promotion of Gary Huff to the position of CEO of LabCorp Diagnostics. Gary has more than 25 years of commercial and operational expertise in the clinical laboratory industry. His last two roles before rejoining LabCorp were as Chief Operating Officer of a health system affiliated outreach laboratory, and as CEO of a JV between a commercial laboratory and an academic medical center. So, he brings deep experience with the requirements for success in forming laboratory partnerships with health systems and integrated delivery networks. Gary will join us beginning with our second quarter earnings call.","I mentioned the success of our health system partnership strategy a few moments ago. During the quarter, our Diagnostics business formed a laboratory alliance with HCA in Virginia that will provide reference testing to four hospitals and more than 100 community physicians, optimize HCA's local lab footprint, maintain rapid results on stat testing, and establish a more streamlined lab results interface. In these settings, we are the provider of choice to provide high-quality patient care, integrate high-value IT and analytics tools, and reduce healthcare costs.","We also continued developing our patient-facing capabilities, including improved online appointment scheduling and bill payment capabilities, self-service registration and patient service centers, and a completely revamped Patient Portal. These technologies enable direct communication with LabCorp patients, presenting valuable opportunities to grow our database of about 120,000 patients that have consented to be contacted about future clinical trials. Through continued improvement of the Patient Portal's user experience and refinement of the opt-in process, the rate of patients opting in has doubled, accelerating the value of this strategic differentiator.","We are also implementing system-wide solutions to help patients make financial decisions related to our services. We can now check eligibility for services when the patient is in our facility, create a personalized estimate of the cost of services before a blood draw, and collect any balance due from the patient at the time of service. We also recently launched a Web-based cost estimator for our non-invasive prenatal testing that allows consumers to estimate their cost for testing services based on their health insurance. In combination, these initiatives will improve the patient experience with LabCorp, increase our net promoter scores among our customers, and build customer and brand loyalty.","As part of our initiatives to bring services closer to patients, we are exploring new business models that provide long-term growth opportunities, including piloting mobile phlebotomy, evaluating additional services that we can offer through our PSCs, and investing in innovative at-home collection devices. As you can see, we are driving innovation throughout our Diagnostic offering on many fronts.","Covance Drug Development is the only CRO providing the full spectrum of drug development capabilities, from research to real-world evidence studies, creating commercial and scientific advantage for our partners. During the quarter, we entered into a contract for a full programmatic award of nine Type 2 diabetes studies with a top-tier pharma partner. In this instance, our broad-based alliance involves the delivery of clinical, central lab, and early development solutions. We believe that this powerful end-to-end strategy will yield future cross-functional awards and help us accelerate long-term revenue and profit growth.","In addition, we continue to concentrate our sales efforts on higher value therapeutic areas: oncology, CNS disorders, genetics, and rare and orphan diseases. Our combined company's scientific expertise in these areas is significant, and has driven an increase in the portion of our backlog tied to these therapeutic categories. These developments, combined with our improving orders and book-to-bill ratio, give us continued optimism about Covance's future.","Nonetheless, there is more we can do to improve the delivery of services at Covance. We have therefore decided to expand our highly-successful LaunchPad initiative to include Covance. Through Covance LaunchPad, we will right-size the business, reengineer our Drug Development systems and processes, and deploy technological advancements to improve service while maintaining the highest quality and sustainably reducing our cost base. Glenn will provide financial and other details on this initiative in a few moments.","In closing, we are in the early stages of capitalizing on multiple growth opportunities across our global markets. We are pleased with the success of our solutions-focused selling and our continued progress in repositioning ourselves to meet the needs of a rapidly-changing healthcare system. Driven by the outstanding work of more than 50,000 colleagues around the world, we continue to create unique solutions to our customers' problems, improve the health and lives of patients worldwide, unlock profitable growth, and increase long-term shareholder value.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments, and conclude with an update on our 2017 guidance.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 4.9% over last year, due to solid organic growth in LabCorp Diagnostics and acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 40 basis points. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 2.7%. Operating income for the quarter was $333 million, or 13.8% of revenue, compared to $300 million, or 13%, last year. Adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges, and special items, was $391 million, or 16.2% of revenue, compared to $373 million, or 16.3%, last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to favorable price, mix, and acquisitions, partially offset by higher personnel costs in Covance Drug Development.","The tax rate for the quarter was 31.2% compared to 35.2% last year. The adjusted tax rate excluding special charges and amortization was 31.5%, down from 34.8% last year, primarily due to the expected tax benefit from stock-based compensation. The increase in the tax benefit from stock-based comp was primarily driven by the increase in the company's stock price when shares vested in the first quarter of this year compared to the price when shares vested last year. This benefit was included in our prior full-year tax rate guidance, which we continue to expect to be approximately 34%.","Net earnings for the quarter were $192 million, or $1.84 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges, and other special items, were $2.22 in the quarter, up 8% over last year. Operating cash flow was $234 million in the quarter, compared to $128 million a year ago. The increase of $106 million was primarily due to higher earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditures totaled $72 million, or 3% of revenue, compared to $71 million, or 3.1%, last year. As a result, free cash flow was $162 million in the quarter, up from $56 million last year.","At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $366 million, down from $434 million at the end of 2016. During the quarter, we invested $152 million in acquisitions, and repurchased $150 million of stock. As of March 31, we had $590 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. Total debt at quarter-end was approximately $5.9 billion. The company's leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.1 times gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA, comparable to our leverage ratio at the end of 2016.","Now, I'll review our segment performance beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 8% over last year. The increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions, price, mix, and organic volume, measured by requisitions. Revenue per requisition increased 3.8%, benefiting from price, mix, and the Sequenom acquisition. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing. Total volume increased 4.3%, of which organic volume was 1.8%. Acquisition volume was 2.5%, which was primarily driven by tuck-in acquisitions that have not yet annualized.","LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $341 million, or 19.9% of revenue, compared to 308 million, or 19.4%, last year. The increase in operating income and 50-basis-point margin improvement were primarily due to solid organic revenue growth, acquisitions, and the benefit from our LaunchPad initiative. LabCorp Diagnostics remains on track to achieve its LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the three-year period ending this year.","Now, I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $690 million, a decline of $13 million, or 1.8%, from last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 150 basis points of negative currency, revenue was roughly flat compared to last year. During the quarter, revenue increased in the clinical development business. This increase was offset by the decline in revenue in the early development and central lab businesses, primarily due to slower revenue conversion from the backlog and the previously discussed cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in late-2016 for which we provided central lab services. Execution of our strategy, which is focused on higher value therapeutic areas such as oncology and CNS disorders, resulted in a higher percentage of our backlog tied to complex studies that continue to convert into revenue at a slower pace.","Covance Drug Development's adjusted operating income was $83 million, or 12.1% of revenue, compared to 103 million, or 14.7%, last year. The decline in operating income and margin were primarily due to higher personnel costs, including targeted strategic investments in the clinical business to support future growth, partially offset by cost synergies. We remain on track to achieve our target of $100 million in cost synergies through the three-year period ending this year, as we expect to complete the consolidation of our central lab facilities by the middle of the year.","In addition, the company expanded its LaunchPad initiative to now include Covance Drug Development. This initiative will be a three-year program for Covance that consists of two phases. We recently initiated the first phase to right-size Covance Drug Development's resources, primarily head count and facility footprint. This phase is expected to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $20 million in 2017, and approximately $45 million on an annualized basis thereafter. The pre-tax cost to achieve these savings is estimated to be approximately $30 million in 2017, of which around $20 million is expected to be cash expenditures.","The second phase will focus on reengineering our systems and processes, and improving productivity, which will contribute to sustained margin improvement over time. Planning for the second phase is underway, and we will provide additional details later this year.","Covance Drug Development's net orders and net book-to-bill for the trailing 12 months were $3.2 billion and 1.15, respectively, a sequential improvement over the 12-month period ending December 31, 2016. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of $300 million over year-end backlog and we expect approximately $2.1 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","Now, I'll update our 2017 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of March 31 for the remainder of 2017 and includes the impact of the expansion of LaunchPad in Covance Drug Development, as well as anticipated capital allocation. We expect reported revenue growth of 3.5% to 5% after adjusting for the negative impact from approximately 40 basis points of foreign currency translation. This is lower than our prior guidance by 100 basis points, due to lower than expected revenue growth in Covance Drug Development, partially offset by higher than expected revenue growth in LabCorp Diagnostics.","We expect LabCorp Diagnostics' reported revenue growth of 5% to 7%, after adjusting for the negative impact from approximately 10 basis points of foreign currency translation. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4.5% to 6.5%, primarily due to better than expected organic volume growth. We expect Covance Drug Development reported revenue growth of 0% to 2%, after adjusting for the negative impact from approximately 130 basis points of foreign currency translation, which is lower than our prior guidance by 350 basis points. On a constant currency basis, we expect revenue growth of 1.3% to 3.3%, which is also lower than our prior guidance, primarily due to our first quarter results, as well as the mix of contracted awards won during the quarter.","Critical development orders remain strong and typically take longer to convert into revenue. In addition, our strategy to focus on high value therapeutic areas such as oncology has resulted in a higher percentage of our backlog tied to complex studies that continue to convert into revenue at a slower pace. From a timing perspective, we expect Covance Drug Development's revenue and margins to sequentially increase throughout the year; however, we expect revenue and margins in the second quarter to be down year-on-year before showing favorable growth in the second half of 2017 compared to last year.","Our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance is $9.20 to $9.60, an increase of 4% to 9% over 2016, and lower than our prior guidance of $9.35 to $9.75 due to lower revenue growth expectations. We expect a decline in our earnings outlook to primarily apply to our results in the second quarter, due to the timing of revenue growth and the benefit from the expansion of our LaunchPad initiative in the second half of 2017. In addition, our second quarter results will also be negatively impacted by the timing of the Easter holiday, as well as the year-over-year comparison to leap year. We expect free cash flow to be between $925 million and $975 million, unchanged from our prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. In the interest of time, we ask that everyone please limit themselves to one question then rejoin the queue. Our first question will come from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks very much, and good morning. I just want to go quickly back to Glenn, your comment about favorable growth in margins in the second half. Is that primarily due to the Covance LaunchPad, or is there something else that's going to be driving that?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. No. A couple of things, Lisa. First, I think your reference of Covance, we expect to see sequentially improving revenues as we go throughout the year, even though for the second quarter, we expect revenues to be down year-on-year. The second half will be up in the third and the fourth quarter we expect year-over-year. So that's going to help to drive the improvement.","And then, to your point, in addition with the LaunchPad initiative now moving to Covance, the bulk of the savings in 2017 will be recorded in the second half. So, obviously, that will improve their margins in the third and fourth quarter year-over-year as well.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And I apologize if you already went through this earlier, but I just \u2013 I want to better understand what is happening on the Covance side, especially on the organic side. I think when, Dave, you gave guidance last quarter talking about the organic growth in this business and your expectations around the business, can you maybe just give us a little more color as to what you're seeing in the marketplace. I know when we had a call a few weeks ago, we talked about the fact of in-sourcing, outsourcing, and you weren't really seeing the impact there. We already knew about some of the customer delays and cancellations, but what else is happening in the market?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. I'll take that on, Lisa. This is John. And so, inside the first quarter, you obviously saw a mix of contracted awards that were won and\/or delayed. Clinical orders were strong, to give you color, and that actually takes, obviously, longer to convert into revenue than our early development and\/or even our central labs to a certain extent.","Secondly, we saw within the backlog, we are increasingly raising our penetration within the oncology, CNS, rare and orphan. And this higher percentage of our backlog tied to those complex studies are also converting into revenue at a slightly slower pace. We did see delays in certain key customers' pipelines through the second quarter, third, and fourth. But pleased overall with the net orders that we saw within the quarter in terms the long-term growth.","And specifically based on the data involved with the LabCorp and the Covance areas, we saw our largest quarter to-date, about $150 million in the quarter, about $350 million of new awards in a cumulative due to the combination of the datasets and how that then drove wins within the quarter in terms of the aggregate book-to-bills.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please proceed.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the change in the view at Covance just over the past month. I'm surprised early development was cited as a weak area. Could you talk about the trends there? And then maybe just the magnitude of the weakness for central lab would also be helpful.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Again, John. In terms of the early development, in aggregate, a strong area, but saw certain delays in terms of specific customer pipelines within lead optimization, et cetera. But at the same time, we saw strength in our backlog and book-to-bill. We did have a little bit of a mix of awards to clinical versus pure pre-clinical, and that drove a little bit of the delay in revenue conversion, but a strong area looking at the pipeline of orders going forward and the opportunities that we see in terms of for the balance of the year.","In terms of central labs, we did see a real shut down in those two cancellations within the quarter, and central labs were affected by, what I previously just mentioned, the penetration in oncology. So they are seeing a stretch out in terms of the revenue conversion. And those are really the two areas that we saw affected. I'll proactively address one last question, and that is if you look at our segment, clinical is growing above the actual total Covance revenue growth projected, with the labs and early development below.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That is helpful. And then, Glenn, I want to ask you about the volume growth in the quarter. As you've looked at the numbers, do you think the calendar was a headwind or a tailwind in the quarter, or otherwise, what do you attribute to be the step-up in the activity there?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, no, we did benefit obviously from the, call it, the Easter holiday falling in the second quarter, so it obviously was a year-over-year improvement. The calendarization, interestingly enough, with leap year, really impacts our second quarter much more than the first. So, if you look at the first quarter, a slight tailwind, slight help to the organic volume. It's truly, call it, an improvement in our volume as opposed to just the calendarization. But as we look to the second quarter, you'll see a more substantial headwind for us, between Easter falling into the second quarter, between the calendarization of how it matches up for us year-over-year, you're looking at a more substantial impact, probably around a point-and-a-half give or take on our volume in the second quarter. But for the first quarter, of the 1.8%, call it, 30 basis points, we would consider being, call it, calendarization\/Easter.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. I just wanted to get an update on the contract negotiations that you're doing with United right now. How do we think about the timeline there? And if there's anything of note in terms of relative size as they've grown quite nicely relative to the other managed care organizations over the last two to three years. Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Morning, Nick, it's Dave. Obviously, as we've said, we've been engaged with United at the managed care team level for a significant period of time. They have been a terrific partner to us and I think we've been a terrific partner to them. Over the last six months, we've become also significantly engaged at the senior executive level involving a good deal of my time. And I'm pleased with where we are. Again, I think there's a recognition on both sides of the strength of the partnership and the value of the partnership. We would like to get something done in 2017. I can't give you any further update other than I think both sides are committed to a fair resolution of the contract discussion, and something that rewards us both for the value of the partnership over the now 10-plus years.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then just a quick follow-up in terms of the amount of M&A spend in the quarter, I think it was $150 million or so of M&A activity. Can you maybe just walk us through your pipeline, how you're seeing that evolve over the last 6 to 12 months? Is the pending PAMA legislation driving increased interest from both health systems and others to perhaps look to you guys as an exit strategy? Just want to get your thought on M&A spend, because that was a little bit bigger than we had thought in the quarter. Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think the M&A pipeline continues to be very robust, and I attribute that to the \u2013 not so much to PAMA, because I think singling out any one factor is a little misleading, but to the general change in the healthcare environment. We're seeing a big push to value-based payment. We're seeing a big push to being able to procure services, the highest quality services at the most effective cost. And as hospitals and smaller laboratories are recognizing that trend, I think a lot of them are relooking at, do we belong in this business? Is it a core competency? Are we bringing value to the patient?","So, again, I think when you add in the research capabilities that Covance brings us, we have a strong, differentiated position in doing these really deep, comprehensive hospital partnerships, health system partnerships, and you can expect us to continue to work on those. But we're going to be opportunistic about what's available in the acquisition market and allocate our capital appropriately.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just had a question, I guess, for John first to start off with. So, you had commented about some of the delays that you saw in terms of customer pipeline in both \u2013 I think you said both pre-clinical and clinical. I just was wondering if you could give some context there. Is there anything sort of macro that you could point to that might be driving that or is that customer specific?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, it's customer specific, and nothing macro. It's purely a pause in their very specific pipeline of activities that hit us in one to two areas.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, Dave, just a question for you on the hospital size. So, obviously, you talked about developing deep partnerships. I was curious what your thoughts are around looking at some of the more lab management-type contracts going forward. Is that something that would be of interest to you just moving into more of the in-patient, outpatient side of the business?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, Amanda, lab management can be a part of a comprehensive partnership with a health system. So, we're not opposed to lab management contracts, and we have plenty of them in our business. What we're not out looking for is lab management contracts where essentially the value that we're bringing is remanaging employees and offering supply chain savings. Because in our view, that is not a high margin business. It's well below our operating margins. It's an extremely high touch business, because of the nature of in-patient hospital services. So, pure lab management contracts alone are not particularly attractive to us.","Our strategy has always been the lab management contract might be part of a comprehensive overall partnership that includes, obviously, our reference testing capabilities, our population health capabilities, our analytics capabilities, the Covance piece. So, those are the types of partnerships we're doing, and I think the announcements that you've seen in the quarter with Mount Sinai and with PAML, which are \u2013 again, you have three tremendously innovative market-leading health systems that are deciding that they want to associate themselves with LabCorp, I think that speaks volumes about the success of our hospital strategy.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Please proceed.","Luke Sergott - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys, it's Luke on for Ross today. I \u2013 just to start off on the CRO market, are you seeing any change to the contracts or the RFPs that are out there, specifically, an increase in fee-for-service versus the strategic relationships?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","This is John. I think you're seeing a blend of that, a mix of that. There's certain of the strategics even that have moved to that more functional service provider, more for that fee-for-service that I think you're referencing even within their own mix. It's a vital part of our mix within the Phase II through IV, and we see that playing out with a specific customer set.","But in terms of, if you look across the portfolio, if you're asking is there more of a shift to that, I think we've seen that evolution over the last five years in terms of the use of that model. And you're seeing that continue, but there hasn't been any radical, within the last six months, I'm going to shift to more of that FSP model than prior. But you clearly have to have that in your repertoire in terms of addressing the different models of clinical.","Luke Sergott - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess, lastly, on the pricing market within the CRO business, is that \u2013 are you guys seeing any bad behavior out there when these contracts are up?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No. Have not; have not seen any individual going for share or in terms of low pricing. It's a pretty stable market.","Luke Sergott - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will now come from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. First question: does the reduced outlook in Covance and the implementation of some LaunchPad initiatives there, does that impact at all your appetite to grow that business inorganically, or do you think that's unrelated?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Dan, it's Dave. I just want to point out that the reduced outlook is 1% of a $10 billion revenue company. So, this is not a dramatic reduction, either in our perspective on revenue or on earnings, and it's not in any sense an indication that we are displeased with the Covance business.","I would cite again what I referred to in my prepared remarks. You look at the ways in which the combined organizations are generating business as you don't hear anybody else talking about, the depth of the health system partnerships that we're doing, the use of the data and real examples of how the data is helping us to win the companion diagnostics business, these are terrific success stories, and we're two years into this.","It was a major transformational acquisition, and we are very, very enthusiastic about the long-term opportunity here because the growth rate in the CRO industry has historically been higher than the lab industry, because of the opportunity to expand our business on a more global scale. And so, no, it doesn't in any way diminish our enthusiasm for continuing to grow the CRO business.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful color. Thank you. And just a housekeeping question for Glenn. Glenn, is PAML in the new guidance for 2017, or are you waiting for those parts of the transaction to close before you include them in the guidance?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, no. As we said earlier, just in general, we have capital allocation included in our guidance, including M&A, and I think it's fair to say that, obviously, we announced two health system transactions that we expect both to close this year. So, it's fair to say that we have assumed those transactions would have an impact this year.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, good morning, everybody. So, I guess, I'm just thinking about the current CRO results. Do you think that if you did have a more comprehensive service offering in the market, particularly with greater late-stage development infrastructure, would that help to lift the revenue and EBIT results you're currently generating in the early stage development and the central lab components of your operations? So, is that a big key to success here on the overall CRO odds if you do have more late-stage capabilities? Just curious to get more thoughts on that.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Again, John. I think we actually have very viable late-stage offerings, but at the same time, we know organically we need to push through in certain therapeutic areas, and internationally expansion, and then even embracing some of the new models flowing through. So, we see, obviously, areas of the strategy that we're going to embrace, and I also know within that post-marketing Phase IV area, we do have greater penetration.","And from our vantage point, having early pre-clinical development as well as then central labs does differentiate us from everyone else. I believe that, A, our leadership in labs and ED can bring our clinical business forward, as well as strengthening clinical can then bring forward great penetration within that early development as well. So, it works both ways. But we know we've got work to do on the expansion territories in that late-stage area and those what I just addressed.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And you mentioned a new model, late stage. I'm pretty sure I know what you're talking about, but maybe just to avoid any confusion, do you want to clarify what you're thinking about new models in terms of servicing clients on late-stage?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I think as you've seen, more and more, we're moving to much more of a risk-based model; moving to more and more of a pricing based on value, based on outcomes, et cetera. And so, that's one point of reference. There's different channels off of the FSP model that we were talking about before being addressed. These are at their infant state, but at the same time, you need to be prepared for those, and then move those forward within the scope of your total portfolio.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please proceed.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just on the Covance side, you mentioned higher personnel costs, and I think you brought that up last quarter as well, in terms of, I guess, increased sales force costs. Is there anything else maybe driving those pressures? If there is, where is that coming from and sort of how do you combat that? And then, more broadly, if you can give us maybe where you are thinking in terms of long-term margin profile at this point on the CRO side of the business. Thank you.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","From the standpoint of \u2013 yes, there were specifically strategic investments that were put through all of last year in terms of whether it's in the sales force, whether it's in certain of the therapeutic areas, whether it was on staffing clinical to the backlog. At the same time, any time you have those personnel on board and then you have now flat revenues within the first quarter, then obviously, you have to address that. And so, in terms of your comment on combating that, that's the referenced first phase of a Covance LaunchPad, which there's a $45 million annualized savings, and at the same time, then around $20 million, $25 million in the second half of the year for 2017, and those \u2013 the majority being resources. So, clearly, what you're trying to do is align revenues with the resources.","Longer term, I think from the vantage point of longer-term margins, we obviously see the business models of our competitors and know we have room to move on that. We'll obviously be addressing that in terms of, A, the LaunchPad, longer term initiatives that we'll give more details on to the later part of this year.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, Dave, any updated thoughts on PAMA at this point, just given recent news there?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, at the ACLA annual meeting, there was actually a presentation by CMS about data collection, and then we met with some CMS officials \u2013 industry representatives met with CMS officials and talked about we were continuing to have difficulty loading data. And we requested a delay, and that delay was granted, as you saw, to continue to put the data in. So, that is a positive. I continue to be, and I think our team continues to be frustrated that the data collection process is not designed in a terribly efficient way, and the amount of data that will be generated is going to be enormous. So, it raises the question of can the data be analyzed in a meaningful way between now and when CMS is supposed to put the proposed rule out?","I think more fundamentally, Ralph, the issue continues to be the incorrect definition of applicable laboratories. The definition that the prior rule came up with is inconsistent with the legislative intent, it's inconsistent with floor colloquy, and we supported, that is we the industry, supported PAMA as a way to bring market-based pricing to our industry. But the way the rule has been generated, 95% of the hospitals are not going to be included, which means their commercial pricing, which is multiples above ours, is not going to be considered to be part of the \"market.\"","There's an irony there, because when we talk about acquisitions, the hospital systems are considered to be part of the market, but when we talk about the PAMA pricing, hospital systems are not considered to be part of the market. So, we continue to push with CMS to revisit the definition, and we're hopeful that they will do that, and that we'll, as a result, get a rule and an implementation of the legislation that's consistent with what Congress and the industry agreed that we wanted to do.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Good morning, everyone. This is Alex Nowak on for Bill today. This one's for John. So, I just want to be clear. You issued 2017 guidance at the end of February. And so, should we read into that, that you saw a number of more complex orders come in, or a number of higher mix contracts come in that just took longer to convert over the timeframe, over the March timeframe, and that's what's forcing to you lower your Covance guidance? I guess what I'm getting at is, basically, what happened today versus two months ago?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","The answer is we did see a higher level of clinical orders, which obviously take longer to convert. We did see higher percentage of the actual orders going in that were oncology-, CNS-based, which are obviously converting into revenues at a slower pace. We had delays in the eCustomer pipeline that happened in that last 60 days that were more tactical based. So, those are the reason why the reduced outlooks within the Covance revenue.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And it's Dave. I just want to add quickly, because we want to be clear about this. It's not only the late-stage business that's affected by the mix of oncology, CNS. If we have a central lab study that is doing oncology testing, then enrollment may be slower than it is for, for example, an infectious disease study or a diabetes study. So, the change in mix affects all of the segments of the business; it doesn't just affect the clinical late-stage business.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a second question for you, Dave. Any update on BeaconLBS? And just curious, does your UnitedHealth in-network contract, does that also include the BeaconLBS program?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","In terms of BeaconLBS, we're very focused on improving the features and function sets, as we think about scaling BeaconLBS to new markets. The Texas situation remains the same. That is, BeaconLBS is running there, but the \"hard implementation\" where denials start is not in effect. I didn't quite understand the second part of the question. So, maybe you could just repeat that really quickly because it's five of, and there's four people still waiting.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah. Yeah. Just curious, does the in-network contract that you have with UnitedHealthcare, does that also include BeaconLBS? I guess what I'm trying to read is, if you don't re-sign with UnitedHealthcare for in-network, does that also inhibit you to run the BeaconLBS program?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No. BeaconLBS is a separate company, and so it's not tied to the United contract. Obviously, United has been very supportive of BeaconLBS and has been very much engaged in its development, and is our partner in its implementation, but it's not a part of the United contract.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess maybe just to go back to the LaunchPad initiative with respect to Covance and how we should think about that longer term, obviously, with the near term shortfall in the business, I can understand the need to reduce costs. But I guess how should we think about that longer term and how that might impact your ability to thrive in that market?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Gary, it's Dave. So, I'm just going to point to the successes of LaunchPad in the LabCorp business and how it's improved our competitive position. We've redeployed resources for the customer-facing positions. We've reduced facilities and consolidated facilities in a way that's improved quality and service. Our customer satisfaction scores among our provider community are at all-time highs, even after two years of LaunchPad, which means it's improving the quality of the service we've delivered; it's not diminishing it in any way.","The technology improvements in terms of patient self-service, the revenue cycle system, the bad debt improvement, all of these things are direct outgrowths of LaunchPad, and obviously Propel has been a major innovation and improvement in quality and service. So, LaunchPad is not a program that just says, we're going to rip costs out of the business. LaunchPad is a program that says, every dollar that we spend in the business, we're going to get $1.05 of value in some way or another.","And so, I don't think you should think about LaunchPad as hurting our competitive positioning. Covance LaunchPad is going to improve our competitive positioning through right-sizing facilities, through getting the right employees facing the customer in the right place, through improvement of quality and service delivery, through better technology and tools. All of these things are going to be positive for the business in the long term. And, frankly, we wouldn't invest in doing the LaunchPad project, because it requires a lot of work from the team, if we didn't believe in the business long term.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess it just seems like it's a little bit more reactive here or it was a little bit more proactive in the Diagnostics business.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I don't agree with the characterization.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, the first question, just on the clinical side: one of the questions we're getting from investors is whether the pharma companies are starting to do a lot more \u2013 or more of in-sourcing, so bringing some of the trial business back in house. So, also we are seeing some anecdotal evidence from the tool companies that are actually seeing demand from pharma. So, I would like to hear kind of like your thoughts of what you think kind of like the sponsors are doing, and how they're thinking about in-sourcing versus outsourcing trial work.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think \u2013 and this is John, again. I really haven't seen that, at least on our spectrum of customers. You'll always have \u2013 so I went to head of business of one pharma just recently, where that rumble was that they were going to pull and in-source resources ahead of the meeting, and it was the head of the business plus the head of procurement. Once I got into the meeting, it was not about that at all. They were consolidating the CROs who they work with, and we were one of those that they were consolidating to.","And so, I do hear of some rumble about that, it just hasn't \u2013 I haven't seen that with our customer set in terms of the in-sourcing \"penetration\" or backwards moving into pharma. I can't talk to customers I'm not at, and so you'll have to ask the others of my brethren in terms of that, but right now, we haven't seen that, still see an ever-increasing penetration, whether it's in the mid-tier, or biotech, or in that large pharma and as an industry, trim.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then kind of like you're talking about the fact that it's taking longer to convert into revenues, and that is something that you guys have been talking about for over a year-and-a-half now. Just, if you can just give us some more context, is it taking longer to convert because you as a CRO and your CRO peers just are seeing more difficulty in recruiting patients, or is it taking longer to convert because of the customer side and the drug companies that are just kind of like pacing \u2013 slowing their pace?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, I would say neither. It's more complex trials at the heart of it. So, more complex protocols within the oncology area, within the rare and orphan disease area. It also takes longer in terms of a Phase III recruitment, yes, as opposed to infectious disease, when you're looking at an oncology trial, et cetera. So, the orientation of the pipeline to those areas more and more give you a longer revenue conversion","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then the last question on...","Scott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, no, that's it. That's it. Sorry, Ricky, but we've got two more people waiting, and you had two, and it's after 10:00. So, let's move on, please. We'll take whatever you have offline.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the CRO side, we've heard a lot of discussion on certain assets that you guys probably would be interested in to bolster that business. As you prioritize international expansion and clinical capabilities, Asia being a perfect example, I mean, how would you rank what you're looking for in terms of what you see the need for the business to turn around and strengthen?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Brian, it's Dave, good morning.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hi, Dave.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We've been talking about this quite a bit, so I'm not going to say anything that I haven't said multiple times. The clinical CRO business, we do need to be more sizable in Asia Pac, so that is one important consideration. It's only one. We want to acquire the asset that's going to fit us best from a strategic perspective. That involves financial returns. That involves cultural fit. That involves long-term opportunity where we see the business growing in therapeutic areas. So, there are multiple factors that we take into consideration, but you're certainly correct that Asia Pac is one.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, Dave, what exactly about Asia stands out as driving that view?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I think probably the biggest thing about Asia is there are a number of significant markets there that require data from their particular subjects, and if we don't have the clinical presence in those markets, it's tough to win the studies. So, it's mostly a function of large customers there in Japan and Korea, for example, large market opportunities, and regulatory environment in which they want to see \u2013 and, of course, I should mention China as well \u2013 and regulatory environment in which they want to see specific data relating to their populations.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right. Got it. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks, guys. So, wanted to follow up on PAMA. You guys went through some of the things you are dealing with. I'm interested in your perspective regarding how you think the rest of the market and particularly the small independent labs and the hospital labs, are preparing for the implementation. Obviously, we don't know for sure, but hopefully next year. Just curious if you think about just how you'd grade the preparedness among your competitors, what that means for you.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I don't really have a good perspective on that, Isaac. It's Dave. I mean, I know what we hear when we go to ACLA, but I think there's a surprising lack of awareness of the potential impact of PAMA, for example, is my perception, in the hospital lab director environment. I think small labs are for the most part, at least the leaders of them that I talk to, are aware of the potential outcomes. I don't know where they are in terms of preparedness or data submission. That's not something that we talk about with our peers.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the impact, we know the perspective walk on future reimbursement, but if we just think about maybe the first 12 months, if all goes according to your best expectations, do you think the net effect of incremental volume will be neutral or positive to our ASPs, or is it too hard to say?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I think we should be clear, and we tried to be clear, that if PAMA is implemented based on the rule that's out there, there will be a reduction in the Medicare and clinical lab fee schedule. So, it's very hard, no matter how much volume you get, to offset a price reduction in a book of business of that size. So, I would not expect if PAMA gets implemented in January that we will offset the financial impact of the fee schedule reduction with incremental volume.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over back to Dave King for closing comments and remarks. Sir?","David P.

My name is Reggie, and I'll be your conference operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to the host for today's call, Mr. David King, Chairman and CEO. Please proceed.","David P. King","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today from LabCorp are Brad Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; Adam Feinstein, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy; and Steve Anderson, Vice President, Investor Relations.","This morning we will discuss our second quarter 2012 financial results, update our 2012 guidance, highlight our progress on our Five Pillar Strategy and provide answers to several frequently asked questions.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Anderson who has a few comments before we begin.","Stephen Anderson","Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via the telephone and Internet. Please refer to today's press release for replay information.","This morning, the company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information. Additionally, we refer you to today's press release, which is available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS, adjusted EPS excluding amortization, free cash flow and adjusted operating income. I would also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call.","These forward-looking statements include, among other statements about -- among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from the Genzyme Genetics and other acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the company's financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2011 10-K and subsequent filings. The company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now Brad Hayes will review our financial results.","William B. Hayes","Thank you, Steve. On today's call, I will review 4 key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. Also review our updated 2012 guidance.","First, cash flow. Our cash flow remains strong. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2012, were $749.5 million, excluding the Hunter Labs settlement. We remain pleased with our cash collections. DSO was 47 days at the end of June, a decrease of 1 day sequentially and an increase of 1 day year-over-year. During the quarter, we maintained our bad debt rate of 4.4%.","Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 1.4% year-over-year in the second quarter. During the quarter, revenue per requisition increased 1.5% year-over-year. Total company volume was essentially flat year-over-year during the second quarter. Esoteric volume increased approximately 1.3% in the quarter.","Third, margin. For the second quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 19.7% compared to 19.9% in the second quarter of 2011. The decline in adjusted operating income margin is due to a 30-basis-point drag from recent acquisitions that we've not fully integrated.","Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of June, we had cash of $124.4 million and $510 million available under our credit facility. During the second quarter, we repurchased $130.3 million of stock, representing 1.5 million shares. Year-to-date, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for $252.6 million. At the end of June, $332 million of repurchase authorization remained under our share repurchase program. This morning, we updated our 2012 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of 2% to 3%; adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, in the range of $6.80 to $7, excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after June 30, 2012; operating cash flow of approximately $950 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $155 million.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Brad. We are pleased with our performance, given that we continue to face a very difficult environment for volume growth. During the quarter, we grew earnings per share by nearly 8% year-over-year. We continued to integrate our recent acquisitions and focus on expense control, lowering our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue by 90 basis points year-over-year, adjusted for the Hunter Labs settlement and Orchid legal expenses in 2011. And we extended our contract with WellPoint on a multi-year basis, stable pricing and continued exclusivity in our key markets.","We continue to make significant progress on each aspect of our Five Pillar Strategy. The first pillar of our strategy is that we deploy our cash to enhance our footprint and test menu through acquisitions and to repurchase shares. In June, we announced our intended acquisition of MEDTOX Scientific, a premier forensic and clinical laboratory with a diverse test menu and a reputation for exceptional quality, dependability and customer service. This acquisition gives us a great foundation for growth in our specialized toxicology testing, as we build and expand our Toxicology Center of Excellence.","The transaction has received FTC clearance, and we expect to close as soon as customary closing conditions are met, including the approval of MEDTOX's shareholders. The integrations of Integrated Genetics and Integrated Oncology and Orchid Cellmark continue to go well and are in line with our expectations. We continue to realize synergies on schedule and to offer new services in genetics and oncology. Finally, we have repurchased 2.9 million shares at a cost of $252.6 million year-to-date.","The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. We continue to see strong growth in the adoption of our Beacon platform, which is now deployed to more than 14,500 sites and has more than 66,000 users. We added a number of features to Beacon in the second quarter, and we will add more analytical ordering and reporting capabilities, specifically for physicians and hospitals, later this year.","We successfully completed the pilot of our Beacon patient portal and received positive customer feedback. The portal is a secure and easy-to-use online solution that enables patients to receive and share lab results, make appointments, pay bills, set up automatic alerts and notifications and manage health information for the entire family. We continue to see rapid adoption, with more than 2,000 new patient registrations each week, and we remain on track to launch the portal nationwide later this year.","We continue to improve our electronic medical record connectivity. We have added over 3,500 new client EMR interfaces year-to-date and are on pace to exceed 7,500 in 2012. We continue to pursue our open platform strategy, allowing our customers to connect seamlessly to LabCorp directly or via the EMR of choice. We continue to expand the capabilities of our Beacon platform to deliver data aggregation and advanced analytics services, including LabCorp datasets alongside diagnostic guidelines, prescription data and hospital information to aid physicians and health care administrators in treatment and population management. These new data sources our industry-leading services that should assist our customers in multiple ways, as they seek to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care.","The third pillar of our strategy is to continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. We are pleased to report the LabCorp Touch accessioning and workflow tool is now installed in over 1,500 locations, and deployment is nearing completion. LabCorp Touch, including AccuDraw, automates key aspects of our specimen collection, improving quality by reducing secondary collections by 50% and significantly reducing accessioning labor. Additionally, Touch and our enhanced logistics capabilities allow us to move specimens more rapidly through our supply chain, widening our lab-testing windows and improving turnaround times.","We have expanded our patient self-service offerings through 2 key enhancements. First, our online appointment scheduling system now allows patients to enter demographic and insurance information, reducing their registration time at our PSCs and enhancing our efficiency and their experience.","Second, in select markets, we have introduced the telephonic voice recognition system to schedule appointments in our Patient Service Centers. We began the rollout of the Vantage positive ID system in our histology testing division. The system will improve quality, standardize workflow and enhance throughput across all of our histology operations. We anticipate the rollout of the Vantage system to last approximately 18 months. We are preparing to pilot our splitting and sorting robotic system, which we call Propel [ph], over the next several months. We are excited about this opportunity to enhance efficiency and quality.","The fourth pillar of our strategy is to continue scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We introduced new test and collaborate with leading companies and academic institutions to provide our physicians and patients with the most scientifically advanced testing in our industry.","We recently launched an age-based guideline initiative for cervical cancer and STD screening. This innovative age-based test protocol aids physicians in ordering cervical cancer and sexually transmitted disease screening tests. Clinicians  can now select a test number that will individualize cervical cancer and STD testing, based on the patient's age and corresponding test protocol as published in the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines.","We continue to enhance offerings in the new swab family of tests. New swab allows us to perform multiple women's health tests selected by the ordering physician from a single-collection swab. We are the only laboratory that has validated each test we offer on a precise collection device used for new swab testing, meaning that doctors and patients can be assured of the highest quality results to guide diagnosis and treatment.","In May, we announced our collaborative relationship with Ariosa Diagnostics, for which we offer an innovative non-invasive test for detection of common fetal trisomies using DNA in maternal blood. The test is performed using a maternal blood draw, taken at a doctor's office or Patient Service Center, and provide accuracy approaching that of invasive testing for common fetal trisomies.","The fifth pillar of our strategy is to develop alternative delivery models. We continue to discuss alternative models with managed care partners, health systems and physician groups. And our Beacon Lab Benefit Solution product will be operationally available next quarter to better meet their needs. Our goal in this initiative is to provide payors, health systems and physicians with a variety of options to improve laboratory quality, reduce treatment costs and improve patient outcomes.","In summary, we are pleased with the quarter and the progress we have achieved on our Five Pillar Strategy.","Now Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.","Stephen Anderson","Thank you, Dave.","Can you describe the impact of the Medicare reimbursement cuts you will face in 2013?","Absent any additional congressional action through the end of the year, we would anticipate an approximate 5% reduction to the clinical lab fee schedule beginning January 1, 2013. The Affordable Care Act baseline for the 2013 update, the clinical lab fee schedule, will be a negative 0.95%, based on the recently published CPI-U and productivity adjustment figures. As part of the Sustainable Growth Rate fix, the clinical lab fee schedule will be re-baselined an additional 2% lower, effective January 1, 2013. Further, absent any congressional activity, mandatory sequestration will impose an additional 2% reduction in the clinical lab fee schedule, effective January 1, 2013. Together, these cuts sum to an approximate 5% cut to the clinical lab fee schedule, which represents approximately 12% of our total revenue. In addition to the reduction in the clinical lab fee schedule, mandatory sequestration will impose a 2% reduction in the physician fee schedule, effective January 1, 2013. The physician fee schedule represents approximately 2% of our total revenue.","Can you update us on the status of the inquiry you received from the Senate Finance Committee?","LabCorp continues to work closely with the staff of the Senate Finance Committee to respond to their request for information. We were the first company to meet with the committee staff shortly after receiving their letter asking us to provide a responsive overview of how our contracts with managed care organizations work. We continue to work closely with the staff to respond to their inquiry.","Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing?","For the year, approximately 40% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. As we reiterated last quarter, our goal is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 45% of our revenue within the next 3 to 5 years.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve. Thank you very much for listening. We are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is a little disorienting with Adam not getting the first question. I asked this question on the earlier call, but there's a lot of discussion continuing around pricing pressure and for a very long time, there was pricing stability. And I don't know exactly when, but it seems like 5 or 6 years ago, we started to see pressure on price. So maybe could you comment about, is there a path back towards pricing stability and what are the challenges of getting there?","David P. King","Yes. Gary, I guess -- it's Dave. I guess I would characterize it a little differently, which is, there was -- I think, as everybody remembers in 2007 and 2008, a fairly sizable pricing reset and my view is that since that time, pricing has been quite stable. And that, on both a unit cost and a mix basis, pricing has generally been positive. So I look at other industries, probably aside from pharmaceuticals and health care services, and I see a trend where unit pricing -- I mean, you look at imaging, at hospital services, look at physician services, I see a trend where unit pricing has been fairly steadily going down. Whereas for us, unit pricing has been relatively flat and in a couple of years, unit pricing has been positive. So our pricing in this quarter was positive, and we're happy about that. And we continue to make every effort to be disciplined on pricing, given the surrounding environment.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up to that would be, with the -- assuming the Accountable Care Act is implemented, what kind of impact do you see on your overall unit pricing from the implementation of health care reform?","David P. King","I just think it's -- I think it's too early to hypothesize about what's going to happen to price. There are too many variables that are in play. For example, it's been widely discussed that employers may decide not to continue to extend coverage and pay the penalty instead. If that happened, and employees go to the exchanges, I mean, that has one potential pricing impact. You have potentially more patients in Medicaid, which has unit pricing implications if they're uninsured now or if they're outside the system. So I just think it's too early to tell what implications the ACA would have for price, because there are too many moving pieces.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy of William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","This is a follow-up to some comments, Dave, that you made about the alternative delivery models. I'm curious, how -- what are you seeing these days in terms of managed care's efforts to manage lab spend? How willing are they to adopt their type of models? And typically, how do we think about those models impacting the P&L, relative to current models?","David P. King","I think that there is increasing focus in managed care on lab trend, not so much on lab spend, because as we have always said, the spend is 3% of total health care expenditure, although we provide a heck a lot more than 3% of the value. But I think there is increasing focus on trend, and the trend is utilization. And it's also what tests are being selected. So I think, in a appropriate way managed care, and it's not just only managed care by the way, it's integrated delivery networks, it's health systems, are focused on what tests are being ordered and why are the tests being ordered and are they being ordered from the right provider. So I think there is more willingness to approach these issues. Like everything, there's a implementation period, there's a learning curve. And we're still in the early stages of what I would describe as managed care and hospitals and delivery networks and health systems and even physician groups implementing a more focused approach to how tests are ordered.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So just thinking, over the next couple of years, how do we think about the offsetting factors of -- I think there has been a lot of discussion about hospitals purchasing physician practices and how those test volumes are that the -- I guess the referral source changes the direction of the test volume. And then, you think about hospitals selling their outreach businesses and some of the things you talked about. I mean, how do you -- how you rationalize all of those and think about the impact to volumes over the next couple of years? Does one seem like it's standing out more than the other?","David P. King","So obviously, we've talked about it, and it's been widely discussed that health systems, I would describe them as big health systems, are purchasing physician practices as well as other -- a significant number of other types of services as well, which has the potential to redirect the flow of lab specimens. On the other hand, it also has the potential to significantly increase the cost of the lab expense to the payors and even the internal costs of the laboratory services that the health systems are now providing to the physicians. So to me, the increasing focus on reducing the overall cost of care and on directing, not only lab work but all services to the highest quality and most efficient provider, benefits us because I think we're the highest quality and most efficient provider.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then just last one, if you think about volumes over the past few years, they've been -- it's been a challenging environment just given the macro situation. How do you think about -- if you put reform aside for a second, how do you think about this general utilization of patients? Is this something that you think is a fundamental shift in how people are using healthcare? Or is this something that you think, as the macro environment theoretically improve, then we could see better utilization levels?","David P. King","I've always maintained that as the macro environment improves that we will see improved utilization levels. And I continue to hold that view. It certainly is the case that we're in a period of low-volume growth. That's the environment and so it requires us to manage the business very well to be able to continue to be successful. But we're also in a very, very tough macro environment with a lot overhang of high unemployment and the economy not picking up steam the way that economists and everybody else thought that it would. And I do think that has the effect of muting the use of health care services generally and lab services specifically.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions here. The first is just on organic growth. Could you comment a little bit on what you think your underlying organic growth was in the quarter, if you x out some of the smaller acquisitions that you made over the last 12 months?","William B. Hayes","Darren, this is Brad. If we go back in and look at that -- the schedule we prepared to look at the organic growth, I'm going to speak to the volume metric, that volume in the second quarter was down 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And if you could just maybe comment a little bit more about the drivers of the organic growth trends, are you seeing anything that are worth pointing out in either bucket, any test categories, anything that would help put this deceleration into perspective?","William B. Hayes","Sure, 2 things come to mind that are drivers. One is vitamin D. And the vitamin D test, as you know, grew quickly for several years, and it has since flattened out. So I think that is challenging to the growth rate of overall volume. The other is in our histology area. We see continued weakness from a volume perspective in the histology category of our business. And I think they are some of the trends that we've talked about in the past, are still with us and impacting our experience there.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just specific to histology, is there a deterioration versus what -- we've heard about in the past, is it still kind of a single-digit decline?","David P. King","Darren, it's Dave. I think it's just a continuation of the trend.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, the other question I had is just stepping back. And Dave, I know you've made comments to investors and analysts over time just about the decelerating growth and the overall environment. As you think about that more and look at the company's capital structure, if this trend persists, how seriously would you consider dividend on top of share repurchase? It seems like we're looking at much more GDP-like growth, and that may be deserving of a dividend for your shareholders.","David P. King","Darren, I mean, we've talked about this frequently in the last 18 months and have said that our goal is to make a decision on this issue of whether to initiate a dividend at the end of this year. I think one of the confounding factors in terms of the idea of introducing a dividend is if what I'm reading in the press is accurate and nothing changes in the tax structure next year, the potential marginal tax rate on dividends could be 45%. And so that, in my view, really takes away from the attractiveness of a dividend. So some of this is going to depend on what are -- what is Congress and the executive branch going to do and are they going to be able to come to any agreement about the tax structure? And the second is what do we see in the environment.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, last thing here, just maybe a comment on strategy. It seems like one of the bigger market share opportunities for the big labs still remains to be hospital business. And I know you've commented a little bit in this, but maybe can you just update us maybe more specifically on how you're approaching that market? What types of things you're working on there that might allow you to capture share in that realm?","David P. King","Yes. And I think when we think about the system, the system is certainly becoming -- the health care system is becoming more health system centric. I would not -- I think hospitals are becoming more than hospitals. Hospitals own physician practices. They own urgent cares. They own acute care facilities. They own imaging facilities. So hospitals are transforming themselves into integrated delivery networks, broader health systems. And I continue to believe that we have all the tools in place. We have all the right strategies to demonstrate to hospitals and health systems that we can improve the quality of the laboratory services and ultimately of the patient care that's delivered, and we can help them reduce their costs. I think some of it is that the health systems also need to increase their awareness of the savings and quality improvement opportunities. Managed care payors need to increase their awareness of the savings and quality improvement opportunities. And we need to continue to refine the message and refine the financial analytics that demonstrate that. So I think there's some -- there's opportunities on all sides of the equation. But I continue to believe that we're extremely well positioned to benefit from what we're all going to see, which is in the next several years, which is, there is going to be pressure to reduce costs. The higher-cost, less-efficient providers are going to be disadvantaged. And the more-efficient providers, particularly the high-quality, more-efficient providers like LabCorp, are going to be in a strong position.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. First -- the first one is more focused on the near term. If you can just detail for us what would be the impact of the MEDTOX acquisition on pricing metric in the second half of the year.","David P. King","Ricky, we -- since we haven't closed, we haven't incorporated any of the MEDTOX numbers into our evaluation. You can -- obviously, MEDTOX is a public company, so you can look at their revenues and their reported price and do that math. But it's not something that we're incorporating into our outlook for the rest of the year until we actually close.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But if we just think about it, if we -- about the trends, should we think of it as a headwind or a tailwind to second half as we kind of work it through our model?","David P. King","I actually don't know, because I have not looked at their -- I believe their PPA is comparable to ours. But, again, it's a publicly reported number, and so it -- the calculation should be relatively easy to do.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just going to talk longer term, as we think about stuff like industry growth and I think you commented earlier on your expectation for volume to go back to kind of like historical rates as the economy improves. So when you think about stuff like top line growth and the mix between volume and the price, should we get to kind of like historical 45% top line growth just from core business fundamentals improving? Or are you looking to augment top line growth with complementary acquisitions and not necessarily kind of affecting core business but just looking outside core and what would you look as -- see as complementary?","David P. King","So we've always said our foundation model was 4% to 6% top line growth. It's a combination of volume, price and some small fold-in acquisitions, and that continues to be our view of the long-term opportunity. When we think about complementary acquisitions, you can't say yes and you can't say no, hypothetically, to anything without having had the chance to evaluate it. I wouldn't be -- so I wouldn't rule out something that would be highly complementary to what we do. And over time, we've done some of those things. They've been very small. For example, we've acquired small IT companies that provided capabilities to do things that we felt it was easier to buy than build. So I wouldn't rule anything out. But I think each one we would have to evaluate on a case-by-case basis. We would have to determine, is it complementary to our core competencies, does it give us the opportunity to advance our strategy, do we have the management capabilities to run it? Those are the factors that we obviously -- what would the return be and how will we -- how would this add value to shareholders? And those would be the things that we would evaluate in any situation where we look into that -- where we looked at a complementary acquisition.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But would it be fair to say that for the time being, you still -- your key focus is on the more small fold-in acquisitions?","David P. King","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Gavin Weiss, in for Lisa. And hopefully, this will go a little bit more smoothly than our performance on the last call. But in the press release, you noted that you expect Genzyme to be slightly accretive, which I believe is consistent with what you said previously. But can you clarify if there have been any changes in your expectations for Genzyme? Is it more or less accretive than you previously thought?","David P. King","I didn't listen to the last call but obviously, there's something I need to go back and listen to, I guess. No, our expectations for Genzyme have not changed in terms of what we set out at the beginning of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick clarification, one on vitamin D. Is there something in there beyond just sort of the comps there that you think is driving the slowdown? And specifically, what I'm wondering is, did see any signs of pushback from payors with regards to the amount of vitamin D testing that gets done?","David P. King","Isaac, it's Dave. There have been some proposals by a couple of the Medicare carriers to impose diagnosis-related requirements on Vitamin D. They certainly are not material to the overall utilization. I think what's happened is, we have reached a plateau in vitamin D, which is that there was tremendous growth as there was widespread physician adoption. Now the test is largely adopted. The utilization is what -- is where physicians think it's appropriate, and so we've just seen it flatten  off.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe if I could ask a more structural question. Long term, we're obviously in a -- based on the economic forecast, sort of for protracted period of sluggishness -- and so [indiscernible] that continues to be a headwind for volumes. How do you look at maybe taking the asset base you have? You obviously touched millions and millions of people in the health care system. Are there other verticals that you might consider expanding into? You've obviously bolted on with incremental capabilities. I'm just trying to think out of the box here regarding other ways in which you can try and monetize the access you have to the health care system.","David P. King","I think, as I've said in response to Ricky's question, we always look at things that might be interesting that could be complementary. Again, the question is, is it going to create value for shareholders? Are we going to get an acceptable rate of return on invested capital? Do we have the -- does it fit with our core competencies? Does it -- is it -- do we have the capability -- the management capabilities to run these things? And obviously, I mean, we've all read the reports of a number of recent acquisitions that one could argue or, if not outside the fairway, at least on the edges of the fairway for some sizable services businesses, we continue to look at opportunities. I don't have anything specific that I can't point to and say, this is a terrific opportunity for us. But we continue to look at what might be out there in the marketplace that we would have the capabilities to run and that would enhance value for our shareholders.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And you guys talked at maybe a board level sort of a horizon. I mean, if we're in a period of protracted sluggishness -- I mean, there sort of becomes sort of this question of if rates stay low, there's tons of cash flow in the business. And I understand the comment on returns. But I mean, we've seen a lot of other adjacencies in health care, where companies maybe taking a short-term hit to returns in the interest of a long-term strategic shift. And if we sort of stand this current volume environment, is there a deadline here where you might start to revisit your hurdles there and then pivot into a new business?","David P. King","I think it -- I'm not going to comment on what we talk about at the board. I think at every level of the company, we consistently review our strategic focus. And we review what the business opportunities are in health care services generally and the laboratory industries specifically. I'm hesitant to say that there's a deadline by which we're going to do something, simply because we're in a rapidly changing environment and, granted, we're in a low growth environment. But with 2014 ahead, if the ACA is implemented, there can be dramatic change in the overall health care environment. And as I've mentioned earlier on the call, we're in an environment in which the center of gravity in health care services is moving towards broader integrated delivery networks and broader health systems, larger and larger physician groups. These are all things that continue to evolve, and we're going to continue to evolve with them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First, just wanted to congratulate Adam again on joining the company. Dave, not to beat a dead horse on the volume environment, but I was just wondering if there is any way you can quantify or how much of this do you think is cyclical versus structural?","David P. King","I think it will be hard to -- it's hard to come up with a number, Kevin. I mean, if we look back at the first quarter of 2011, when I think people had the general sense that the economy was getting better, that we were kind of coming out of the 2009, 2010 funk, organic volume growth was about 3%. Pretty good. Very good. As we went through 2011, and it became clear to -- I think that we weren't coming out of the funk and that, in fact, Europe was going into the funk, and employment was not improving and the fundamentals of the U.S. economy were not really  getting much better, we saw organic growth decline. And then the beginning of this year again we had a little bit of a pickup, and this quarter we saw a decline. So I continue to believe that the data suggest that when the economy gets better, we are going to return to better utilization trends. There's no question that there is more focus on cost management and on utilization management in every aspect of health care services than there was 3 years ago. But I still think this is more cyclical and less structural.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just going back to the molecular diagnostic initiatives that have been put in place by Palmetto and the new codes that are coming out in 2013. I don't think you guys have ever really quantified what percent of your revenues might be impacted by this. Could you give us any update on that?","David P. King","Yes. I mean, let me just say, as I think I've said a number of times, this -- in our view, first of all, we support enhanced transparency in billing and coding. The amount of molecular testing that is billed to Medicare is quite small, and this is not a material component of our revenue. And it also is not going to have a material impact on our financials.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then just last question, could you give us an update on the managed care contracts? I think Humana was coming up at the end of this year. Has that been renewed? And then, you have, what, Cigna and WellPoint next year?","David P. King","Well, Humana is coming up at the end of this year, and we're deep in discussions with Humana. Cigna is the middle of next year, and we're in discussions with Cigna as well. And as we mentioned earlier on this call, we extended WellPoint on a multi-year basis with stable pricing and retaining exclusivity in all of our key markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor of Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","One question I want to ask about -- you may have talked about this and I missed it, but what are the trends on test per requisition or ascension and -- accession and what really drives that? Is that just product selection as the primary driver on that?","William B. Hayes","Gary, it's Brad. We continue to see an increase in that trend. If we look back over a long time of history, it has continued to go up. So I would say that just new tests, I mean, vitamin D would be a good example that we've talked about many times on the call today. New tests or tests that have a new or -- application or new use in the practice of medicine, we believe, drives that trend. The other thing that's helping or -- that trend, I believe, is the aging population. Because we do know from looking at our different parts of our business that older patients receive more tests per encounter than do younger patients. So I think it's -- it has many factors. But the ones I just mentioned, I think, are the primary drivers.","David P. King","Gary, it's Dave. Just a little more color on that. I mean, first of all, there are small increases in the number of test per requisition year-over-year. So they're not a test per requisition. They're tenths of a test per requisition. And the second thing is, just to be clear, it's one of our fundamental principles that we offer physicians a wide variety of choices in how they select and order tests. So we offer them a very broad menu. They may choose to have groups of tests that they have preselected, but we offer them a very broad menu and the ability to order every test individually, other than the tests that are grouped into panels by CMS, for example. So it is -- it's physician choice that is changing the number of tests per requisition, not product choices, to use the word you used to describe it.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And one sort of pseudo-follow-up on that, just kind of thinking forward, I mean, obviously, you guys have mentioned ATOs a little bit, and those are just getting started. And some of the financial incentives for physicians are initially much more limited than you could see down the line or we have seen. For example, in California, where physicians are in capitated models. I mean, do you have enough experience, I mean, maybe in California with groups like HCP, which DaVita bought, which are on a full capitated model? And what sort of impact there is on lab utilization versus fee-for-service? I mean, all of these big integrated medical groups that have taken capitation talk about really substantial reductions in imaging and hospital in-patient utilization. And I would guess that, to a certain extent, lab testing falls into something as well, where utilization is impacted negatively. But do you have enough experience with that, just to comment on that?","David P. King","Yes. The -- normally, in that type of an environment, Gary, we're -- we would be sub-capitated to the capitated provider. So -- and then we might have and we would have carve-outs for specific types of testing that wouldn't fall within the sub-capitation, whether they're molecular testing or things that are not included in a capitated rate. So even in our capitated managed care plans and in our sub-capitation with IPAs, I don't think there's huge negative impact on utilization. Obviously, there are pricing implications of sub-capitated models, but I don't think we see huge impact on utilization. And again, I think that just goes to the point of -- I don't think that doctors are out deliberately over-ordering lab testing or even deliberately over-ordering images or -- I mean, that's not what physicians do. I think there's liability concerns for many physicians. There's patient demand for many physicians, where a patient comes in and says, \"My knee has been hurting for 3 weeks, and I want an MRI done.\" So I don't think any -- other than truly bad people, I don't think anybody sets out as a physician to overuse services. I think that there are a number of drivers in the system that lead to utilization. And again, this is -- the whole intention behind the LBS is -- it's not to tell people you can't order lab testing. It's to order -- it's to help physicians order the right test for the right patient at the time the patient needs it by the highest quality provider at the most effective cost.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. I wouldn't -- I don't disagree with that, I guess. Obviously, we've seen that since there's been financial incentive to use less services or incur less costs, that marginal test or diagnostic might fall to the wayside. But if you're sub-capitated -- I mean, if you saw a growth to that, clearly, you're not going to, I guess, be willing or able to make some of the pricing or revenue concessions you've made and I think some of your existing capitated book. I guess, that would be a fair conclusion, right?","David P. King","Yes. And by the way, I also -- I do agree with you that when -- one of the things that can change the equation is when physicians have a financial interest in the services that they're ordering. That is a negative for the system, and it's a negative for utilization, and it's a negative for the highest-quality patient care.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dane Leone of Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","I have a question on Genzyme Genetics, actually, and how the integration process is going. And maybe if you could just provide a high-level update on when you think you'd hit your ROIC hurdle rate for that deal in the future of 2013 or '14, be it. And it did seem like you know something in the press release, so I'm just wondering if there was a change in integration strategy or timeline than what had been previously stated.","William B. Hayes","Dane, this is Brad. Just want to comment, the integration is going well. When we started out this process on a multi-year -- with a multi-year integration plan, and I would say so far, we are on track. And we would expect to come out of 2013 with some improvements still in early 2014 at the levels that we started out believing that we would achieve. So nothing in our thinking has changed in terms of that time frame or that experience and -- as part of the integration.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","And just -- I know this question has been asked over and over but just on the, I guess, high level on the volume growth, I'm just trying to parse out the macro issues here. Because I mean, the comps year-over-year on the volumes have obviously been affected by some of these high-deductible health plans but should then boost it a little bit by just that national demographic shift. Yes, employment year-over-year has kind of comps out to 0, I think. Maybe it's incrementally more negative, but just what is -- I mean, why -- there's something structurally different? Or I mean, what can you do in terms of content to help drive it? You've had a number of introductions of interesting tests in oncology. Is it just really sluggishness with the routine business that's kind of overwhelming everything else or is it a temporary fact that hiccup maybe in the esoteric business that we can see a re-acceleration potentially later this year?","David P. King","Dane, it's Dave. I don't really think there's much to add. I think we've covered this topic in as much detail as we can really offer you. The macro environment is tough. Unemployment is not getting better. Managed care enrollment is not getting better. And I think we're doing a very good job in terms of executing on our company priorities and our Five Pillar Strategy. But we can't make the external environment improve for us.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just a last question, can you just give an opinion or some color on the market for acquiring hospital outreach programs or customer lists at the smaller scale, something that you don't really report? Is that environment becoming more competitive? We've heard some private equity groups getting into the roll-up game with the smaller labs. I'm just curious for your thoughts on that.","David P. King","I think the acquisition market is always competitive. I wouldn't describe it as any more competitive or less competitive today. The industry remains highly fragmented. The barriers to entry remain extremely low, and it's a very intensely competitive market for starting businesses and for acquiring them and for running them.","As we have about 5 minutes left, so we're going to try to -- if you're asking -- if you're going to ask again about the environment, maybe we can go -- not  pass over that. And if you have substantive questions, we'd be happy to address them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti of Maxim Group.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","You had talked about the weakness in histology and vitamin D. Well, I guess, vitamin D had been strong for a while, and that's dropped off. Can you talk about some of the other tests that you think will help drive genomic and esoteric testing to 45% of revenues in the next 3 to 5 years?","David P. King","Yes. We've seen really nice growth in our specialized endocrinology business, our specialized coagulation business. We have seen good performances in cardiovascular, or our chronic kidney disease program is having terrific success in terms of year-over-year growth. We're very pleased about the progress with new swab, with the age-based guidelines for sexually transmitted disease testing, which follows the -- specifically follows the ACOG recommendations so the so physician is able to select based on what ACOG tells them to do. The universal carrier screening tests, Genzyme Genetics, Integrated Genetics, the Ariosa non-invasive trisomy -- fetal trisomy test, a number of oncology markers and, of course, continued development of our next-generation sequencing platform for even broader analysis of tumors, cancers and oncology generally. So I think there are a lot of terrific things going on at LabCorp. And again, outside of this environment, I think we will see nice improvement in utilization and esoteric testing growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hima Inguva of Bank of America.","Hima B. Inguva - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'd like to know your outlook on M&A for remainder of the year. Do you expect to see smaller bolt-ons or will you be open to doing larger transactions? I have a follow-up.","David P. King","I think if -- it would depend on what larger transaction, but I think if an attractive transaction became available, of course, we would look at it. We're in the process of doing a sizable integration with Integrated Genetics, Integrated Oncology, and we have another not-insignificant integration coming up, assuming that we're able to close MEDTOX in relatively short order. So the focus will clearly be on the fold-in, bolt-on type deals for the rest of the year.","Hima B. Inguva - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And do you expect to exit debt markets this year?","David P. King","We haven't made a decision on that, but we're always looking at whether there's the opportunity to improve our overall capital structure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper of Raymond James.","Alexander  Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","My questions have been asked and answered, but just maybe a quick clarification. I think at some point, you guys had talked about either how much organic volume growth or total top line growth you need to get margin expansion, excluding any cost-saving activities. Could you just remind me what that is and tell me if it's total top line growth, indiscremental price or volume or if it needs to be dependent on volume?","William B. Hayes","Sandy, this is a Brad. I don't know that we've ever put that out there in terms of a hard-and-fast number, but I go back to the kind of the way we think about the business in that 4% to 6% top line growth range which, as Dave mentioned earlier, has some tuck-in acquisitions built into it. It creates nice leverage in our business regardless of any cost structure to grow our margins and our earnings. So I really haven't -- I don't think have a grid of, okay, at this level, it's this and at this level, it's that and we're always working on the efficiencies that Dave mentioned as part of our prepared remarks.","David P. King","Sandy, it's Dave. I mean, obviously, if you get 3% unit pricing growth, it's easy to get margin expansion. So -- but there is a lot of leverage in the volume, and so we tend to think of it as it's a -- like everything in this business, it's a combination of the impact to volume and price.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick housekeeping item. On the equity method income, you've obviously had a $2.9 million increase there that you've disclosed. But I guess the question I had is, will you have a new Canadian partner in this calendar year? Should we expect the equity method income to remain pretty consistent now that you own basically 100% of that?","William B. Hayes","Darren, this is Brad. One thing I'd like to point out too on that $2.9 million, that was excluded. That gain was excluded from our adjusted EPS. I want to make sure people appreciate that. And on the second question, we're always looking at our business structure in Canada and thinking about partners and how we own and operate that business. So it would be speculation to think about what might happen between now and the end of the year.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to David King.","David P. King","Thank you very much, Reggie. We appreciate everyone listening this morning and wish you all a good day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"12960":["Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (NYSE:LH) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call February  7, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Scott Frommer - VP, IR","David King - Chairman, CEO & President","Glenn Eisenberg - CFO & EVP","John Ratliff - CEO, Covance Drug Development","Conference Call Participants","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Jack Meehan - Barclays Bank","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Erin Wright - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs Group","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup","Daniel Leonard - Deutsche Bank","Rivka Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","Kevin Caliendo - UBS Investment Bank","Donald Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies","William Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies","Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity Limited","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the LabCorp Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Scott Frommer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Scott Frommer","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development. ","In addition to our press release, we also furnished Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to 2019 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on operating and financial results and the opportunities for future growth. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David King","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. As we enter our 50th year, we have transformed from a local laboratory operating from a hospital basement to a leading global life sciences company that is deeply integrated in guiding patient care. We are focused on our three foundational goals: delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing new medicines to patients faster and using technology to change the way care is delivered. We achieved these goals through the power of the LabCorp enterprise, combining our scale, breadth of services, integration of capabilities and data and patients' interest and need to deliver innovation, quality, efficiency and service. ","We closed out 2018 by delivering another year of strong profitable growth, driven by revenue of over $11 billion and adjusted EPS of over $11 per share, increases of 10% and 20%, respectively. We also generated free cash flow adjusted for a onetime tax payment of over $1 billion as well as over $650 million in proceeds from business divestitures. We returned $700 million of that amount to shareholders through repurchases and paid down $695 million of debt to bring us within our targeted leverage range of 2.5 to 3x EBITDA. ","Our quarter was highlighted by another strong performance in our Covance Drug Development business, which benefited from our unique data and analytics solutions, a strong sale performance and our Covance LaunchPad cost initiative. Covance reported constant-currency organic revenue growth of over 9%, margin improvement of almost 300 basis points and book-to-bill of 1.34 under ASC 606. For comparison to other CROs, our book-to-bill under the prior revenue recognition accounting standard would have been 1.46. ","Our customers consistently tell us that they value quality and speed in their trials. We continue to deliver that quality and speed through innovative solutions, capitalizing on the integration with LabCorp Diagnostics. In this regard, a recent independent sell-side survey of R&D professionals found that large pharma sponsors believe that of all major CROs, Covance's data strategy is most likely to speed patient recruitment. The same survey recognized Covance's leadership in important CRO attributes, including depth of services, quality and specific therapeutic expertise. Covance is the only CRO to combine early development, central lab and clinical services in an end-to-end offering. And the proof of our success is that we supported 93% of FDA-approved new drugs in 2018, including 94% of approved orphan drugs and 88% of approved biologics. ","In Diagnostics, the fourth quarter was burdened with a number of nonoperational items causing a 400 basis point decline in our reported operating margin of 16.5%. Excluding these nonoperational items, adjusted operating margin would have been 18.5%, which demonstrates that the underlying core business is stable and the cash flow and margin characteristics of our business remain strong. In fact, we delivered solid organic volume growth of 1.8% for the full year.","We are also off to a strong start in 2019 on multiple fronts. First, our sales force and leadership are actively engaged with providers regarding the changes in key managed care laboratory provider networks. We note that January volume related to the contract changes was consistent with our expectations. To be clear, we are making this comment because of market concern around the impact of the contract changes, and we will continue our policy of not commenting about intra-quarter performance. ","Second, referral volumes from hospitals and health systems have increased since November. We are in discussions regarding a number of attractive potential hospital partnerships. And the financial benefits and positive impact on patient care produced by our ability to integrate health systems and physicians into clinical trials helps differentiate us in competitive solutions. ","Third, although we continue to see judicial and legislative relief on the second round of PAMA price reductions, there is increasing industry-wide awareness about PAMA's true impact. This presents us with a number of attractive tuck-in lab acquisition opportunities, which typically deliver significant synergies and high return on invested capital. ","Finally, we provide additional detail on Phase II of our LaunchPad initiative in Diagnostics this morning, which will deliver $200 million of savings within 3 years. This initiative focuses on eliminating manual processes; digitizing the business; using technology to improve quality, operations and service; enhancing the consumer experience; and bringing our services closer to the customer. Phase II of LaunchPad will streamline our business, unlock new avenues for growth and contribute to improvement in our long-term margins.","For 2019, despite known headwinds facing our Diagnostics business, we expect modest growth in total company revenue and adjusted EPS. We continue to have high confidence in our business fundamentals as we expect another year of approximately $1 billion in free cash flow. Our outlook is driven by strong anticipated performance in Drug Development and capital deployment, including share repurchases and financially sound acquisitions as we continue to create long-term shareholder value. ","I'll now discuss our integrated platform, which provides us with competitive advantages in data and analytics, patient engagement, scientific innovation and therapeutic expertise that we convert into net orders, profitable growth and shareholder value creation. We have invested significantly in Covance over the last 4 years, adding exceptional talent including over 35 key executives, therapeutic expertise, global scale in the clinical business through organic growth as well as the Chiltern and Sciformix acquisitions and capacity around the world for growth in all 3 lines of business. These investments, as well as over $60 million to be invested in 2019 for global facility expansion, have put Covance on a strong growth trajectory, as reflected in our 2018 performance and our 2019 guidance. Yet just as important as the financial investment is the integration of capabilities and data streams from the 2 businesses to create a truly differentiated end-to-end offering that no competitor can replicate. ","During the quarter, the value of our combined analytics and data capabilities continued to translate into awards, supporting our strong book-to-bill and backlog of nearly $10 billion. We recently launched our data-as-a-differentiator initiative, highlighting Covance clinical development's recruitment performance. Based on an analysis of trials conducted over the last 5 years, we increased speed in patient recruitment relative to the rest of the market by almost 9 months in muscle and skeletal disorders, 5 months in neurology indications and 4 months in oncology. These findings are meaningful to patients as they deliver on our promise to bring cutting-edge medications to market faster and to biopharma sponsors as they translate into financial benefits. ","For example, a top 20 pharma customer recently awarded us a Phase III multiple sclerosis trial, a new therapeutic area in that partnership, in a competitive bid process. We utilized our combined data sets and our deep therapeutic expertise to demonstrate trial design and execution insights at the site and country level. The sponsor also highlighted patient engagement tools, recruitment and retention capabilities among its reasons for selecting Covance. ","The value of end-to-end data is also apparent in the migration of 22 projects in 2018 from early development into clinical services. Sponsors increasingly see the data generated in our early-phase development solutions as foundational to the ensuing trial and elect to stay with Covance due to our end-to-end capabilities.","During the quarter, we continued to draw critical drug-development insights from direct engagement and survey work with our diagnostics patients. This unique engagement is powered by the patients' trusted relationship with our diagnostic business. Engaging directly with potential trial candidates and incorporating the data into trial design is an area where we uniquely bring value to sponsors. ","For instance, through patient engagement, we recently demonstrated to a biotech sponsor focused on rare diseases that patients would consider halting their current treatment regimen to enroll in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. This finding helped convince top investigators to participate in the sponsor's trial. The combination of our leading Diagnostics and Drug Development businesses provides many such insights that enhance quality, speed and the likelihood of trial success. ","We are also executing unique trial virtualization strategies beyond what our competitors are able to offer. One significant challenge sponsors face in patient recruitment is reluctance to enroll in trials due to the burden of participation. Our solution increases convenience for patients and significantly lowers their travel burden by using our network of nearly 1,800 LabCorp patient service centers to perform basic safety assessment without the need for a visit to the physician's office. We conducted successful studies using approximately 60 PSCs and approximately 500 subjects, causing the sponsor to ramp up a nationwide program in 2019. This is an enterprise solution combining convenient sample collection through the PSC network, testing performed in Covance central laboratory services and scheduling services provided by our Covance market access call centers and could not be accomplished by either business alone. ","The LabCorp of the future will have more opportunities for patient-centered innovation by expanding into new channels. Our LabCorp-Walgreens partnership continues to make solid progress, with plans to open 125 locations by the end of 2019 and at least 600 locations over the next 4 years. Our collaboration goes beyond shifting patient service centers into convenient locations. It provides us with a new channel to the consumer market. Indeed, consumers have commented in real-time surveys that they chose our Walgreens PSCs because they want their blood drawn in a health care setting. The Walgreens locations allow us to become a more essential part of how the consumer thinks about health. And we intend to capitalize on the opportunity by integrating patients' prescription and laboratory data and jointly offering health-focused services through this channel, including wellness screening, medication therapy management and direct patient recruitment. ","Our integrated solutions transcend a pure-play lab or CRO offering and are increasingly part of the value proposition to a wide range of customers. Hospitals and health systems that are preparing for the transition to value-based care view access to and participation in medical research and clinical trials as an appealing business opportunity. This is the key differentiator, and we continue to progress with our preferred site partnership strategy, significantly exceeding our goal for master service agreements, driving improved patient recruitment from our partner sites and helping them increase the speed of study start-up activities. ","Providers, biopharma sponsors and payers also value our scientific innovation. Our companion diagnostics offering had another outstanding year in 2018, delivering $200 million of enterprise revenue and over $300 million in drug development orders, plus the benefit of market leadership for Diagnostics by commercializing the gold standard companion diagnostic test. ","As we enter our 50th year, we have built an integrated life sciences company supported by two storied businesses. We see great opportunities for our powerful combination in the years ahead. We are excited with the immediate growth opportunities in Covance, the renewed growth in Diagnostics after the impact of the managed care contract changes, the power of our combination in increasing consumer engagement, generating insights for customers from consumer data and survey work, the value add of LabCorp capabilities to Covance sponsors and Covance trial opportunities for LabCorp customers and the tremendous growth opportunity ahead as we increasingly globalize both businesses. ","We deliver a unique value proposition to customers and shareholders. And the continued power of our integrated offerings positions us to grow and thrive in the rapidly evolving health care environment. Although we face several unusual challenges in 2019, the strength and breadth of our platform provides stability and a positive outlook. We remain committed to driving growth in 2020 and beyond, to maximizing long-term value creation and to continuing to enable our 60,000 colleagues around the world to do what they do best: deliver on our patient-centric mission to improve health and improve lives.","Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2019 guidance. As a reminder, on January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, meaning that we restated our 2017 financial results to better enable evaluation of our 2018 performance. In the press release, our prepared remarks and the Q&A session that follow, all references to our 2017 results are to the restated numbers unless we specifically note otherwise. ","Revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, an increase of 1.6% over last year, with organic growth of 2.9% and acquisitions contributing 0.7%. This was partially offset by divestitures of 1.6% and unfavorable foreign currency translation of 40 basis points. Operating income for the quarter was $308 million or 11% of revenue compared to $331 million or 12% last year. During the quarter, we had $31 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to LaunchPad initiatives and acquisition integration. Adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization of $56 million as well as restructuring charges and special items, was $395 million or 14.2% of revenue compared to $433 million or 15.8% last year. The $38 million reduction in adjusted operating income and 160 basis point decline in margin were primarily due to lower pricing as a result of the implementation of PAMA, divestitures and higher personnel costs, partially offset by increased demand, mix, LaunchPad savings and acquisitions. ","The tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%. During the quarter, we reported $8 million in deferred income taxes due to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition integration of Chiltern. Excluding onetime tax reform-related adjustments, other special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate was 24.7% in the quarter, down from 34.5% last year. This lower tax rate was primarily due to the benefit from tax reform in the U.S. We expect the company's adjusted tax rate for the full year 2019 to be between 25% and 26% compared to 24.3% for the full year 2018, with the increase primarily due to state tax reform and the projected mix of earnings. ","Net earnings for the quarter were $158 million or $1.56 per diluted share. Net earnings were reduced by $22 million or $0.21 per diluted share due to a loss on the divestiture of our U.S. forensics lab testing business, a noncash settlement charge on one of our pension plans and a write-off on an investment in our venture fund. Adjusted EPS, which exclude these losses, amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $2.52 in the quarter, up 11% over last year. Adjusted earnings in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $0.04 per diluted share due to lower volume caused by unfavorable weather. ","Operating cash flow was $486 million in the quarter, which included the net tax payment of approximately $105 million related to divestitures. Excluding this onetime tax payment, operating cash flow would have been $591 million compared to $565 million a year ago. This $26 million increase was due to higher cash earnings, partially offset by increased working capital to support top line growth. ","Capital expenditures totaled $122 million or 4.4% of revenue compared to $96 million or 3.5% last year. As a result, in the quarter, free cash flow was $364 million or $469 million excluding the onetime tax payment compared to $469 million last year. ","We remained active throughout the quarter in terms of capital allocation. At quarter end, our cash balance was $427 million, down from $893 million at the end of the third quarter. Utilizing free cash flow during the quarter and excess cash, we repurchased $400 million of stock, paid down $400 million of debt and invested $39 million in acquisitions. On February 6, the board replaced the company's existing share repurchase plan with a new plan authorizing repurchase of up to $1.25 billion of stock, demonstrating our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. ","Total debt at quarter end was $6.1 billion, and our leverage was 3x gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA, which is at the upper end of our 2.5 to 3x leverage target. As we committed at the time we acquired Covance in 2015, we would delever back to our targeted leverage ratio, which we had accomplished while still repurchasing over $1 billion of our shares during this time frame. Given the strength of our balance sheet as well as no mandatory debt maturing in 2019, we expect to use all of our free cash flow this year for share repurchases and acquisitions.","Throughout the year, we remain focused on portfolio optimization via the divestiture of noncore assets. Transactions included the sale of our Food Solutions business for $655 million and 2 small forensic testing businesses. ","Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. During the quarter, our Diagnostics business was negatively impacted by several nonoperational items. These items include divestitures, implementation of PAMA, adverse weather, the year-over-year impact from the calendar due to fewer revenue days and 1 extra payroll day and foreign currency translation. I'll refer to these collectively as nonoperational items. ","Now I'll discuss our Diagnostics operating performance as well as the impact of the nonoperational items, which better portrays the underlying strength of our business. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 2.8% to last year. This volume was due to the negative impact from divestitures of 2.6% and foreign currency translation of approximately 0.2%. Organic revenue on a constant currency basis was negative 0.4%, which was offset by the benefit from acquisitions of 0.4%. ","During the quarter, the negative impacts from PAMA was 100 basis points, the calendar was 80 basis points, and adverse weather was 40 basis points. Excluding the nonoperational items, organic revenue for the quarter increased by approximately 1.8%. ","Revenue per requisition excluding the impact from divestitures decreased by 40 basis points, driven by the impact from PAMA of 100 basis points, partially offset by test mix. Excluding the impact from divestitures, total volume increased 30 basis points as acquisition volume contributed 40 basis points and organic volume declined by 10 basis points. Excluding the nonoperational items, organic volume increased by approximately 1.1%. ","LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $279 million or 16.5% of revenue compared to $357 million or 20.5% last year. The decline in operating income and margin was primarily due to the impact from PAMA of approximately $18 million or 80 basis points, the year-on-year impact from the calendar of approximately $20 million or 100 basis points, adverse weather, divestitures and higher personnel costs, partially offset by acquisitions and cost reductions. Excluding the nonoperational items, adjusted operating income and margin were approximately $329 million and 18.5%, respectively. ","As Dave noted, we expect the LaunchPad II initiative to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings over the next 3 years while incurring approximately $40 million in onetime implementation costs. We expect roughly 1\/3 of the total savings to be realized in each year.","Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 9.6% over last year due to organic growth of 9.3% and acquisitions of 1.2%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 90 basis points. ","Adjusted operating income for the segment was $154 million or 14% of revenue compared to $111 million or 11.1% last year. The $43 million increase in operating income and 290 basis point improvement in margins were primarily due to organic demand, LaunchPad savings and acquisitions, partially offset by higher personnel costs. ","We remain on track to deliver $150 million in net savings from Covance's 3-year LaunchPad initiative by the end of 2020 and $30 million of cost synergies from the integration of Chiltern by the end of 2019. ","Net orders during the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 14% from last year, contributing to a net book-to-bill for the quarter of 1.34. For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remain strong at $5.4 billion and 1.26, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $9.8 billion, an increase of approximately $360 million from last quarter. We expect approximately $3.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","Now I'll discuss our 2019 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, for the entire year and the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow being used for share repurchases and acquisitions. We expect revenue growth of 0.5% to 2.5% over 2018 revenue of $11.3 billion, which includes the negative impacts of 1% from divestiture and 0.4% from currency translation. We expect the change in LabCorp Diagnostics revenue of negative 4% to negative 2% as compared to 2018 revenue of $7 billion, inclusive of foreign currency translation of approximately negative 30 basis points. This guidance includes the negative impact of approximately 2% from divestitures in 2018. Excluding divestitures, the change in revenue in LabCorp Diagnostics is expected to be down 2% to flat, primarily due to the impact from PAMA. We have assumed that PAMA will reduce our Diagnostics revenue by approximately 1.6% in 2019 consisting of lower direct Medicare reimbursement of approximately $85 million and the indirect impact on other reimbursement, primarily Medicaid-related plans of approximately $30 million.","In addition, we expect organic volume to be flat to slightly down year-over-year due to the onetime impact from changes in certain managed care contracts and networks. Independent of divestitures, PAMA and managed care dynamics, we expect another year of good organic volume growth, favorable mix and contributions from acquisitions. ","We expect Covance Drug Development revenue growth of 5% to 9% over 2018 revenue of $4.3 billion, which includes the negative impact of approximately 60 basis points of currency translation. We expect Covance's first quarter revenue growth rate to be below its full year guidance range, primarily due to timing and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.","Our adjusted EPS guidance is $11 to $11.40, a change of 0% to 3% compared to $11.02 in 2018. We expect modest growth in adjusted EPS to be driven by Covance, LaunchPad across the enterprise and capital deployment, partially offset by our Diagnostics business due to the impact from PAMA and changes in managed care contracts. Our guidance assumes that the all-in impact from PAMA reduces EPS by approximately $0.85 per diluted share. In addition, our guidance reflects the year-on-year increase in cybersecurity expenditures of approximately $25 million or $0.18 per diluted share. ","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we expect adjusted EPS in the first quarter of 2019 to be comparable to adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter of 2018. This implies a lower percentage of total year adjusted EPS in the first quarter than we have reported in prior years, primarily due to the timing of Covance revenue growth, the ramp-up of LaunchPad savings during the year, the impact from acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact from the calendar.","Our free cash flow guidance is $950 million to $1.05 billion compared to $926 million last year. In 2019, we expect capital expenditures of approximately 4% of revenue, driven by investments in facilities, technology and automation to support growth. ","Now before we take questions, I'd like to announce a transition in Investor Relations. Scott Frommer has done an outstanding job leading our Investor Relations efforts over the past several years. Scott will now be taking on a financial leadership role within our Diagnostics business. I am pleased to announce that Clarissa Willett will now take over the leadership of Investor Relations. Clarissa has been in the financial leadership role in our Diagnostics business and has over 21 years of health care experience. Prior to joining LabCorp, Clarissa was the CFO of PAML, which we acquired in 2017.","This concludes our formal remarks, and now we will take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Congrats, Scott. So I guess maybe starting on Covance. I mean, obviously, a fantastic quarter across the board. Dave, thanks for the color. I guess as you think about the RFP environment and just sort of new business and how that's trending, given some of the biotech volatility, how are you thinking about sort of the overall landscape as you enter into 2019? And then from a share perspective and to the point you made, Dave, in terms of your IT efforts starting to resonate in terms of patient recruitment, et cetera, do you feel like on the booking side, we'll see even more evidence over the balance of '19 of sort of some share gains potentially at late-phase part of the business?","John Ratliff","This is John. I think the RFP business is strong across the board, whether that's in early development, whether that's in the labs and whether that's in the late stage. So if you look at the pipelines, seeing strength, the biotech side as well as even on pharma side. And I do believe that the data side, the solutions side of LabCorp Covance is leading to gains in bookings and allowing us to win. Very proud of the 1.34 book-to-bill on the fourth quarter on a 606 basis and the 1.46 on the 605 kind of compared to the other CROs and how they report. So I do think that that's helping us win at the end of the day and, as Dave stated, helps on the entire site selection piece and solution side of our business.","Ross Muken","That's helpful. And maybe just quickly, from a capital allocation perspective, obviously, you took up the buyback. You still have some ammunition if you wanted to do obviously M&A on either side of the business. I guess given sort of where the stock got to and valuation in general on your equity, I guess how are you thinking about sort of the trade-off of what your own sort of yield provides and return versus kind of what you're seeing maybe on the M&A side of things?","David King","Yes. Ross, it's Dave. So we've been very disciplined acquirers, and we will continue to be disciplined acquirers. We look at every potential acquisition based on our strategic criteria and our financial criteria. We did a couple of tuck-in lab deals last year, and we did the Sciformix deal, which was a very important complement to the Covance market access business. So we're going to continue to look at attractive opportunities but, again, in a disciplined way and recognizing that, in our view, with the stock undervalued, that we get a very high return from deploying capital toward share repurchase.","Operator","Our next question is from Jack Meehan from Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Dave, I was hoping you could provide an update on what you're seeing in terms of hospital referral trends. That was the one variable we had the least visibility on when you were guiding in November. So has that improved at all? And do you have any new visibility into what market dynamics were going on?","David King","So a couple of things on the hospital referrals. We did see, as we stated when we revised the guidance, a falloff in the beginning part of 4Q. I'm pleased to report that we saw improvement in December, and for the quarter, the referral business stabilized and started to grow again. And built into our guidance is that, that business is going to be consistent through the year. I'd also just like to highlight, for a variety of, I think, market dynamics, health systems are increasingly looking at ways to partner. And we have a number of ongoing and, I think, interesting partnership discussions that we hope will ultimately turn out to be productive. Again, the combination of LabCorp's capabilities, breadth of test menu and quality of service, with the Covance piece of trial recruitment, trial enrollment and the site partnership strategy, really is an attractive differentiator when we speak to these health systems.","Jack Meehan","Great. Looking forward to those updates. And then, Glenn, just one on the PAMA commentary for 2019. So the 39 related to other contracts, what's the assumption there? Is it basically that -- do you think all Medicaid fee schedules follow the Medicare fee schedule? What's going on in terms of floating-rate contracts? Just any commentary on why the PAMA impact will -- figure would be helpful.","David King","Yes. Jack, it's Dave again. So as we've said all along, the market survey that was done to support the PAMA cuts was fundamentally flawed. And so the rate reductions that were imposed on us by -- for fee-for-service Medicare were far in excess of what would have been required to bring the payment rates to market. The knock-on effect of that, which is the approximately $2 million that we called out -- that Glenn called out in his prepared comments is basically Medicaid plans, both fee-for-service and managed Medicaid, reducing their rates consistent with the Medicare reductions. This was not anticipated as part of the PAMA statute. It was not contained within the statutory language, which specifically applied to Medicare. But it has exacerbated the impact of PAMA obviously both this year, that is '18, and next year, '19. And so the straight Medicare fee-for-service cut is about the 10% that we had projected. And Glenn gave you that number in the prepared comments. But the knock-on effect is almost entirely the Medicaid plans following suit in terms of administratively reducing rates. These are not negotiated rate decreases.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Caliendo from UBS.","Kevin Caliendo","Would love to get a little bit of an update on pricing outside of Medicaid and PAMA and if you've seen any impact or you expect to see any impact in 2019 from the PAMA cuts if there's any contagion into your other managed care pricing and the like.","David King","It's Dave. I don't believe that the PAMA cuts directly other than the $30 million that I just mentioned related to the Medicaid plans have bled over into the managed care negotiations. Most of the managed care payers begin a contract negotiation by asking for reductions. But to my knowledge and speaking with the team, there's no -- none of this is referenced, because of PAMA, X should happen. And we've been pleased with the pricing on the managed care renewals. We did just conclude the renewal of the Humana contract, the extension and renewal of the Humana contract. So basically, all of the big contracts are off the table for the foreseeable future. And we're pleased about having some certainty in how managed care is going to shape up over the next couple of years.","Kevin Caliendo","One follow-up, well, not on the pricing but on Covance, the margin increase was pretty material, much higher than we had expected. Is there anything in that margin number that we should expect would not be recurring? Is this sort of the run rate? Is there anything in that as we sort of think about Covance going forward?","John Ratliff","Well, you always see, as Glenn stated, a bit of seasonality fourth to first, as well as you'll have on the revenue side the foreign currency headwind against you. But in terms of the strength of fourth quarter, it was built on the LaunchPad actions, it was built on strong backlog, it was built on organic growth. We will see margin increases where projected, see margin increases in terms of full year 2019, and you'll see year-on-year improvement. But you will see 14% sequentially pull down for those reasons as well as just where the revenue feathers in based on where the backlog plays out in the mix of the businesses.","Operator","Our next question is from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","First, Scott, I've really enjoyed working with you, and I wish you the best in your new role. Second, the comment around organic growth outside of the shift and the managed care changes. Dave, can you just give us a little color as to what you're seeing? Is that going back to your earlier comments around health system partnerships? Is it expectations around utilization? If you can just give us a little more color as to what your expectations are on that organic side, would be my first question.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. Lisa, this is Glenn. I'll start, and Dave may provide some color. When you look at the guidance that we've given, we did talk about organic volume for '19 to be flat to slightly down. But as you commented on, the rationale for that is that the impact of the managed care contracts was going to be a net negative on organic volume. And if you think about, historically, we've been roughly a 1% to 2% kind of organic volume growth, and we really don't see that changing with the expectation of -- or with the exception of the -- just with the changes from the managed care side.","David King","Yes. Lisa, it's Dave. I would say, obviously, we've said this many times, when you look at the size of United compared to the size of Aetna, we're going to end up from a volume perspective on the negative side of the equation. And obviously, putting Horizon into that and some projected losses in Horizon make that even more apparent. However, as Glenn said, our business grows rough. And it grows because of the demographics. It grows because of the aging population. It grows because of new tests coming to market. It grows because of share shifts and share gains within the market. And so we feel very confident that there will be organic growth next year as there was this year, 1.8% for the full year of '18. We feel confident there will be organic growth in '19. It will just be muted by the net impact of the managed care shifts.","Lisa Gill","And then just as a follow-up. You gave an update on Walgreens. I think you said 125 stores, still with the goal of 600 stores over 4 years. Dave, any incremental color you can give us as to how those 125 stores have performed versus, one, your expectation? And two, are you seeing volumes kind of consistent with patient service centers? Are you seeing better volumes? Just any color around that would be helpful.","David King","Yes. Just to be clear, the 125 will be by the end of the -- of '19. But what I can say on -- we opened a number of new patient service centers in California inside Walgreens. We track the daily and weekly volumes. They have been consistent and growing, and the Net Promoter Scores and customer satisfaction rates -- we take immediate real-time surveys from patients either from the kiosk or through their mobile devices, have been very favorable. So in terms of volumes from other patient service centers, when we actually relocate a patient service center into a Walgreens, what we typically see is quite comparable volume. When we add -- or even better volume. When we add a Walgreens to complement an existing patient service center, we, of course, would typically see lower volumes at the beginning.","Operator","Our next question is from Erin Wright from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Erin Wright","Across the Covance business, could you comment on the traction you're seeing in the types of trials, whether it be FSP or full service and the mix of large pharma versus some of the biotech customers and where sort of the data offering resonating better and how should we think about backlog conversion trends as well as the profit profile thereon?","John Ratliff","This is John. It is still a mix of the FSP versus programmatic. There are companies that have embraced the FSP. I think we're stronger now in our capabilities there based on the Chiltern acquisition and adding into our monitoring FSP strength, the biometric FSP strength. But that mix of programmatic and FSP hasn't swung. I think that our capabilities have gotten much better in regard to that. In terms of the biotech versus large pharma, obviously, if you look out there in terms of research, the majority of the molecule developments in the biotech, it was a healthy environment in terms of VC side and funding side. And in terms of strength of the pipeline, the strength is in both sides in terms of the biotech and the large pharma. And there's been no increase in cancellations across that. Right now, you have to say the RFP volume is pretty robust in that area. And then as to the data as the differentiator and that for patient recruitment and site selection, that plays into the total solution for the company. It's also -- as I've said on these calls, it is data. It is about strategy protocol optimization. That is also on the team that you put in front. Those are all equal weightings. I would say that data as a differentiator resonates in both environments, whether that's on the large or the mid-tier small. And so there really is no delineation there between the two. It's pronounced in all areas as well as what Dave talked about. Showing the data, reducing time lines in the actual trials is across all the therapeutic areas, and demonstration of that is in biotechs as well as large.","Erin Wright","Great, that's really helpful. And then switching to the managed care contracts. Has there been any sort of surprises in the early days with the -- how that business is rolling out as well as the offsets of other contract shifts? And anecdotally, how should we think about the quarterly progression of those contract changes over the course of 2019?","David King","It's Dave. There have not been any surprises in the way that it's rolled out. As I said throughout the fourth quarter, our expectation was there would be -- the losses would be relatively early. And as I commented -- and again, I want to make clear, we commented only because of heightened market concern about the contract changes, and we're not going to start a policy of commenting about performance within the quarter. But with that caveat, as I commented, January volumes were basically -- for those contracts were basically riding expectations. So we're pleased actually with our performance in January with respect to those contracts as well as with our -- the accuracy to this point of our estimates.","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly","Appreciate the color on the Covance margins. Maybe just on the other side, the LCD margins. Given the pricing dynamics, the managed care shift away from you guys, can you just talk through kind of the go-forward perspective there? What causing the shifts you could be most aggressive on? Just trying to think through the levers in 2019 as the offset on the margins.","David King","Yes. Patrick, it's Dave. So one thing that I think -- I mean, we've talked about LaunchPad. That will certainly be part of the 2019 plan. And that will involve some substantial cost reductions. Just looking at $200 million over 3 years, obviously, the math is pretty straightforward. I just would like to comment separately from that. We did in the fourth quarter, as we talked about when we revised the guidance, have the experience of having staffed up pretty heavily for what we expected to be a very strong seasonal trend in the consumer genetics business, which, as we said, did not materialize. And so we started taking those cost reduction actions in the fourth quarter. But by the time we were fully aware of the trend, it was late enough in the quarter that you can actually see the impact of most of those actions in the first quarter of '19. So there are a variety of levers, from personnel to facilities to all the things I've talked about in the prepared comments on LaunchPad, that I think will affect margin performance in '19. Having said that, as we have repeatedly said, we do expect Diagnostics margins to be down in 2019 because of the combination of PAMA and the managed care changes, but we do not expect them to be down as much as they were down in 2018. So we expect the margin performance to be better in 2019 in terms of the relative decline.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. The only thing to -- Patrick, I'd add to that is just there were also some unusual items that negatively impacted the Diagnostics margin year-on-year in '18 versus '17 that we've talked about earlier, from the business disruption that we had, the unfavorable weather obviously that we would not forecast for the business in the future, the fact that we had an extra payroll day and also the impact of the divestitures of our forensics business. All 4 of those that were, call it, a negative impact on margins within Diagnostics in 2018 will not be in 2019. So again, to Dave's point, we'll still see the margins decline because of the incremental impact of PAMA and the managed care but offset by LaunchPad, offset by not having these recurring items as well as we do believe favorable mix and the potential for tuck-in acquisitions as well.","Patrick Donnelly","That's helpful. Appreciate it. And then you touched on the consumer genetics business. 23andMe had been a nice growth driver for this quarter. The other kind of biggest genetics player called out a shortfall in consumer genetics testing in general this quarter as well, so it seems to be kind of that industry slowing down a bit. Can you just help us think about the go-forward view there, what type of growth you're baking in, what the potential surprise could be on the upside?","David King","Yes. Obviously, what we have to go on is projections we receive from our customers, but our plan contemplates 23andMe basically being relatively flat year-on-year. So the potential is that they do better, but we feel comfortable with what we've mapped into the -- into our budget.","Operator","Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Citigroup.","Ralph Giacobbe","The GAO's out with a report on sort of a PAMA loophole, if you will, and kind of like Grassley recently sent out a letter around that as well. Dave, I was hoping maybe to just get your take on it in terms of -- I know the overpayment numbers seem pretty outsized versus likely reality. But just wanted to get your take first, I guess, just operationally, whether you think that has and is being sort of influencing the hospital outreach and the physician office labs in terms of what they're doing from a business perspective and maybe even pushing out sales process in terms of tuck-in M&A and then if you expect that to change in 2019 and then some of the other characteristics of that report that Grassley sort of latched on to.","David King","Yes. Thanks, Ralph. So I would start by saying that report was really quite unfortunately erroneous on multiple dimensions. So what -- if we go back to pre-PAMA, CMS -- there are automated chemistry panels that are defined by CMS that have a certain number of chemistry components. Let's just make up that you order an automated chemistry panel that has 8 components, and it bundles to a particular CPT code and price. Pre the change for PAMA, if you were 6 chemistries or 7 chemistries, that is short of the total in the panel, CMS would use bundling logic to bundle those together and pay you with the panel rate. So you actually were paid less for 6 chemistries than you would have been paid initially. That was a CMS -- that was CMS bundling logic. When PAMA was passed and went to market-based reimbursement, the market did not use that sort of bundling logic. And so what happened is PAMA -- sorry, CMS no longer bundled those panels because that is what the market does, and PAMA was supposed to be a market rate of payment. So there is no loophole.","There is no labs doing anything nefarious. This is exactly what the statute told CMS to do. And the labs, and we submitted data to Sen. Grassley's office -- ACLA did, demonstrating that the labs are continuing to follow the bundling rules exactly as the bundling rules are laid out, which is that if all the components of a panel are ordered, you bundle and you build under that bundle. Furthermore, CMS has back-end logic that says if 8 chemistry tests are ordered, it bundles into the 8-chemistry test panel. So it's a little bit of a mystery to me how this has even become an issue, much less with these, as you mentioned, grossly exaggerated overpayment numbers. In fact, I think the GAO report had a potential overpayment number bigger than the entire Medicare lab spend. So this is just a -- this is a very unfortunate misunderstanding, which ACLA and the industry are educating both Congress and the GAO on. Unfortunately, it's created a distraction about the outsized and excessive impact of the PAMA cuts, which we talked about earlier, both from a Medicare perspective and now with the follow-on Medicaid. So I hope that's helpful, Ralph, and I apologize it was a little long, but I do think it's important that this be well understood as this is what the PAMA statute called for, and it's the implementation of the market-based payment rules.","Ralph Giacobbe","Yes, no, I appreciate that. And if I could squeeze one more in, you've talked a lot about sort of the partnership discussions on the managed care side and mentioned it earlier in the call as well. I was just hoping you can perhaps flesh those out a little bit more and, maybe more importantly, just timing now as we start thinking about 2019 and whether that has an influence or could have an influence on the business and volume more near term as opposed to 2020 and beyond.","David King","Yes. I think a lot of the partnership discussions, as we've talked about, are focusing on benefit design, participants in the network, value-based payment rates. And so particularly, things like benefit design and how the network benefits and minimizing the use of out-of-network utilization, there are changes that need to be made by the payers and by ASO employers in benefit design. So I think those changes are going to start to be made in 2019 for the 2020 selling season, but I think you'll start to see the impact really next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank.","Daniel Leonard","So just a quick clarification on the knock-on or indirect impact of PAMA. Is it fair for modeling purposes to assume that these indirect impacts persist beyond 2019 into 2020 and whatever residual might exist beyond that?","David King","Dan, it's Dave. I would say yes.","Daniel Leonard","Okay. And then my follow-up. Looking back on the fourth quarter, Dave, appreciate that you mentioned that the referral volume from hospitals and health systems recovered in December. Thinking back on it, do you have any sense for why that dipped below plan early in the quarter? And was there anything happening in the industry that you needed to tactically respond to, which drove the improvement in December?","David King","So in speaking to customers, really, the big drivers were lower admission rates and delayed flu season. I mean, those -- at least as far as we were able to tell from speaking with the customers, they were seeing similar -- yes, they were seeing similar trends in admission rate and calendar rate, bed rate, and we did have a delay in flu. So I wish I had a lot more color on it, but that was the high-level takeaway from our customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Rivka Goldwasser","So one question on managed care. Obviously, in 2018, we've seen a number of contracts opening up. Dave, in the prepared remarks, you said that Humana renewed, and all big contracts are off the table. But at this point, do you see any additional opportunities for managed care contracts that previously were exclusive to open up?","David King","Well, I think it's pretty well known that the major remaining exclusive is the Florida Blue contract that we are not a participant in. And we have been engaged in conversations with Florida Blue on a number of fronts. We have Walgreens-located patient service centers in the Florida market. So we're hopeful that we're going to see some progress there, but I can't give you a firm prediction about how it's going to turn out. We've been pleased with the fact that they've been willing to engage with us because we've been out of that contract for a good number of years.","Rivka Goldwasser","Okay. And then going back to the impact and the timing for managed care contracts, Glenn, you gave a lot of different data points. They're very helpful in trying to kind of like get to organic growth. But from what I've heard, is it fair to assume that the changes in share in a managed care contract could be kind of like a net 160 basis points kind of like headwind this year?","Glenn Eisenberg","It's the one area obviously we didn't provide a quantitative number to, just given the newness of it. And obviously, we're dealing with these kind of operational issues for the company. The way we try to get you, at least directionally there, and I think that -- the number you're saying is directionally there, but -- was that our organic volume would be flat. And given that historically we've been a 1% to 2% kind of organic volume growth business, it's fair to assume that that's the reason why we're flat instead of that other level. So we've kind of given you at least a band, which your number clearly falls well within. So it's a reasonable way of thinking about it.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich","So Dave, the call has been going on a long time. Just a quick question on the free cash flow in Q4. Looks like accounts payable was a $123 million source of cash. Glenn, just wondering if there was anything unusual there. Is that just in reverse? And that's one. And then I also wanted to clarify, you stated all of your free cash flow in 2019 is going to be used on share repurchases and M&A. Is that correct?","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes, Kevin. Yes, first, on the fourth quarter free cash flow payables, as you did see, was a source. Obviously, it's timing related. Fourth quarter, we tend to see the payable number to be a source. But I would just say more broadly, we really feel good about the progress that we've made overall on working capital management. We continue to manage cash tightly. We continue to see and saw in 2018 a continued improvement in our DSOs as well as a continued expectation when we look to the expectations for 2019, continued progress there. So overall, positive on the working capital front. With regard to the outlook for free cash flow next year, the $1 billion, we commented that the balance sheet now is within our targeted leverage, albeit at the upper end. We do expect that we will use all of our free cash flow between share repurchases as well as acquisitions, so that -- obviously, it's implying that we'll stay towards the upper end of our guidance range. But the benefit, as we have no maturing debt, we can continue to take advantage of the share repurchase program, especially where the shares are valued, and as well as have the financial flexibility to look at M&A where that makes sense.","David King","And Kevin, it's Dave. I just want to stress, financially disciplined acquisitions. So no, we're not just going to go spend money on acquisitions that don't make sense strategically and financially. And I'd also like to comment, thank you for giving the warning, so it's 5 after 10. We do have 5 questions in the queue, so we'd like to get to all of them. Let's try if we can to make the questions short and limit the follow-ups, particularly if your questions have already been answered.","Operator","Our next question is from Donald Hooker from KeyBanc.","Donald Hooker","So a quick follow-up question. In terms of the Covance growth of 9% in the quarter, looks really strong. I think the last quarter, you called out the early development preclinical side as being a big driver. Did that continue this quarter? Maybe can you parse out the different parts of Covance, how that reflects and revolves around that 9% segment growth?","John Ratliff","Yes. We saw strength in the second half in terms of both on the early development and the late stage and, in the first half, on the labs in terms of the revenues and strength across the board on all the bookings. We don't give out the individual segments in terms of the quantification, but in terms of, yes, continued strength in the ED areas as well as even on the late-stage clinical on the growth within the 9%.","Operator","Our next question is from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik De Bruin","So we've seen really good backlog numbers and books-to-bill across most of the CROs, but Covance is one of the few that you've actually seen organic revenue growth accelerating. Could you quantify your level of backlog conversion, the sort of the trends there and what you're doing to speed that up? I guess basically just the question is, are you north of 10% in your backlog conversion?","John Ratliff","In terms of the -- and I'll try to do this in a little bit different quantification of the backlog itself. Highly dependent on the type of therapeutic area you're in, we are almost approximately 50% in terms of oncology, and rare and orphan has a little different draw out in terms of the way that revenue conversion has. It's a volatile measure that seems to have stabilized. Glenn actually stated that about 40% of our aggregate backlog should convert. That's been pretty consistent in terms of the last four quarters. And then as we enter into 2019, about 85% of our revenue estimates are covered by that backlog. So hopefully, that's helpful there.","Derik De Bruin","Great. And just one quick follow-up on you've been a partner with Lilly for a long time. And obviously, they've got the Loxo deal going on, and this can cancel some trials. So if there's anything that we should be concerned about in terms of changes in that relationship just given everything going on there.","John Ratliff","No, won't see ending partnership and continued very good relationships, and contracts come up in normal course and no issues presently in the relationship.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut","John, just a follow-up in the CRO question. So are you seeing any change in pricing structures in the industry? Meaning, are you seeing competitors taking more risk around project milestones or time lines?","John Ratliff","No. That's been the way for the last few years on the risk side. And as to pricing in general, it's a competitive marketplace in terms of the late-stage and in terms of the labs, but -- from the standpoint of pretty stable in the early development side. And in terms of aggregate risk-based pricing, that's been a feature of what we've been doing for a while based on milestones, et cetera.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray.","William Quirk","So Dave, appreciate that you're not seeing PAMA rates bleed into your managed care discussions. But it does appear that some of the smaller providers, particularly hospitals, are seeing some pressure for managed care related to PAMA. So when we think about that and then also just balancing that against the expanded data collection with more hospitals included this time around, how are you thinking or how should we be thinking rather about PAMA kind of 2020 and beyond?","David King","So obviously, the expanded data collection is not the solution to the flaws of PAMA, but at least it is an improvement, and then we'll see more commercial hospital rates in the database. And we appreciate CMS being willing to take that step, although as we've said all along, legislative or regulatory or judicial relief is required to right the wrong that's occurred here. I think in terms of what's going to happen, there's another data collection that's supposed to be beginning relatively soon for the next 3-year period. And good news is most of the impact of the reductions will have occurred in the '18, '19, '20 cycle. And so at the same time, there's another reduction coming in 2020, and it will have a similar -- an impact of similar size this year. And that's going to increasingly, I think, cause others in the industry to look at partnering or other ways in which they can optimize the cost side of their business because the revenue side, particularly for those that are more dependent on Medicare, now Medicaid payment, is going to be under pressure. So I think there will be opportunities for us. And as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, some of those with health systems have accelerated last year. As you observed, it was a pretty light year for deal flow in terms of what we thought were attractive deals, but there's every reason to think that particularly, the smaller deals, there'll be more of them in 2019 than one would think in 2020.","William Quirk","Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on the consumer genetics business. You're -- I appreciate that you're modeling this flat for '19. If we see this outperform those expectations, can you just remind us of the margin flow-through here? I seem to recall it's slightly lower than corporate average, but can you cue from that?","David King","No, Bill. The pricing is lower than corporate average, but the margin is comfortably within the -- our corporate expectations.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Massaro from Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Massaro","Dave, as it relates to M&A, obviously, a lot of hospital executives don't seem to be all that familiar with PAMA. But do you get the sense that, that awareness is increasing? And if so, do you see the potential to do more deals first or second half of 2019 as it relates to hospital outreach?","David King","Yes. Mark, I think consistent with what I said in response to Bill's question, I do think the awareness of PAMA is higher, and we indicated that in the prepared remarks as well. And I do think it will, in all likelihood, lead to a more robust deal flow in '19 and '20.","Mark Massaro","Great. And I know that you are a leader in women's health testing. Can you maybe talk about what you're doing to try to encourage the adoption of average-risk NIPT?","David King","Yes. Obviously, the noncoverage of NIPT by a couple of major players is quite frustrating, particularly because the recent scientific and clinical evidence indicates that actually, a fairly high percentage of women of so-called average maternal risk nonetheless have microdeletions or other things that would be concerning in terms of the genetic impact on their fetuses, as well as recent papers indicating that there's actually a higher-than-previously reported prevalence of Down syndrome in so-called average-risk pregnancy. So we are working with ACLA, we're working with our coalition of providers that offer noninvasive prenatal testing. And we're working with women members of Congress to try to influence the coverage decisions by the major plans and, of course, the ACOG and ACMG and the thought leader groups as well. And I think the -- certainly, among the thought leaders, the tide is turning in support of prenatal screening for the average-risk population. And it's our hope that, that will persuade the payers that this is indeed a better approach and also a more cost-effective approach to prenatal screening.","Operator","At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Dave King for closing remarks.","David King","Thank you very much. Thank you all for listening this morning.

My name is Keisha and I'll be year coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David P. King, Chairman and CEO of LabCorp. Please proceed.","David P. King","Thank you, Keisha. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today from LabCorp are Brad Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Steve Anderson, Vice President, Investor Relations. This morning we will discuss our first quarter 2012 financial results, reaffirm our 2012 guidance, highlight our progress on our Five Pillar Strategy and provide answers to several frequently asked questions. ","I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Anderson, who has a few comments before we begin.","Stephen Anderson","Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via the telephone and Internet. Please refer to today's press release for replay information. This morning, the company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information.","Additionally, we refer you to today's press release, which is available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS, adjusted EPS excluding amortization, free cash flow and adjusted operating income. I would also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call. ","These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from the Genzyme Genetics and other acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the company's financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2011 10-K and subsequent filings. The company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change. ","Now Brad Hayes will review our financial results.","William B. Hayes","Thank you, Steve. On today's call, I will review 4 key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. I'll also review our 2012 guidance. ","First, cash flow. Our cash flow remain strong. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2012, was $686.9 million. We remain pleased with our cash collections. DSO was 48 days at the end of March, an increase of 1 day year-over-year and 2 days sequentially. During the quarter, we reduced our bad debt rate to 4.4%. ","Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 4% year-over-year in the first quarter. During the quarter, revenue per requisition increased 1.2% year-over-year. Total company volume increased 2.8% year-over-year during the first quarter.  Esoteric volume increased 4.8% in the quarter. The quarter benefited from an easier weather comp, which increased the revenue and volume growth rate by 1.5%. Although there was an extra calendar day in the quarter, the strength of days in the quarter was approximately the same as last year. ","Third, margin. For the first quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 19.9% compared to 19.3% in the first quarter of 2011. We are very pleased with the margin improvement, which reflects the positive impact from our integration activities. ","Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of March, we had cash of $129.9 million and $500 million available under our revolving line of credit.","During the first quarter, we repurchased $122.3 million of stock representing 1.4 million shares. At the end of March, $462.1 million of repurchase authorization remained under our share repurchase program. ","This morning, we also reiterated our 2012 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth of 2% to 3.5%; adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, in the range of $6.75 to $7.05, excluding the impact of any share repurchase activity after March 31, 2012; operating cash flow of approximately $950 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $155 million.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Brad. We are very pleased with our first quarter 2012 results. We generated strong revenue growth. We delivered solid increases in core and esoteric volume. Revenue per requisition increased 1.2%. We lowered our bad debt rate to 4.4% during the quarter, reflecting the continued exceptional performance of our operational and billing personnel. ","We continue to make significant progress on each aspect of our Five Pillar Strategy. The first pillar of our strategy is that we deploy our cash to enhance our footprint and test menu through acquisitions and to repurchase shares. The acquisition market is attractive and we continue to see promising opportunities. As always, we will balance our execution of the first pillar of our strategy with good discipline around valuation.","The integrations of Genzyme Genetics and Orchid Cellmark are going well and are in line with our expectations. Our rebranding of the Genzyme Genetics business has been well accepted by our customers. As a reminder, we adopted the name Integrated Genetics for the reproductive portion of Genzyme's business and LabCorp's legacy genetics business, and we adopted the name Integrated Oncology for Genzyme's Oncology business and LabCorp's legacy oncology business.","Finally, we repurchased approximately $122 million of our shares in the first quarter. ","The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. We continue to see strong growth in the adoption of our Beacon platform. LabCorp Beacon order entry capability is now deployed to more than 11,000 sites and approximately 56,000 providers. ","We also have approximately 4,000 Beacon mobile users. We added a number of new features to Beacon in the first quarter, and we continue to receive positive feedback from users for its flexibility and functionality. We recently initiated our Beacon patient portal. This portal is a secure and easy-to-use online solution that enables patients to receive and share lab results, make appointments, pay bills, set up automatic alerts and notifications and manage health information for the entire family.","We have seen fast adoption and are on track with our plan to launch the portal nationwide this year. We continue to improve our electronic medical record connectivity. We added over 6,000 new client EMR interfaces in 2011 and are on pace to exceed that number in 2012. We continue to pursue our open platform strategy, allowing our customers to connect seamlessly to LabCorp directly or via the EMR of their choice.","Over the course of 2012, we will continue to expand our IT offerings with decision support, report improvements and additional patient- and physician-facing solutions. ","The third pillar of our strategy is to continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. In the first quarter, we continued our Touch AccuDraw system implementation to more than 200 additional sites. The system is now deployed in more than 1,300 sites across the country and is processing over 1.3 million accessions per month. ","We recently introduced iris [ph] digital pathology to improve pathology workflow. Instead of reviewing glass slides on a microscope and scoring them manually, this advanced diagnostic method allows our pathologists to read and score digital slides using image-based algorithms. This digital model allows creation of virtual centers of excellence, fosters collaboration with peers in remote locations and increases both efficiency and quality.","The expansion of our Burlington lab campus continues to go well. We have begun to consolidate several satellite locations into this state-of-the-art facility and will realize additional rationalization opportunities over time. We continue to move testing into this facility over the next several months to enhance specimen flow and streamline our process. ","The fourth pillar of our strategy is to continue scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We introduce new tests and collaborate with leading companies and academic institutions to provide physicians and patients with the most scientifically advanced testing in our industry. ","We recently enhanced our women's health initiatives by introducing a series of tests that are derived from a single collection swab, making collection of samples convenient. Our new swab tests offer clinically-validated profiles for targeted clinical conditions; are configured to be cost-effective for payers and patients; and provide high-quality results to guide diagnosis and treatment. Further, we offer panels, as well as individual tests, to give physicians appropriate choice in addressing patient needs. ","We also launched 4 additional tests to detect species of candida within our new swab portfolio. These additional tests are for patients with problematic or recurrent yeast infections and can be used when the most prevalent species of yeast infections are negative. This approach to our offerings again emphasizes physician choice, so testing is targeted and cost-effective.","We also recently launched additional HPV test offerings. LabCorp now offers multiple HPV testing options to aid in the detection of cervical cancer, allowing physicians to choose the method for papillate DNA testing that they deem best for their patients. ","Last month, we signed an exclusive agreement with OPKO Health for intellectual property associated with a potential Alzheimer's disease diagnostic.  OPKO has identified unique antibodies that appear to be elevated in Alzheimer's patients. We will be exploring these markers and their potential to help guide and improve patient care through a diagnostic test. ","The fifth pillar of our strategy is to develop alternative delivery models. We continue to discuss alternative models with our managed care partners. Though health care reform will likely change our payer mix and reimbursement systems, our goal remains to provide customers with the highest value for their laboratory spend. To this end, we are developing our Beacon lab benefit solution to provide payers, health systems and physicians a variety of options to improve laboratory quality and assist patients in receiving the right test at the right time. We intend to discuss these initiatives in more detail over the next several quarters. ","In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance and the progress we have achieved on our Five Pillar Strategy. Now Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.","Stephen Anderson","Thank you, Dave. Can you describe the impact of the SGR fix in 2013? As part of the SGR fix enacted in February, labs are slated to receive a 2% reduction to the clinical lab fee schedule, effective January 1, 2013. Further, absent any Congressional activity, mandatory sequestration, including an additional 2% reduction in the Medicare fee schedule, will be implemented effective January 1, 2013.","Can you update us on the status of the inquiry you received from the Senate Finance Committee? LabCorp continues to work closely with the staff of the Senate Finance Committee to respond to their request for information. We were the first company to meet with the committee staff, shortly after receiving their letter asking us to provide a responsive overview of how our contracts with managed care organizations work. We have provided the staff with hundreds of pages of documents responding to their request. We were disappointed by some recent comments reported in the press, which are not accurate, and we will continue to work closely with the committee to answer their questions and provide all appropriate information.","Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing? In the first quarter, approximately 41% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. As we reiterated last quarter, our goal is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 45% of our revenue within the next 3 to 5 years. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve. Thank you very much for listening. Again, I would remind you that we have a large number of analysts covering our stock at this time, and so we ask that you make your questions brief and please try not to repeat questions that have already been answered. We're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe just a question to start out here. So it seems like between seeing the Quest results and your results, it seems like volume trends appear to be stable here. Do you think that's a fair way to think about volume trends?","David P. King","Yes, Adam I think it is.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, and I'll be brief here. Just -- I guess, just -- as you think about the industry environment, Dave, with some of the backdrop in Washington and some of these cuts coming, how are you thinking about that in terms of creating M&A opportunities? And I guess, what are the implications of some of these cuts that are coming in the future?","David P. King","Well, I could speak for a long time about this and negate my own admonition that we should be brief. Let me just say, Adam that I think that the reimbursement environment from the government -- everybody knows we're facing a 2% cut that was implemented -- that will be implemented as part of the SGR fix. And it's mystifying to me that an industry that accounts for 1.6% of the total Medicare spend is bearing 15% of the savings that are generated from Medicare in that most recent SGR fix. So it's obviously going to be difficult on the industry. It's going to be difficult on smaller competitors, and that will provide some M&A opportunities. I would also say, though -- and I'll wear my chair of ACLA hat here for a moment, there are thousands of small independent labs in this country, and many of them serve niches such as nursing home and long-term care facilities that the major laboratories don't serve. Our model is an ambulatory model where people come to see us or specimens arrive from the doctor's office through our couriers. And going out and doing nursing home draws and the number of staffs required, it just doesn't fit within our model. So I have a serious concern that some of these cuts, particularly when you look at the operating margins of some of these smaller laboratories that serve long-term care facilities, are going to start to create real beneficiary access issues and cost issues for the Medicare program. So yes, there will be M&A opportunities, but there also will be long-term consequences for seniors if this trajectory of reimbursement cuts continues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Bonello with RBC.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So trying to understand a little bit the movement in gross margins year-over-year, the decline was the biggest it's been in a while, despite Genzyme's annualizing and the synergies that you noted in the proxy from Genzyme. And so I'm just trying to understand if that's due to the fact that volume growth was so strong in Q1 of last year, or is it just all the different acquisition moving parts? Or should we be extrapolating less of a benefit from mix, or maybe even price pressure?","William B. Hayes","Bill, it's Brad. I think it has more to do with the acquisition. So as you recall, we closed Orchid at the end of the fourth quarter of last year, so it's new basically in the first quarter, and we have -- we're early in the integration there. So we do have Genzyme integration and past acquisition integration that's benefiting. Some new acquisitions, and one that we're still integrating also from last year is Clearstone, in the clinical trial space. So I think it's a bag of -- a mixed bag of improvement in some, relative newness and still progress being made in others that is resulting in what we see there.","David P. King","And Bill -- Dave. Just to follow on that, Clearstone in particular, because of some of the European operations, until the synergies are fully realized, is a sizable -- has a sizable impact on gross margins.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I mean, is that really most of it, because I would just think that the contribution from those 2 acquisitions would have to have been relatively minimal, so -- I mean, even if they were at a huge discount to what your corporate gross margin is, it still seems like you'd be seeing a lot of gross margin pressure.","David P. King","Well, the thing is if you look all the way down the P&L, I mean, most of the savings that we're realizing from Genzyme are coming in the SG&A. So the gross margin profile of Genzyme is still not vastly superior to our typical corporate margin. And then when you add a sizable gross margin expense component with Orchid and Clearstone, it actually does drag it down pretty fast. So I'd say that is the vast majority, if not the single explanation for the gross margin decline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, the digital technology that you mentioned for the pathology sector, that sounds like the answer to what's been a nightmare process, I guess, a manual preparation and monitoring. Is this -- am I correct in viewing that as a material savings and capacity reduction opportunity, or will we not be able to see that in your numbers going forward?","David P. King","Bob, I think it is a material opportunity to generate savings for a couple of reasons. One, which is not insignificant, is just moving the glass slides around to different specialty pathologists. And the other is our ability to create virtual centers of excellence, where pathologists can review slides either individually or in collaboration without necessarily having to all be present. So I think there is savings opportunity there. Obviously, we have to scale it to the entire organization, but we've made a very solid start.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But it doesn't save you on your prep time, that manual process of receiving, cutting and staining?","David P. King","We're working on some automation tools for the prep, but it doesn't directly impact prep at this point. It just impacts review and scoring and reporting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One housekeeping question, one big picture question. First, just on the housekeeping side. Your noncontrolling interest is essentially gone here due to the buy up in Canada. The question is, do you expect to retain full ownership going forward there, or is the plan to sell equity to a local partner?","William B. Hayes","Dan, this is Brad. We do have people who are interested in that business and think it is important to have a local partner, so too early to call how that's going to end. But definitely something that we're interested in.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And for modeling purposes -- just timing. Should we keep minority or noncontrolling interest basically the same as what we saw in Q1? Any thought there, Brad?","William B. Hayes","I just think it's all incorporated in our range of guidance and wouldn't want to guide on a specific assumption like that.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. My big picture question, Dave, is you're at 1.5x leverage basically. You've hovered around 1.5x to 2x since doing Genzyme, and basically have maintained that leverage despite a lot of cash flow with fairly consistent buyback that we've seen over the last year. So I guess the question here is how are you thinking about optimal leverage? Is 1.5x to 2x the right range? And if so, I guess, shouldn't we really expect your share count to shrink in the high single-digit percentage range going forward?","David P. King","Darren, it's Dave. So I think the optimal leverage is 1.5x to 2x. And I think when you model 1.5x to 2x leverage and you model the cash that we generate, I think it's a reasonable assumption that either we're going to continue to do acquisitions with that cash or we're going to continue to repurchase shares. Or depending on the circumstances, obviously, we could consider the initiation of a dividend or other means of returning capital to shareholders. But yes, the optimal leverage is in that 1.5x to 2x range and our deployment of the cash generated over time, as it's traditionally been, would be first toward acquisitions and second toward share repurchase, absent some change in our capital philosophy.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just as far as buyback goes, I mean, because that's where the focus has been over the last year in large part in terms of your free cash flow, is there a way to help us think about just the deployment to keep that 1.5x to 2x leverage that you're referring to?","David P. King","Well, I'll let Brad comment on this. I mean, we're not paying down debt to delever. So the delevering comes naturally as EBITDA grows. I don't know that there's a good way to think about the amount of share repurchase because we have tried to be consistent other than to say it seems to me that the amount of share repurchase that we did in this quarter is sort of what we would think about as a fairly typical amount in an environment where we're not doing a lot of acquisitions.","William B. Hayes","Yes, Darren I'll just add to that. I mean, our philosophy is unchanged, as Dave alluded to. Our first goal is to grow this business, and a lot of that growth can come from acquisition, given the market share that we have and the number of other players that are out there. And we alluded to that earlier a little bit in the industry commentary about the cuts. So that's still #1. I think when those opportunities are not present, you see us go more to share repurchase. And yes, we do have additional leverage that we could take on to be at optimal levels, but we like to reserve that right to do for opportunistic situations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just had a question on the revenue per requisition growth in the quarter. So I'm curious, is there -- were there any moving parts there? So for example, acquisitions impacting it or sort of Genzyme-related contract changes impacting that metric this quarter?","David P. King","Amanda, it's Dave. I mean, there's always moving parts. The 2 probably biggest moving parts here were payer mix -- so we had, again, strong growth in the drugs of abuse testing, which is not at the average price point of the company; and then test mix, in that  obviously, as we've said for some time, vitamin D has flattened, histology is under pressure. So it's a combination, I would say, of payer mix and test mix that's -- we're not getting as much of a lift as we traditionally have gotten from mix, but I'm very pleased with the revenue per requisition result in the quarter.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, I got it. And then -- I know you don't give guidance specifically to the breakdown between revenue per req and volume growth, but is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of nuances other than the comp situation as we sort of progress through 2012 on both of those metrics?","David P. King","Well, since we don't give guidance on it, it would be hard for me to give you anything to think about.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then last question, you talked about Beacon in terms of the benefit management side of it. I'm curious just if you could talk to that offering, and are you getting traction in the marketplace at this point? Or is it early to -- if you can provide some more color on that offering.","David P. King","Sure, the idea of the Beacon Lab benefit system is to essentially combine a variety of options and provide a menu that -- whether it's a managed care plan, whether it's a health system or whether it's a physician practice can select from. So it runs the range from decision support to help physicians select the right test, to decision support at the time that we provide reports to help the physicians manage the patient optimally, to credentialing of providers to be able to order tests. I mean, there's a whole range of services within the lab benefit system that can be offered, depending on the desire of the customer. I would say it's early. There certainly is very strong interest in the market, again, ranging -- spanning the range from managed care plans to health systems to large physician practice groups, for some tools that will help them select the proper test; select the highest quality and most efficient, most effective, cost-effective laboratory to perform it; and provide support for the decision-making process at the time the results are delivered so that the patient can be treated better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, could you give us the drugs of abuse testing growth? I don't think Steve mentioned that in his prepared remarks.","William B. Hayes","Kevin, it's 6.4%.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then Dave, just wondering what the pricing environment is like now. We've heard a lot of comments about downward pressure coming from commercial payers. Just wondering if you have anything to add about that.","David P. King","Yes, Kevin. I mean, I think we all know the government pricing environment. Frankly, I was a bit surprised by the commentary yesterday on pricing. We, since 2007, 2008 when we had the pricing reset, I think we at LabCorp feel that we have been very disciplined on pricing and we've been successful in gaining real price increases over time. Now they're not gigantic [ph] real price increases, but we never said they would be. But unit price over time has improved. And so I guess any time that you're in a negotiation, people are -- we're trying to get more price and the managed care plans certainly are not saying we want to pay you more. But one, I don't think the environment has changed. Two, I think the environment is pretty stable. And three, I hope that the commentary yesterday didn't indicate that there's going to be some dramatic price cutting on the competitor side in search of volume, because what we've seen over time is that the industry is growing, volume is growing. And for the entire industry, pricing discipline is very important and we will continue to maintain pricing discipline here at LabCorp as we've done for the last 5, 6 years.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then suffice to say, you guys still continue to be the low-priced provider in the industry.","David P. King","We do. And everything that we do around here in terms of innovation and efficiency is designed to maintain that position.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then just a last follow-up on that, how are the efforts with the managed care plans going to shift volume from the high-cost setting? Is it too early to say anything, or do you have any data points you can give us?","David P. King","I think there's a renewed level of attention to it, or a greater level of attention to it. One of the comments that you do hear when you talk to people at managed care plans is that lab is really the only unmanaged area of spending. So everything else, there's preauthorization. There's radiology, mental health, hospital inpatient, emergency room. There's preauthorization or there's some kind of gatekeeping function. There is not and has not been that in lab. So that's part of what the lab benefit, the LBS, is designed to address. But it's also, even aside from the LBS, collaboration with the managed care partners to help them redirect cost to the more efficient providers. And it is going to require some lifting on their side, and I think we've seen more interest than in the past. But I think it's too early to say whether there are going to be tangible results.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then just one last quick one. The 1.2% -- the 2.8% volume growth, if we back out the 1.5%, is organic volume growth 1.3%? Or was there any tuck-ins in that?","David P. King","Well, there's no tuck-ins. Remember, there was Orchid. So the organic volume growth, we'd say, is approximately 1%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Two quick ones for you, Dave. Just first on SG&A, I think you mentioned that you were getting some of the benefit of integration sort of below the line. Can you maybe just update us on some of the details in terms of the types of things that you're embarking on now, whether it's Genzyme or where Westcliff stands, operationally, to just make sure we know what are sort of the -- what's going on, on the ground these days.?","David P. King","Yes. I mean, the big areas that you're going to see an impact from in SG&A are corporate support functions, billing, back office, bad debt expense. Exactly. Those are probably the major areas in which you would expect to see, and we are seeing, improvement in both of those that you called out, Genzyme and Westcliff.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. So I mean, I recognize there is some quarterly volatility naturally, but relatively speaking, and the types of numbers that we're seeing this quarter are relatively sustainable on the SG&A front, if not improved over time?","David P. King","Yes, I would think so, Tom.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking back to your comment earlier on the Medicare front, you noted that you were surprised that as a percent of the health care spend, I guess, you're bearing a larger burden of the cost -- or the savings for the government on the SGR. Do you have any idea why you think that happened? You've got the Senate sort of inquiry, if you will. You sort of took a disproportionate share of the burden on the SGR. How do you view the environment in Washington for the labs right now?","David P. King","Well, I think the environment in Washington for health care right now is pretty tough to begin with. And I think that when we were up on the hill and asking for the rationale behind the 2% reduction, the fundamental thing that kept being raised was that MedPAC had \"recommended a 10% reduction in the clinical lab fee schedule.\" Now if you look at the MedPAC recommendations, what they actually say is, if you had to fix the SGR over 10 years for $300 billion and it all had to come from Medicare, here are the things that would be cut. And they did say the lab fee schedule would be one of those things, and there were a whole variety of other hospital cuts. And so I think that -- and MedPAC specifically said that's not a recommendation, that's just, \"If we had to do it, this is one way you could.\" I think that got translated -- and if you look at the conference report on the legislation, that got translated into \"MedPAC recommended a 10% cut.\" So we're meeting with the MedPAC to try to clarify their position and clarify the position for the Hill. The other thing I would point out, not to suggest that -- I mean, we are very disappointed by the reimbursement reduction, but I think if you talk to the hospitals, they feel like they got hit pretty hard in the SGR fix. So there was a lot of pain for health care providers and it's -- we need to deal with the SGR fix as a long-term issue, not as a \"every year, there is a number that we have to find to stave off reductions in the physician fee schedule,\" which we know are never going to happen. And so every year, we know these reductions are never going to happen and yet we make long-term changes in the law regarding reimbursement for other providers that have consequences.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And just to close out the topic, you mentioned that maybe some of the press reports on the Senate issue were a little disappointing to you all. Do you have any better insights on when we might see something wrapped up relative to that investigation, or next data points or milestones we should be watching for?","David P. King","I don't, Tom. I think -- we've tried to be very cooperative. We met with the staff, we've turned over documents. They've given us a new request for information, which involve some pricing questions. And obviously, it's sensitive because it involves our contracts with other people. And they've made those requests not only of us, but of others. And I think everybody who has received those requests is evaluating them in terms of what it's appropriate to provide. So I don't have any timeframe for when we're likely to see this resolved, or when anybody else who has received the inquiry is likely to see it resolved.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, I would be interested to get your thoughts on some of the recent FTC decisions regarding some oppositions [ph] that have been proposed and kind of what you think the implications might be for the lab industry.","David P. King","You have anything in mind, Gary?","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No. Just -- I mean, the 2 big ones that people have been watching that are out there.","David P. King","Yes. I mean, I think it's hard for me to provide more commentary than the FTC provided. Obviously, they're -- as they defined the market in Medco Express, they found that the transaction was not anticompetitive. And as they looked at the market, or as they perceived the market in Omnicare PharMerica, they felt that the transaction was anticompetitive, which I guess would lead me to say that the definition of market is the critical factor in these determinations and if the market is defined broadly, transactions have an easier chance of succeeding than if the market is defined narrowly.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then question, Brad, maybe on the bad debts, it looks like you had some -- made some good progress in the quarter, although it looks like DSOs actually increased year-over-year and sequentially. So can you maybe just explain the dynamic there?","William B. Hayes","Yes. Sequentially, it's historic. We typically see about a 2-day rise between Q4 and Q1, just given the sales flow between the 2 quarters and the cash collection dynamics at the end of the year. So the sequential is sort of historical and in line. The one day year-over-year, I would say, is due to a several factors. One would be, we're having some experience from the implementation of 5010, the new electronic filing requirements, both on ourselves and the impact on our customers, on our physicians who end up paying us for laboratory services. They've had slowdowns. Another one would be, we still have -- not to the magnitude that we talked about last quarter, but a few lingering impacts of the Genzyme acquisition and conversion, but much, much smaller than the numbers we called out in the last several quarters. And last but not least, as we reduce the bad debt rate, it has some increase on DSO. But all in all, we look at our agents, we look at our allowance, we look at all of that and DSO in combination, and we're comfortable where we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you give us the contribution of Orchid and Clearstone to revenue in the quarter, and whether that would have a disproportionate impact to pricing versus volume?","David P. King","Ralph, it's Dave. I don't think it's material to either pricing or volume. Clearly, Clearstone is not, and I don't think Orchid is material to pricing or volume either. We've already given -- basically given you the volume contribution, which was about -- in the range of 30 basis points. So I don't think it's material to pricing.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just the revenue, overall revenue for these 2 in the quarter?","William B. Hayes","Ralph, it's Brad. We said last quarter that Orchid for the year would contribute a point to overall revenue. Clearstone was immaterial to call out and we haven't done that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess my second question, it's our understanding that Aetna recently made Genzyme Genetics out of network. Is there any way you can give us any sense of contribution there, maybe how we should think about that and your ability to sort of retain that if it does go out of network? And maybe even how we should think about sort of volume and pricing stat for the balance of the year, if you think that would have any impact if that volume shifted.","David P. King","Well, it is true that Genzyme was terminated from the Aetna contract. Just to give you some background there, post the acquisition, Aetna did extend the contract with Genzyme, which we were very pleased about. I don't think that Aetna was jumping up and down and turning cartwheels about the fact that this termination was going to occur. But I think they were contractually required to do it and they felt that, that was their contractual obligation. I think at the same time, the providers and patients, the Aetna providers and patients who use Genzyme's services, recognize the unique and differentiated value proposition. I disagree with the comment made yesterday that Genzyme doesn't offer anything that our competitor offers. I think that's just not the case. So we're going to continue to serve the Aetna patients and providers who want to use us and we hope that, that will be most of them. And we're going to continue to offer our test menu, our genetic counseling and our overall expertise in reproductive genetics and oncology, and we'll be honored and pleased if those providers and patients will continue to use us.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And any willingness to sort of give a sense of what the run rate of that -- of the  Aetna contribution is?","David P. King","No.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just my last one, I want to go back to -- you talked about sort of the somewhat uncontrolled cost on the lab side within kind of the managed care realm and not a lot of sort of preauthorization or medical policy in place. Is there -- have you guys looked at or is there any way you can estimate either what percentage of your -- either overall tests and\/or the esoteric or genetic or molecular tests that you'd estimate now have any preauthorization in [ph] medical policy? And then to that end, I mean, can you tell or do you think that, that has any impact on the pricing\/mix figure as we go forward and more of these things are put in place?","David P. King","Now first of all, I did not say uncontrolled cost. I said unmanaged utilization. There's not utilization management. That doesn't mean that managed care is not aggressively trying to control lab costs and working to control lab costs. So what I said is there's no utilization management in place for laboratory services, and that most other services in health care do have some form of utilization management. We have a very small number of situations in which we're subject to preauthorization, for a very limited number of tests. And I think this is something that is likely to increase over time. I don't think the issue is overutilization. I think the issue is not ordering the right test for the right patient at the right time. And I think, in fact, there are some circumstances in which better decision support will lead to more utilization of things like prenatal genetic screening, where it's not being properly utilized today. So I think long-term, the likely implications for us are relatively small. The hope is that it will encourage physicians and health systems to use testing more wisely and also to be cognizant of the cost of the testing that they're ordering when they make those decisions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Just for Dave. I guess, if you could provide a high-level outlook or change in thinking perhaps for 2012, and then where you started the year, it'd be helpful, because original guidance -- EPS guidance for the year, I guess, did not include share repurchases. You did $122 million in the quarter and, I guess, presumably did not forecast. The weather comp set, I think, added somewhere $0.04 to $0.05 in EPS. So by kind of reaffirming the guidance range, I guess, there's potentially a view from the market set that you may have become inherently more bearish on the 2012 outlook, so I guess any color you can give to that. And I guess for Brad, just a quick question on operating cash flow. It seems like for the first quarter, it's the lowest it's been since 2008 and I was just curious what the reason for that was.","William B. Hayes","So Dane, this is Brad. We'll go ahead with operating cash flow and I'll let Dave come back to the outlook. As we look at the operating cash flow for the quarter, it's entirely impacted by some working capital timing items, so we're maintaining our guidance for the year and feel like that's still appropriate guidance on the cash flow. So  entirely working capital timing-related on that metric.","David P. King","So Dane, on the guidance. I mean, let me first -- this notion that somehow the weather accounts for a beat of guidance does not make any sense to me. It does affect the year-over-year comp, but our guidance doesn't assume that we're going to have terrible weather. Our guidance assumes that we're going to have good weather. And your model, I don't think, assumed that we would have $0.05 negative of weather in there. So I don't think the weather has anything to do with the beat this quarter. I think what has to do with the beat this quarter is good volume, good pricing, good discipline around expenses. I'm not any more bearish than I was at the beginning of the year. I feel exactly the same way. We have one quarter in the book. We've always said that our guidance encompasses a wide range of outcomes, and we started out with what we feel is very realistic guidance. We didn't give you low guidance and allow ourselves a lot of room. We gave you very realistic guidance, and we're well within the range of outcomes that we expect. So we'll revisit the guidance next quarter, but I feel very, very comfortable. I think the year is going to shape up just as we've talked about. There's going to be better utilization trends. It's going to be better year-over-year comps for us because the comps get easier as we go along, and looking forward to a great year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just a quick follow-up on this pull-through whistleblower lawsuit. I'm obviously not going to ask you to comment on the merits of the overall case, because I doubt you want to do that on this call. But just procedurally, could the DOJ still potentially join the suit? And is there any deadline by which they either have to join or not join? Or should we just assume that if they haven't done it by now, they're not going to. I mean, just really any color on how to think about that would be helpful as we kind of ponder this overall case.","David P. King","Sure. I think the fact that the government has chosen not to intervene and allowed the lawsuit to be unsealed is significant because the suit was under seal for some period of time. The government, in my experience, did a thorough investigation and determined that they did want to intervene in this suit. And I believe they reached the same conclusion with regard to a related suit that had been filed against Quest. However, the government is never precluded from coming back and revisiting its decision not to intervene, so when the papers are filed, when the judge makes a ruling, the government -- up until the time the case is finally resolved, the government always has the opportunity to reconsider its position and advise the court that it would like to intervene. And obviously, we are hopeful that the government has done a thorough investigation and made a sound decision, but I can't rule out that they could change their mind.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just 2 quick clarifying questions. First, just going back to volume. When you talked about a 30 basis point contribution, you were talking about total acquired contribution, so year-over-year, the quarter's volume was 28, less 30 bips acquired, less 1.5 weather is how you got to the 1% organic number you talked about earlier. Is that right?","David P. King","Yes.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then second, for Brad. There was a question earlier about G&A levels and you had said something along the lines of considering kind of this level as the right way to think about it forward. I wasn't sure if you were talking about as a percent of revenue or on a dollar basis. Obviously you had about a $10 million step down in the fourth quarter that very nicely carried through to the first. So I guess, on a dollar basis, should we assume that, that kind of grows modestly with revenue growth, but generally at these new lower levels? Or is there anything through the year that might bounce it up?","William B. Hayes","Nothing through the year that I can think of. So I'd think of it on an absolute dollar basis before I would as a percent of sales because sales can vary. And bad debt would be the only thing I can think of that would make the absolute dollar value grow as sales change. And I would say that there are integration activities that are ongoing, that are working to further help that metric. But I'd be careful also with the overall dollars, because there can be things like payroll days that vary quarter-to-quarter. But generally speaking, I think absolute dollars ability [ph] are something that we would strive for.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure. We had that nice step down in the fourth quarter that was kind of maintained. I just want to make sure there's nothing material to sort of that run rate that might be not contemplated, but it sounds like the answer is no.","William B. Hayes","Nothing we can think of.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a couple of soft [ph] questions. First of all -- so obviously we know what the weather impact was on volume, but can you just provide us what the same store growth, excluding weather, was for core?","David P. King","No. We've given you the volume number. That's what we give, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So when we back into -- based on the information that you provide, I think you get 2% core volume. Should I make the assumption that weather has more impact on one segment versus the other? Or more impact on core versus esoteric?","David P. King","No. Look, the number we gave was 2.8%. 1.5% benefiting from weather and about 30 basis points benefiting from Orchid. So that's 1% core volume growth. We also gave you the year-over-year esoteric growth. My view is weather is weather. It affects volume indiscriminately and largely equally. And so I don't think there's anything in the 1% number that can be further chopped or refined to get at a better sense of volume. And certainly, I just -- we can pick apart these numbers all day long, but the reality is the core business grew, the esoteric business grew, we feel good about both of them.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly -- I mean, I know that you said in response to a question before that you feel exactly the same as you felt before. But I actually get the sense that you feel better, because you said that you actually expect better utilization trends for the remainder of the year, which -- I think in past quarters, you said that the environment -- utilization environment, it continues to be to some degree challenging. So I actually see that the tone is more positive. So is there something that you're seeing maybe kind of like 2Q to-date or something that you see in terms of kind of like share shift that makes you more optimistic as to how volumes are progressing for the remainder of 2012?","David P. King","I obviously am not going to talk about 2Q today. Again, I feel that we have been very consistent from the fall forward that we felt that we would see better utilization in 2012. We felt that over the year, utilization would pick up and sort of return to what we hope will be a more normal environment as we get late in 2012 and into 2013, and that the comps would improve because last year we had deceleration. I feel exactly the same way. I don't feel better. I don't feel worse. I feel very confident and comfortable with the guidance range that we've given, with the performance in the quarter and with the fact that we're executing well on our priorities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Gavin Weiss in for Lisa. Just a quick one to clarify your comments on the extra calendar day. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. I know it's a leap year, but there's a timing around New Year's. Your revenue days are the same, correct?","David P. King","Well, the way that we analyze that, Gavin, is strength of days. And what Brad said is the strength of days was approximately the same year-over-year.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on Palmetto, I know it's set to go into effect on May 1. Are you still actively fighting this?","David P. King","I think the -- we and ACLA have been working very closely with Palmetto. We feel like they made some major improvements to their program, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to have a collaborative effort in their endeavors to do a better job pricing and paying for molecular testing and our endeavors to make sure that we get fairly paid for the valuable service we provide.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group.","Brian Zimmerman","It's actually Brian in for Anthony. I guess just first, could you elaborate a little bit more on -- sorry, I think you did answer that question. So the drugs of abuse testing, you've captured share of drugs of abuse testing over the last quarter -- almost every quarter for the last couple of years now. What's driving that share capture? And are you seeing strength of drugs of abuse testing in areas -- in regional areas where you're stronger, or how is pricing in that business?","David P. King","Pricing in the business is quite stable. Obviously, as we've said many times, it's below our average price point per requisition. I think we've done a good job in drugs of abuse testing. Again, all of the underlying investments we've made in improving the quality of service at our patient service centers, all the investments we've made in the touch system and AccuDraw and all the things that we're doing have led to, in my view, better and more consistent levels of service facing the patient,  and that's what drugs of abuse testing is all about. So I think it's -- the drugs of abuse testing gains great -- it gains great leverage and synergy from the core business -- from the patient service centers, from the transportation, the couriers. And I think all the investments we've made to improve service are why we're seeing positive results there.","Brian Zimmerman","All right. And then also, can you quantify or somehow frame the margin impact from the European operations of Clearstone, and sort of what's the timeframe of the integration of those ops, so when we'll start to see that margin improvement?","David P. King","I don't think we want to get into that level of detail about that business.","Brian Zimmerman","Okay. Not even on the timeframe of the integration?","David P. King","Not even on the timeframe of the integration.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just had one question to ask on a long-term picture for cash deployment. If you look at consensus estimates, it does appear the Street is more or less assuming that you sit on the majority of the cash that you're going to generate. So based on what you said in your previous commentary here, my question is, if you guys don't find compelling acquisition opportunities, would it be conceivable that you would deploy all of your free cash to share repurchase or dividends, particularly if the volume environment remains tepid beyond this year?","David P. King","Well, yes, it's conceivable. I don't think it's likely, because I think there will be attractive acquisitions, but if there are not attractive acquisitions to make, we're certainly not going to sit on the cash and let it build. ","We're right at an hour, so we're going to try and be done here in the next 5 minutes if we can.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Art Henderson with Jefferies & Company.","Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Dave, can you remind us just what contracts are up for renewal this year on the managed care side, if you have any big national ones, and how the outlook is there?","David P. King","The only contract that's up for renewal this year on the national level is Humana, and we're engaged in discussions with them and feel quite comfortable about where we are. So that's it for managed care in 2012 -- major national managed care.","Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And what's the outlook in 2013 on that?","David P. King","We have some renewals coming up in 2013 and again obviously, it's very early in discussions and again, feel good that we'll be in a good position to tell you more as things progress.","Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And Dave, did the Horizon BlueCross BlueShield, did that contract get resolved or is that still ongoing as well?","David P. King","Yes, we did renew that contract over a multi-year period on the same terms and conditions that were previously in place.","Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then earlier, you were talking about the HPV assay. Is that a new DNA test? Is that -- refresh my memory on that.","David P. King","What's happened is that other competitors have entered the market and normally, Art, we don't offer multiple versions of testing for the same analite. [ph] But in this case, because of Roche being in the market and some other competitors having entered the market, we're offering multiple options for the physicians to choose the HPV assay that they would like.","Arthur I. Henderson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I see. Okay. And then last question for Brad, the DSO, I know you talked about it ticking up. Does it go back to the levels that we saw in the previous quarters?","William B. Hayes","I think so, yes.","David P. King","Well, thank you very much for listening. I want to make one additional comment. As you know, at the end of April, Dr. Mohapatra will be retiring from Quest and I wanted to say that although a competitor, Surya has been a strong collaborator in our activities at ACLA and for the broader industry, and he's been a strong advocate for diagnostics and for our industry. So we certainly -- we'll miss Surya and wish him well in his future endeavors and we wish you all a good day. Thank you all for listening.","David P.

[Operator Instructions]. ","I would now like to introduce the host for this conference call, Ms. Clarissa Willett, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, ma'am.","Clarissa Willett","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an investor relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures during -- discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to estimated 2020 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on operating and financial results, expected savings and synergies and the opportunity for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change based on various factors, many of which are beyond our control that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, included in each case under the Risk Factors and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. ","And now I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.","Adam Schechter","Thank you, Clarissa, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to speak with you today, and thank you for joining the call. For more than 50 years, LabCorp has grown and prospered by putting talented people behind a vital health care mission, improving health and improving lives. We deliver world-class diagnostic solutions, bring innovative medicines to patients faster and use technology to improve the delivery of care, that is unwavering.","As I've begun to travel to meet colleagues from around the world, I see that we have dedicated employees at every level from phlebotomists to couriers to lab technicians, critical research associates and scientists, all of whom care deeply about the mission and the success of LabCorp. I am excited about the opportunities for LabCorp to achieve its mission and to drive profitable growth into the future. ","To that end, we had a solid fourth quarter in 2019, and we are well positioned for growth this year. During the fourth quarter, we saw progress across both our Diagnostics and our Drug Development businesses. Our Diagnostics business grew revenue by 3.7%, concluding a year of strong growth given the headwind of PAMA. Although margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter, PAMA had a negative impact of 130 basis points. Our Drug Development business grew revenue by 9.3%, while margins expanded 130 basis points, and we approved our trailing 12 months book-to-bill to 1.29. ","We closed out 2019 with revenue of over $11.5 billion, adjusted EPS of $11.32 and free cash flow of over $1 billion. We also made strategic acquisitions of $876 million and returned $450 million to our shareholders through share repurchases. ","PAMA was a significant headwind for us in 2019, and I'm pleased with our performance given its impact. While we appreciate that congress passed the LAB Act back and that delays the next PAMA date of reporting period by 1 year until 2021, regrettably, the legislation did not halt the reimbursement cuts that went into effect this year. We continue to pursue both the legislative solution and our industry litigation with the goal of correcting the improper implementation of PAMA. ","Before I shift to discussing our priorities for 2020 and beyond, I want to take a moment to discuss LabCorp's response to the 2019 novel coronavirus. As a leading global life science company, we have nearly 65,000 employees around the world and are doing business in more than 100 countries, including China and surrounding geographies. Our teams have been mobilized since the first reports of this virus to protect our employees, to communicate transparently with our customers, to manage our supply chain and to support the global health care response. We immediately engaged with the CDC on the status of its test becoming available to commercial labs and utilizing our own expertise in PCR and testing for other strains of coronavirus. We have also begun to work on our own test for the novel coronavirus. I am pleased with our rapid response, which has been focused on the well-being and safety of employees and patients, supporting business continuity for us and our customers and preparing to support the global response, if necessary. ","Moving now to 2020. Our guidance includes continued profitable growth and significant cash flow generation that we plan to deploy through strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. We continue to focus on our 5 key priorities, which include the following: first, we continue to leverage the power of our uniquely combined capabilities across Diagnostics and Drug Development. Second, we will win on oncology by using our breadth of capabilities to win in the fastest-growing therapeutic area. Third, we're integrating data, artificial intelligence, digitization and analytics across our business. Fourth, we are putting our customers at the center of all we do. And fifth, we continue to focus on high-growth opportunities. ","As examples, we've recently announced 2 new offerings that underscore our ability to deliver on the power of our combined businesses. First is the launch of our expanded suite of decentralized trial solutions, which seamlessly integrates Covance, central labs, LabCorp's specialty diagnostic labs, direct-to-patient market access call centers and a suite of technology solutions to bring the trial closer to a patient and to streamline trial execution. ","The second is our cell and gene therapy development solutions, which offer a coordinated approach to scientific and program consultation, biomarker and companion diagnostic development, study management and regulatory commercialization support activities and capabilities. ","With these two new offerings, we are well positioned to partner with sponsors, to address complexity, to reduce cost and risk and to effectively accelerate time lines for their novel therapies. We will continue to focus and execute against these 5 key executable priorities, which will help us achieve our goals to strengthen our market-leading positions in Diagnostics and Drug Development, to grow strategic opportunities that drive new business and to break away based upon our unique offerings, capabilities and financial performance. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn to discuss more specifically our financial performance and our 2020 guidance.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2020 guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of 6% over last year, driven by the benefit of acquisitions net of divestitures of 3.9%, and organic growth of 2.3%, which includes a 90 basis point negative impact from PAMA. In addition, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue growth by 20 basis points. ","Operating income for the quarter was $336 million or 11.4% of revenue compared to $308 million or 11% last year. During the quarter, we had $21 million of restructuring charges and special items primarily related to Launchpad initiatives, acquisition integration and executive transition costs partially offset by an additional insurance reimbursement payment for costs related to the 2018 ransomware attack. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $422 million or 14.3% of revenue compared to $395 million or 14.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to Launchpad savings; organic growth and acquisitions, net of divestitures, partially offset by the impact from PAMA; higher personnel costs and cybersecurity investments. ","The tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% or 22.9% excluding special charges and amortization. This adjusted tax rate was favorable to our fourth quarter implied tax rate of 110 basis points or $0.04 per share primarily due to changes in state tax law treatment that occurred during the quarter. We expect the company's adjusted tax rate for the full year 2020 to be approximately 25% compared to 24.6% for 2019. ","Net earnings for the quarter were $227 million or $2.32 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $2.86 in the quarter, up 13.5% compared to last year. Adjusted earnings in the quarter benefited from top line growth, margin expansion and our share repurchase program. ","Operating cash flow was $570 million in the quarter compared to $486 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings partially offset by increased working capital to support growth. Capital expenditures totaled $128 million or 4.3% of revenue compared to $122 million or 4.4% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $442 million in the quarter compared to $364 million last year. This brings our full year free cash flow to $1.04 billion, up from $926 million in 2018. We remained active throughout the quarter in terms of capital allocation, investing in acquisitions, share repurchases and debt pay down. At year-end, we had $6.2 billion in total debt, translating to leverage of 3.1x gross debt to last 12 months EBITDA. ","Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, an increase of 3.7% compared to last year due to the benefit of acquisitions net of divestitures of 3% and organic growth of 0.8%. And excluding the negative impact from PAMA and the managed care contract changes, organic revenue grew 3.2%. In addition, the benefit of 1 additional revenue day in the quarter was largely offset by the impact from the nonrenewal the BeaconLBS UnitedHealthcare contract in the Florida market. ","Total volume, excluding divestitures, increased by 2.6% over last year, of which acquisition volume was 1.8% and organic volume was 0.8%. The benefit from 1 additional revenue day of 1.6% was essentially offset by the negative impact from the managed care contract changes of 1% and lower consumer genetics demand of 0.4%. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 0.8% to our volume growth. ","Revenue per acquisition, excluding the impact from divestitures, increased by 1.6% due to acquisitions. Favorable mix, including lower consumer genetics demand, was offset by the negative impact from PAMA of 150 basis points and the nonrenewal of the BeaconLBS contract of approximately 150 basis points. ","LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $277 million or 15.8% of revenue compared to $279 million or 16.5% last year. The decline in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to the negative impact of PAMA, higher personnel costs and cybersecurity investments partially offset by top line growth and Launchpad savings. ","The benefit from the additional revenue day in the quarter was offset by the negative impact from the nonrenewal of the BeaconLBS contract and managed care contract changes. We remain on track to deliver $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021 from Diagnostics' Launchpad initiative. ","Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, an increase of 9.3% compared to last year due to the benefit of acquisitions, net of divestitures, of 5.2% and organic growth of 4.6% partially offset by foreign currency translation of 40 basis points. Excluding pass-throughs, organic revenue continued to grow in the mid- to high single digits. ","Adjusted operating income for the segment was $183 million or 15.2% of revenue compared to $154 million or 14% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to Launchpad savings, acquisition net of divestitures and organic growth partially offset by higher personnel costs. We remain on track to deliver $150 million of net savings by the end of 2020 from Drug Developments' Launched at initiative. For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $5.9 billion and 1.29, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $11.3 billion, an increase of around $600 million from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.2 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. ","Now I'll discuss our 2020 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, for the entire year. In addition, enterprise guidance includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions and share repurchases. Also, as 2020 is a leap year, the company will have 1 additional revenue and payroll day primarily impacting the Diagnostics business. Additional details on the impact of days can be found in the supplemental financial presentation posted on our website. We expect revenue growth of 4% to 6% over 2019 revenue of $11.6 billion. This guidance includes the negative impact from divestitures of 0.2% and the benefit from foreign currency translation of 40 basis points. We expect LabCorp Diagnostics' revenue growth of 0.5% to 2.5% over 2019 revenue of $7 billion. This guidance includes the negative impact from PAMA of 1.3% and the nonrenewal of the BeaconLBS contract of 0.9%. In addition, revenues are expected to benefit from 1 additional revenue day of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 10 basis points. ","We expect Covance Drug Development revenue growth of 7% to 9.5% over 2019 revenue of $4.6 billion. This guidance includes the negative impact from divestitures of 0.5% and the benefit from foreign currency translation of 70 basis points. We continue to expect organic revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $11.75 to $12.15, which is an increase of 4% to 7% over 2019 adjusted EPS of $11.32. Free cash flow is expected to be $950 million to $1.05 billion compared to $1.04 billion last year. ","In 2020, we expect capital expenditures to be between 3.5% and 4% of revenue, driven by investments to support growth and productivity. ","This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Adam, as your first quarter as CEO, I was just curious if you could talk about maybe the go-to-market strategy at Covance given some of the leadership changes. Just how you feel, your ability to go and win business there? And one of your big customers talked about some pipeline reprioritizations at the end of the year. Just any cancellation activity or anything in the fourth quarter, or any expectations in the 2020 guidance related to that?","Adam Schechter","Sure, Jeff. As I look at our strategy, I think we're uniquely positioned to be successful in the marketplace. And it starts with the fact that we have so much data from our diagnostics. We do over 500 million tests per year. And when we use that data to try to help stratify disease or to develop companion diagnostics or develop assays, I think we're uniquely qualified to work with pharma, whether it be biotech or big pharma, to help them figure out which patients are most likely to respond to their medicines or vaccines. And then we can work with them through all phases of their clinical development and, ultimately, help with registration and then in-market capabilities that we have. So we have the full spectrum, strategically, of what I believe biotech and large pharma is looking for, and I truly believe we're unique in that manner. ","Right now, we're doing very well in early development. We continue to grow in the small to medium biotech area. I'd like to see us do even better with large pharma. Based upon recent announcements and stuff, we don't see any significant impact to our business as we go into 2020. And based upon the numbers in the guidance that we provided today, hopefully, you'll see that we continue to believe that we have real strength and momentum as we go into 2020. ","One of my strategic pillars is really maximizing the power of the combined, and I believe that disproportionately will help the Drug Development business because I believe that the diagnostic capabilities we have will be more helpful to the Drug Development business than the other way around.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","Adam, I appreciate your comments on the coronavirus, but I just want to follow up to understand if you have anything in your guidance for 2020. So you talked about the impact to the supply chain, also talked about exposure, having employees in the Asian market. Has there been disruption in any of the studies you're doing in the Asian market? How do we think about any potential impacts that might have on your 2020 guidance?","Adam Schechter","Sure. Thank you for the question, Lisa. And as we look at the coronavirus and where we stand today, we believe that everything would be covered within the ranges that we've provided to you. And we've seen some minimal impact, particularly in China with people coming back to work a bit later. When the coronavirus first came out, there was a little bit less people coming to work, but we believe that it's all manageable within the year. We'll have to watch quarter-by-quarter if there's any minor impacts. But over the year period of time, we think that we'll be fine based upon what we know today. Obviously, if things change with the coronavirus and it becomes more of a global issue or if it impacts China for an extended period of time, things may change. But based upon everything that we know today and based upon the guidance that we've provided, we believe that it covers what we foresee could happen based upon today's knowledge of the coronavirus.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore.","Michael Newshel","Can you just give an update on the lab M&A environment? Looks like you can continue to do some more tuck-ins, and maybe just talk to the pace you're expecting there. And maybe just like even broader, just what your capital allocation plans are for 2020? Or the mix of share repo and M&A that's embedded in your guidance?","Adam Schechter","Yes. Sure. First of all, I would say we feel good about our ability to grow based upon what we have today in our Diagnostics and our Drug Development business. I don't see any major things that we're missing in order for us to be successful and compete successfully in environments that we compete within. But when I think about capital allocation specifically around acquisitions, here's the way I think about it: first is the regional and local labs or hospital labs acquisitions that you can do. I think those are great use of capital. They can be accretive in the first year. They typically return their cost of capital within 2 or so years. And we know how to integrate those, and we know how to make this happen very quickly. ","The environment right now continues to be building, I would say. They take longer than what I would have expected for them to take. We have a long list of potential tuck-in acquisitions, and we continue to work through those. There's no break in our step from our capabilities to do that, it's more how quickly we can get the customers in the regional or local labs to consider moving forward. I believe, as people have seen the impact of PAMA and they've seen some of the pricing that's occurred that they're more open today to have those discussions than they have been in the past. ","Next, I'd look at whether there's strategic needs that we have. For example, do we need to look at building our presence in Japan or China? And if we have to do those things in order to be successful, they're typically very small in nature. I'd look to see if we can build them ourselves. If not, and there's a small acquisition, we would consider those. ","And then, of course, we look at everything that's out there. But as I said, I don't see the need, as I sit here today, for any type of large-scale acquisition or change because I believe we have what we need to be successful as we go into 2020. We'll, of course, look at everything, but that's how I think about the allocations. And then we use share repurchases if there are not as many acquisitions as we may like within the cash flow that we generate each year.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. Mike, the only thing I'd add to that is, as you know, we've discussed that from our guidance standpoint, we are assuming that the full usage of our free cash flow will be deployed, as Adam said, to both M&A and share repurchases. Obviously, we don't break that out as far as an outlook, but just from a modeling purposes, assume that, that is reflected into our ranges that we provided.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.","Kevin Caliendo","I just want to talk a little bit about your diagnostic revenue outlook. You can break it down between organic growth and sort of what you expect organic growth, M&A contribution, revenue per rec, any sort of guidance around those metrics? And also maybe what you're expecting incrementally with regards headwinds or from market access changes?","Adam Schechter","Sure. I'll start, and then Glenn can add, Kevin. So as I look at the Diagnostic business, I first think about what's the underlying growth that you see in volume. And if you go back, for many years, you'd typically see the underlying growth between 1% to 2%. And I don't see any reason that, that's going to change as we look forward to the future. I believe that, that growth will continue to be in the future what it's been in the past. ","So then I think about what can we do to try to increase our growth rate versus the underlying growth rate. The first thing is I mentioned the tuck-in acquisitions. I think that those are very beneficial and a good use of capital. I don't put a specific number into the plan for those because it really depends on what's available, how many are willing to move in any given year and whether or not they all make good financial sense because we have a really strong financial fiscal acumen that we apply to any acquisition. So I don't build into the plan that we have to do a certain amount of volume based upon those acquisitions. ","The second thing you can do is try to shift share. And when I think about shifting share, I think about things like the PLN that United is launching. I don't assume that there'll be a significant shift in 2020 because they're rolling it out as we speak. But if successful, in the future, I believe that, that could benefit a lab like us where we have very high-quality at lower cost. ","And as I think about the future, if it works for United, I think that other organizations may see this as an opportunity to help them reduce their laboratory costs by moving over business to a lab like ours. So I believe that we will, over time, be able to shift some share, which will help us to grow our volume faster than the underlying market growth. I don't anticipate that this year, but I anticipate, if it's successful, it would happen in future years. So that's kind of how I think about the underlying dynamics within the marketplace.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. Kevin, I'll just add a little bit of color to that. So to your point that when you look at our guidance range for Diagnostics, next year, we have around 0.5% to 2.5%. We did comment on kind of the unusual, if you will, headwinds and tailwinds that we expected for 2020, another year of the impact of PAMA, plus just the annualization of the Beacon contract, but also Diagnostics benefiting from an extra revenue day, slight favorability with currency. So when you take out those 4 kind of items that are around a constraint of around 1.7%, you can kind of get to see that we're looking at north of a 3% growth rate with everything else, which is effectively the annualization of acquisitions already completed, plus organic growth. And to Adam's point, from a forecast standpoint, we talk about normalized organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%. And in fact, this past year, we were at the upper end of that range from, again, a normalized basis, taking out those impacts. And within the guidance range, that's a fair assumption. So organically, again, the 2% to 3% continues to be an expectation within the range, plus the addition of those annualized acquisitions and then the net impact of those headwinds.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.","Daniel Leonard","Maybe on Covance for the 2020 outlook, can you be specific about what you expect the pass-through headwind to look like in 2020 and maybe offer what it was in 2019? And then on the margin side, how much of margin expansion do you expect you could achieve in Covance in 2020?","Adam Schechter","Dan, so as I look at Covance, I first want to say that we're pleased with the performance. And I think that our revenue growth and our book-to-bill continues to be strong. I'll start with the margins. If you look at the margins, we had expansion in the fourth quarter of 130 basis points. As we look at margins next year, we expect to have an improvement in margins once again, albeit not as much as what we saw in 2019. We announced our Launchpad initiative across the enterprise is $350 million. For the Drug Development, it's $150 million, and we're on track to achieve that. ","As we look forward to the future, I think we're going to have to continue to push cost across all of the businesses, even above and beyond what we have in Launchpad. It just has to be a mindset going into the future in terms of continued increased productivity. So if you look at the full year, we grew at about 6.8% ex pass-throughs, and I would say that's probably a pretty good read for what next year should look like -- 2020 should look like.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. Dan, just the other thing I'd add is that when you think about 2019, pass-throughs were down, call it, around 10%. So given the volatility of that in a particular quarter, and it was primarily in the first, but it did impact each quarter a bit, but in the first, it was the most. We've kind of called it out a bit and talked about that our organic revenue excluding pass-throughs would be within the guidance range of the 5.5% to 7.5% last year. And in fact, again, our organic growth was probably a little bit north -- or was a little bit north of the center of the range. So we felt good with the overall organic performance of the business, taking out that volatility of pass-throughs, and really good performance across the spectrum of our businesses. ","Really doesn't change our outlook for 2020 much other than for, again, forecasting purposes, we've assumed that normal increase in pass-throughs commensurate with the business growth that we have of which pass-throughs are more aligned to it. So that -- again, thinking about mid- to high single-digit growth rate, think about it as organic revenue within that range both with and without pass-throughs. Each quarter, to the extent that we see volatility in that, we'll again call it out just to focus on, obviously, the big driver, which is the revenue without pass-throughs. But hopefully, it'll align better in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe","If I look at revenue distribution, Covance is about 40% of revenue. And if I calc on earnings, it's about 35%. I guess the question is, given the faster top line and margin expansion within Covance and the somewhat more muted revenue growth from the lab side and some margin contraction there on top of sort of maybe the M&A opportunities and fragmentation certainly within the CRO space, I guess, how quickly do you see the business moving closer to more of a maybe 50-50 type split? And\/or do you have a target as you think about sort of the split of the 2 businesses going forward?","Adam Schechter","Yes. Sure. Thanks, Ralph. So first of all, I don't have a target for the percent of the businesses moving forward. And if you noticed, I used the words Diagnostics and Drug Discovery because I don't think of it as just LabCorp and Covance, I think of it as a spectrum of offerings that we have for our customers that are linked together in order to make us successful. ","Obviously, the clinical trial business continues to grow at a faster rate in terms of -- Drug Development grows at a faster rate. And therefore, if you look at the way in which you look at it, over time, I would expect that, that becomes a larger part of our total percent of revenue. But I think a big reason that, that will grow faster is because of our capabilities that we have within the diagnostic area. So to me, they're intricately linked. When we look at the acquisitions that I spoke about before, the tuck-ins in the Diagnostic area in local lab and regional labs as well as hospital labs, I think, are a good use of our capital. So you'll continue to see some acceleration through those acquisitions. If the PLN works in which the way we think it might, I believe that we'll see additional growth there. So to me, it's really about making sure that we have good fiscal discipline, that we put our money behind the opportunities that give us the best growth, but it's a complete continuum of offerings that we have versus just looking at it one segment versus the other.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rivka Goldwasser Morgan Stanley.","Rivka Goldwasser","So some follow-up questions here. First of all, Glenn, on Kevin's question regarding the pricing, it seems that in the fourth quarter, pricing was really strong even when you normalize for PAMA and the Beacon headwinds, 1.6 in acceleration. So maybe you can help us parse the benefit from the tuck-in acquisition that you did in the quarter and how they contributed to it? And should we think about that 1.6 as the right run rate for 2020? ","And then on the CRO side, Adam, for you, if you can give us maybe some more color on what's Covance win rate? And what's a realistic goal that you think about longer-term as you continue to better align the capabilities of the Diagnostic and Drug Discovery business?","Adam Schechter","Sure. I'll start with the second question, and then we can have Glenn work on the first one. With regard to our Covance business, as I said before, in early development, I look at share in addition to win rate. As I look at early development, I think we do really well, and we disproportionately win in early development. As we start to look at how we do in the small- to medium-sized biotech, I think we do very well there also, and a lot of growth has come from that segment over time. Where I'd like to see us do better is in the big pharma segment. And I believe we will be able to do that for several reasons. One is, one of our key pillars is to win in oncology. ","And I think we have a very unique set of capabilities in oncology from our ability to develop companion diagnostics and assays, all the way through doing the clinical trials, identifying the patients most likely to respond, but also helping to find the patients based upon our large amount of data that we have in the diagnostic area. And I also believe that, that's the fastest-growing largest area for pharma. If you look at the number of compounds as a percent in oncology, it's very significant. So when we win there, I think we'll be able to show that we can also do well in other areas, such as specialty, neurology and other areas. So to me, winning in oncology is important because it allows us to be successful in other areas over time. So that's an area that I want to see continued growth in large pharma, in oncology, and I'd like to see us disproportionately win share in that segment.","Glenn Eisenberg","Okay. Ricky, on the -- with regard to revenue per acquisition, so the 1.6 for the quarter was a strong number for us, but we commented that it was acquisition driven. And as you think about our organic pricing, we did talk about, obviously, the headwinds coming from PAMA and Beacon combined of around the 3% headwind. So as we think about the quarter, firstly, going back to, call it, normalized, backing up those unusual items, and from an organic standpoint, again, the 2% to 3% organic revenue growth, the quarter would have come in at the upper end of that range, as we did for the full year. So if we think about a normal environment, and that, I think, started the conversation, we're saying kind of organic volume of 1% to 2%, and then, let's say, we pick up volume on price to get to the 2% to 3% range. As we think about our outlook, that's normally the way we gauge. Each quarter, we may see a little bit of fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter. But again, as we think about 2020, we still have within our guidance range, call it, that organic normalized growth of that 2% to 3% with a pretty normal 1% to 2% volume and the rest being price.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut.","Brian Tanquilut","Just to follow up on Kevin's question earlier, Glenn, how are you thinking about market share shift within the contract? I mean should we expect more network access changes impacting organic growth? And I guess, a follow-up on that last comment you guys made on the lab -- on the acquisition from hospital. I think, Adam, you talked about the pace being slower than you expected. So is there anything you guys see in the horizon that will accelerate that? Or anything that LabCorp and proactively do to get the deals -- the larger deals going?","Adam Schechter","Yes. Brian, this is Adam. First of all, when you look at the environment and market share, particularly if you look at managed care, we've kind of overlapped the markets -- or the managed care losses that we had in last year as we go through the first quarter of this year. So the first quarter of this year should be the last quarter where you see that overlapping occur. So therefore, for the majority of the year, I don't see any additional significant downside based upon the managed care contract changes that occurred last year. ","As I look at 2020, I don't see any significant managed care shifts, such as United or Horizon, that we saw last year. So I don't see that type of volatility. As I look at the hospital tuck-in acquisitions, what I can tell you is our list is long. There are many discussions that we're having around the country with both local and regional labs and hospitals. It's not a lack of resources that we're putting behind it, we'll put resources that we need to, to be successful there, it's the discussions that we're having with our customers. I believe, over time, it will begin to accelerate, particularly as they feel the continued impact for PAMA. And if you look at what we're expecting from PAMA, we expect this year's impact to be about the same as last year. So '19 was about $100 million. This year will be about another $100 million. And I think 2021, barring any change to legislation or legal, we'll be about the same. These regional local labs are feeling that as well. And I think that, that pressure will continue to want to make them evaluate us working with them or buying their labs as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc.","Donald Hooker","One of the maybe a smaller area of focus for you guys, maybe, but in terms of your investments and the accelerate informatics functionalities that you guys have developed over the years at Covance, I was curious kind of -- at a high level, kind of where you're seeing success there in terms of using IT to drive trials. You have a number of tools there. Just would love to hear an update on that part of Covance.","Adam Schechter","Sure. You saw one of the pillars of the strategy is to utilize data, analytics, artificial intelligence and basically everything that we do, including our ability at Covance. I also mentioned some of the new offerings that we have, and one of which was the virtual trials and the hybrid trials. A lot of that is based upon our ability to use information, to use technology in a better, different way than we've done in the past than we do today. We will continue to ensure that we're at the leading edge of understanding the hybrid and virtual trials, that we invest in the technology necessary to be successful in those areas. And I believe that as we move forward and we use the power of our combined organization, the ability to use data and analytics in our 500 million data points that we get every year from diagnostics and understand how to use that in Drug Development to help identify patients better, enroll trials faster, is going to be more and more important. So that's why it's 1 of our top 5 pillars of our strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin","A couple of questions. I guess the first one, can you talk a little bit about the operating margin in lab? It was a little bit lower than we thought in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about some of the personnel costs and things there? And sort of how should we think about the operating margin for lab? And then the Covance question, which is the backlog conversion was down to 37% this quarter. I mean you've been averaging in the 40s last year and 39% most of this year. Can you talk about sort of why the backlog conversion is dipping? And sort of like what -- how should we sort of think about that in tune of 2020?","Adam Schechter","Sure. I'll start with how I think about margins, and I'll talk more broadly and then I'll answer the question specifically. As an enterprise, we expect our margins this year to be relatively flat. We're going to see an increase in our margins in Drug Development, albeit maybe a little bit less than what we saw in 2019, and we're going to continue to see the Diagnostic margins. And we expect those to be continued under pressure, and they'll be slightly down in 2020 versus 2019. But net-net, we believe it will be relatively flat this year versus last year with the 2 puts that we have. ","If you look at what we've been able to do, and I'll use the third quarter as the example, I mean PAMA had an impact of 130 basis points and our margin was down 70 basis points. So we were able to make up a good portion of the PAMA impact. As we move into this year, I think we can do a bit better or similarly because of the Launchpad initiatives that we've put in place. And we will continue to push hard on reducing costs where we can in the Diagnostic business. We have a $200 million Launchpad commitment, and we're going to meet that commitment, and then we'll continue to see if there's additional opportunities and ways to even bring down costs further. ","Only other thing I'd say with regard to Covance and backlog, the Covance book of business is doing well, continues to build. And I think that we have a real opportunity moving forward. Quarter-by-quarter, I'd be a little bit careful looking too closely because there is a lot of variability in numbers across the segments. I'd look more towards our yearly guidance, and that's why we give the guidance on a year-long time period.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. Derik, I'd just add to that, maybe first with the backlog question. So a lot of things come into play. Obviously, the business mix that we have, the therapeutic mix, the stage of where the trials are, again, we have kind of the end-to-end business, if you will. Historically, plus or minus, we've been around 40% of backlog conversion. As Adam said, it's good to look at it on a kind of an annual basis because there's fluctuations. So we did see it drop down a little bit to the 37% from the quarter, but again, still in line. But as a general rule, maybe for modeling, if you will, we tend to say around 40% of conversion to revenues in the next 12 months, and that would represent roughly around 85% of the revenues for the next month. So another 15% comes in with, obviously, new business that's transacted during the year. ","On the Diagnostics margin standpoint, Adam really hit it well from the standpoint, while margins were down, again, excluding PAMA, we would have had nice margin appreciation. And in fact, the fourth quarter margins were down the least amount that they were all year, so as Launchpad is kicking in, as the growth of our underlying business is kicking in. And so while we still expect to see margins down next year -- slightly down because of another year of PAMA, we also similarly say we're -- not for PAMA, we'd actually be seeing nice margin appreciation. Our goal is to continue to manage our cost structure to do that. ","When we talk about higher personnel costs, that's kind of our way of every year saying personnel costs are our biggest cost. And so that does increase with normal inflation, and obviously, depending upon the markets that we serve. And so nothing, if you will, unusual about it other than that's just the biggest cost that we have to overcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Erin Wright","On the fundamentals in the CRO business, can you just speak to RFP flow pricing dynamics? Is this a relatively rational pricing environment out there? And could you parse out for us a little bit on the central lab business, in particular? How big that business is for you today? And then what that's growing at? Has it been exceeding your expectations on that front? And then could you also just comment on the direct-to-consumer kind of genetic testing market, kind of where -- what your guidance now implies for that segment?","Adam Schechter","Okay. So I'll start with the genetic testing market. You saw a significant decline in 2019 versus 2018. It's now a very small amount of our total volume and of our total revenue and operating income. So although it may go down again in 2020, it should not have any real significant impact to our fundamentals or financials. ","With regard to our central labs, it's a strength, and we continue to do very well in our central labs. And I think with the acquisitions that we've done and our capabilities in early development in general, including central laboratories, it continues to be a real strength for us, and I don't see that changing over time. ","And then lastly, with regard to the environment, I believe that biotechnology and pharmaceutical is really doing well when it comes to new molecules and new chemical entities and the number of products in development. And the environment itself, I think, feeds well into our ability to continue to grow our Drug Development business. Pricing will always be competitive in every market in health care. I don't see any fundamental shift or trend other than it continues to be a competitive environment, and we can compete very well within that environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair.","Matthew Larew","Adam, I wanted to go back to your comments on the preferred lab network. It seems that both patients and providers will have pretty meaningful incentives over time to move volume into the PLN. Is there anything you can do to proactively work with United or even other payers in terms of accelerating the transition of some of that volume given that it seems that longer term, the incentives for all parties involved are aligned?","Adam Schechter","Yes. So Matt, I agree with you that it's -- rationally, it makes a lot of sense. And the good news is when you have a lab like we have where you have really high-quality and you have a lower-cost price structure, it's something that can actually help reduce overall health care costs. And every part of the health care system in the United States and around the world, frankly, is struggling with health care costs. And I believe that we can be part of the solution with the quality that we bring at the cost that we bring it. We work very closely with United. Obviously, we will continue to work with them. We will do whatever we can within the regulatory legal environment to work with them to make sure that this is successful for both them and for the patients that they and we serve together. So we're glad to work with them, and we'll continue to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.","Stephen Baxter","I wanted to ask about the fourth quarter in the lab business. I appreciate the color you gave on the organic volume and the moving parts there. It looks like when you adjust for those parts and also the capitated contract wins that you had from your largest competitor, it looks like the underlying organic growth is maybe a little bit weaker than the past couple of quarters. I was wondering if there's any specific drivers we should think about for the quarter. And then also how to think about volume seasonality during 2020 given the annualization of managed care network changes and the calendar shift?","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. Stephen, this is Glenn. At least I'll start. I'd say from an organic revenue growth within Diagnostics in the fourth quarter, again, normalizing for the headwinds that we'll go through, we were at the upper end of our expectations, if you will, from the, call it, 2% to 3% normalized organic revenue growth, so consistent as we've had in the full year. ","I think on an earlier question, there was a little bit of a difference in the mix between normalized organic volume versus our revenue per acquisition. But when you look back, again, from what's driving the organic business, we did benefit from an extra day that was timing related to kind of a headwind from days in the first half of the year. But we still had, obviously, the impact from managed care contract changes as well as some lower consumer genetics demand. Similarly, we had the big ones, which was PAMA and the impact of Beacon's contract. So when you net all those out, again, we would say kind of a normalized organic revenue growth in the quarter would have been a little bit north of that 2% to 3% range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Sandler.","William Quirk","So a couple of questions. So first off, how much, if any, of the supply chain for the -- is manufactured in China? And obviously, is there any risk to that given the current situation? And then another one on the PLN. When do you think we might see other payers follow United's lead here? Could we see something happen in 2020? Or do you think they want to actually assess some of the results before they go ahead and roll their own plan out?","Adam Schechter","Sure. Bill, I'll start with the second question. I think that the PLN is going to take a little bit of time to actually show the benefit of the PLN and show that it can actually be executed and implemented well. So I would expect -- although I don't know for certain, but I would expect other managed care organizations to wait to see the impact. And as they start to see early impact, there's a timing where if you don't hit July, it's hard to implement in the next year. So if they don't do it this July, it would probably happen in 2021, and it's too early to tell what the other managed care organizations may or may not do. But what I've built into the plan is no upside to PLN based upon this year. And we've not built anything for other managed care organizations as we look into this year or into the future. ","With regard to the coronavirus, I mean, obviously, we do have some of our supply chain that goes through China. Our team is working to ensure that we have consistent supply. I think we're in good shape as we sit here today. We'll have to watch it closely depending on how long or if it gets worse in China or has a global impact. But if it gets to that point, it would be significant across many different areas within the health care system. And I don't think it would be anything specific to our business or to what we do that is overly concerning. As I sit here today, I don't see an impact. It would only be if something got really worse that's unanticipated at the moment.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Glenn, I just had one follow-up. I wanted to make sure we were setting expectations right for the first quarter on the lab side for earnings because I think you have a couple of headwinds. One is -- obviously, you PAMA, you also have Beacon, and then finally, I think you have an extra wage day. So maybe just talk about kind of the pacing of earnings throughout the year on the lab side. And just any overall commentary on 1Q would be helpful.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. When you think about just the timing and the -- I guess, first, I'd say just overall that the 2 businesses, as you know, have a little bit different seasonality patterns, if you will. So the Drug Development side really strength more so in the second half than first. But similarly, on the Diagnostics side, a stronger first half to second. So it kind of levels off at an enterprise level. And so when you look at our performance overall, especially in -- driving even down to the earnings per share, you can kind of take a look at each quarter relative to the total to get a reasonable proxy of where it will be. ","To your point, within Diagnostics, we do have the issue of an extra day. And again, if you look on our website, you'll notice that we pick up around a half a day benefit on revenue in the first quarter and in the third, that's just how it falls out, while there's the extra payroll day that will be in the first quarter. So as a proxy, a revenue day for us is around $25 million of revenue. And on the cost side for a payroll day, it's around $10 million, if you will. So I think that will give you at least a sense of how -- if you wanted to tweak a little bit for that. ","But to your point, on the Beacon renewal, so obviously, that still has the impact in the first half of the year until it annualizes. Obviously, PAMA is going to stay on for the full year. And then finally, just with the managed care contract changes, again, there'll still be a little bit of a headwind as that annualizes. But it will be through the first quarter, and then the rest of the year will be flat. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of some color into the quarter.","Operator","I was going to just let you know that I didn't see any more questions in the queue.","Adam Schechter","Yes. Thank you very much, Kevin. What I'd like to do is close the call now. First of all, thank you all for joining the call today. As we look ahead, we're well positioned for another year of strong, profitable growth. The work that we do, it matters to customers, it matters to patients around the world every single day. And our ethics, our integrity, our pursuit of scientific excellence are strong and a steadfast foundation for every single thing that we do. We're helping to save and improve lives, and we are poised to play an even greater role in the future by helping solve some of the most pressing global health care issues. So we appreciate your time today, and hope you have a good rest of the day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference Scott Frommer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Scott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's first quarter 2018 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Gary Huff, CEO of LabCorp Diagnostics; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","In addition to our press release, we also furnished Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements with respect to 2018 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on operating and financial results, and the opportunities for future growth.","These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. We are off to an impressive start in 2018, once again demonstrating the power of our integrated growth platform. The combination of accelerating organic revenue growth and drug development, strong organic growth in diagnostics despite headwinds from PAMA and weather, and acquisition contributions from both businesses yielded year-over-year revenue growth of 18%.","This top line performance along with the benefits from our LaunchPad initiative and tax reform translated into adjusted EPS growth of 31%. We expanded margins significantly in Covance and held them for the enterprise. In addition, we fully deployed our free cash flow through share repurchases and a one-time bonus payment to non-bonus-eligible colleagues as a result of tax reform. We are very pleased with our operating performance during the quarter.","Our results reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, ASC 606. Although ASC 606 has no impact on our cash flow, we estimate that it will lower our full year 2018 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.20 to $0.30, which Glenn will discuss in more detail.","I want to stress that we are nevertheless maintaining our full year guidance despite this development because our strong first quarter performance, outlook for the balance of the year and progress on key strategic initiatives give us confidence that we will overcome this impact, which is merely due to the accounting change.","As we said early in the year, to achieve our guidance, we are relentlessly focused on execution of three priorities: driving profitable growth, integrating key acquisitions and optimizing enterprise margins. We are driving profitable growth by capitalizing on strong customer demand for our differentiated capabilities and strategically investing in new offerings for future growth.","In Drug Development, our investments in people, solutions, technology, therapeutic expertise and infrastructure are resonating with our customers. The objective evidence is another quarter of strong net orders and book-to-bill. Independent evidence comes from a survey of biopharma customers conducted by the Life Science Strategy Group and William Blair, in which Covance was recognized as far away the most improved CRO over the past year. As John Ratliff memorably told me last year, quite simply, we are winning in the market.","In Diagnostics, our focus on Women's Health and Medical Drug Monitoring as well as our strategic collaboration with 23andMe contributed to market-leading organic growth. The increased volume helped mitigate the impact from lower reimbursement rates related to PAMA. There are multiple growth opportunities in Diagnostics and we will continue to deploy capital judiciously to maximize the return on our growth investments.","Our second priority for 2018 is integrating key acquisitions flawlessly. The integration of Chiltern is largely complete, benefiting customers of both Chiltern and Covance. We have preserved the high-touch customized experience that Chiltern's biotech and emerging pharma customers require while strengthening both Chiltern and Covance's scale, therapeutic expertise and capabilities. In Diagnostics, we continue to demonstrate the value of our be selective and go deep strategy as partnerships with major health systems such as Mount Sinai and PAML expand to new services and initiatives.","Our third priority in 2018 is optimizing our enterprise margins. Besides profitable revenue growth and acquisition integration, our LaunchPad improvement process initiative in both businesses is critical to achieving this goal. LaunchPad centers on fundamentally reengineering service delivery to improve the customer experience while sustainably enhancing margins.","During the quarter, we opened a Covance central delivery center in Bangalore, India, an important milestone toward expanding our global service delivery model. Global service delivery enhances our proficiencies by standardizing processes and procedures, automating workflows and creating a global platform to reduce expenses and support long-term growth. The impact of Covance LaunchPad is clear in significant Covance margin improvement versus last year.","In addition to focusing on these three 2018 priorities, we are also capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities provided by our powerful combination of leading Diagnostics and Drug Development businesses. At our Investor and Analyst Day in February, we identified three strategic initiatives \u2013 supporting our customers' transition to value-based care, enhancing the drug development process and creating a leading consumer engagement platform.","I will now discuss highlights of these areas during the quarter. We entered into a comprehensive laboratory collaboration with Appalachian Regional Healthcare, an 11-hospital health system in Kentucky and West Virginia. We expanded our relationship with Mount Sinai to consolidate all of their reference work and streamline their inpatient labs. We delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth in companion diagnostics, and Covance's backlog in this area now exceeds $300 million. We continue to offer customers the unique ability to develop companion diagnostics as lab-developed tests or in collaboration with manufacturers as IVDs [In-Vitro Diagnostics].","We are in the process of finalizing an arrangement to offer companion diagnostics globally to meet the requirements of our biopharma customers who wish to sell their medicines outside the United States. We announced a strategic technology agreement with GlaxoSmithKline that covers several Xcellerate modules on a Software-as-a-Service basis including Covance's proprietary risk-based monitoring solution. This software allows sponsors to strategically guide site monitoring resources from trial commencement to completion.","We announced the next step in our LabCorp Walgreens initiative with the opening of 10 patient service centers in Walgreens stores in Florida. Physician and consumer response to the LabCorp Walgreens experience has been outstanding, and we continue to attract new patients to these sites. This quarter, we expect to bring our testing services to consumers' homes through our innovative at-home self-collection testing device. This device will be validated to provide results equivalent to a venous blood draw, assuring LabCorp quality and reliability in another new channel.","LabCorp Express, our differentiated consumer checking kiosk, is now available in more than 600 patient service centers. Feedback on this proprietary tool continues to be extremely positive, and we remain on track to install the capability in all of our patient service centers by year end. We released the LabCorp patient mobile app for download by consumers at various app stores as an additional option to the currently available Patient Portal. These innovations increase consumer engagement, capture more accurate demographic and insurance information, and create efficiencies in patient service center workflow.","In closing, we are off to a terrific start in 2018. Through sharp focus on our key priorities in Diagnostics and Drug Development combined with important strategic accomplishments, we delivered impressive growth and continued to create shareholder value.","We are the world's largest laboratory by revenue and global reach, but we are more than the world's largest laboratory. We are a global leader in life sciences. We offer real solutions beyond lab and beyond CRO, and we provide unique and differentiated value to consumers, physicians, health systems, managed care, and biopharma partners. We could not accomplish these things without the commitment and contributions of nearly 60,000 colleagues around the globe. They dedicate themselves every day to our mission to improve health and improve lives and make all of our current and future successes possible. We are all confident that the future ahead is bright.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Dave. My comments today will focus on the company's first quarter results as well as provide an update on our 2018 guidance. However, I'll start off with a discussion of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, ASC 606, given its impact on our numbers.","On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, meaning that we restated our 2017 financial results to better enable evaluation of our 2018 performance and guidance. In the press release, our prepared remarks, and the Q&A session to follow, all references to our 2017 results are to the restated numbers unless we specifically advise you otherwise. In the back of the press release, we provided tables that include our full-year 2017 results as well as our first quarter 2018 and 2017 results under both ASC 606 and the prior accounting standard, ASC 605. We also provided additional related information on Form 8-K furnished this morning.","As you can see from the tables, the net impact for the enterprise is that the company's full-year 2017 revenues increased by $102 million, or 1%, compared to the prior accounting standard. Our adjusted operating income decreased $56 million or 3% from the prior accounting standard because the inclusion of investigator fees and other pass-through expenses changes the underlying percentage of completion calculation used to recognize revenue. The new accounting standard has the effect of deferring these earnings into future periods. As a result, earnings per share in 2017 decreased $0.35 or 4%. There was no impact on cash flow.","Furthermore, ASC 606 affects our businesses differently. For Diagnostics, the new standard requires us to treat bad debt as a reduction to revenue rather than as an SG&A expense, meaning our revenue is lower but our operating income does not change. Our reported margins therefore are higher. Specifically, as seen in the table in the back of the press release, for the first quarter, revenue under current accounting was lower by $85 million compared to the prior accounting method. There was no change in operating income. And as a result, margins are now 90 basis points higher.","For Drug Development, the new standard requires us to add investigator fees and other pass-through expenses to both revenue and expense. As a result of the increases in both revenue and expense, our reported margins are lower. In addition, these investigator fees and other pass-through expenses, which are tied to our clinical services business, now affect the timing of revenue recognition over the life of the contracts because these expenses tend to be incurred later in the contract life. To be clear, the total earnings of the contracts do not change, only the timing of when they are recognized.","We have reviewed all of the Drug Development business's contracts, more than 800 that are affected by this new standard. For the first quarter, Drug Development revenues under current accounting increased by $196 million compared to the prior accounting method. Operating income decreased by $7 million, resulting in a 300 basis point decline in margin.","Putting it all together, our consolidated revenue in the first quarter increased by $110 million or 4% compared to the prior accounting standard, while our operating income declined by $7 million or 1%, resulting in lower adjusted EPS of $0.05 or 2%.","To wrap up on the accounting discussion, a couple of key points worth noting. First, although the numbers look a bit different, the company's strong operating performance and its improving trends year over year are clear under both accounting methodologies. Second, ASC 606 has no impact on cash flow.","With that, I'll review our first quarter results. Revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, an increase of 18% over last year, as acquisitions added 13.4%, organic revenue increased 3.2%, and we benefited from foreign currency translation of 150 basis points. Operating income for the quarter was $305 million or 10.7% of revenue compared to $318 million or 13.2% last year. During the quarter, we had $68 million of restructuring charges and special items primarily related to acquisition integration and the one-time bonus to non-bonus-eligible employees due to the benefit from tax reform.","Adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges, and special items, was $436 million or 15.3% of revenue compared to $377 million or 15.6% last year. The $59 million increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and savings from our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative, partially offset by lower Medicare reimbursement as a result of the implementation of PAMA [Protecting Access to Medicare Act]. The 30 basis point decline in operating margin was due to the mix impact from acquisitions.","The tax rate for the quarter was 28.6% compared to 30.9% last year. The adjusted tax rate excluding special charges and amortization was 22.9%, down from 31.3% last year. This lower rate was due to the implementation of tax reform in the U.S. We continue to expect the full year 2018 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%, as the first quarter rate of 22.9% came in as expected due to the benefit of stock vesting.","Strong operational performance and the benefit of tax reform translated into net earnings for the quarter of $173 million or $1.67 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which excludes amortization, restructuring charges and other special items, were $2.78 in the quarter, up 31% over last year.","Operating cash flow was $155 million in the quarter compared to $226 million a year ago. The reduction was primarily driven by the one-time bonus payment related to tax reform and higher working capital to support growth, partially offset by higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $73 million or 2.5% of revenue compared to $72 million or 3% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $82 million in the quarter compared to $154 million last year.","During the quarter, we repurchased $75 million of stock. As of March 31, we had $326 million of authorization remaining under our previously approved share repurchase program. On April 24, the board authorized an increase in the company's share repurchase program to a total of $1 billion demonstrating our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders.","Our cash balance as of March 31 was $362 million, up from $317 million at the end of 2017. And total debt was $6.8 billion, unchanged from last quarter. The company's leverage at the end of the quarter remained at 3.3 times gross debt to restated last 12 months' pro forma EBITDA.","Now, I'll review our segment performance beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% over the last year. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by acquisitions, organic volume measured by requisitions and the benefit from currency translation of approximately 30 basis points, partially offset by the negative impact from PAMA.","Revenue per requisition increased 0.7% due to acquisitions, partially offset by the impact from PAMA. Total volume increased 6.9%, of which organic volume was 3% and acquisition volume was 3.9%. In addition, volume growth was negatively impacted by approximately 1% due to adverse weather.","LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $364 million or 20.6% of revenue compared to $342 million or 20.8% last year. The $22 million increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to acquisitions and strong organic revenue growth. In addition, the negative impact from adverse weather was mostly offset by a favorable legal settlement in the quarter. The decline in operating margin was due to the negative impact from PAMA, partially offset by strong revenue growth.","Now, I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 39% over last year due to acquisitions, accelerated organic growth and the benefit from 390 basis points of foreign currency translation. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $108 million or 10% of revenue compared to $68 million or 8.8% last year. The $40 million increase in operating income was due to organic demand, LaunchPad savings and acquisitions. The 120 basis point improvement in margin was primarily driven by organic demand and LaunchPad savings. We remain on track to deliver $150 million of net savings from Covance LaunchPad and $30 million of cost synergies from the integration of Chiltern by the end of 2020.","Drug Development delivered another strong quarter of net orders and net book-to-bill. For the trailing 12 months, net orders were $4.8 billion, translating into a net book-to-bill of 1.29 times. These results compared to trailing 12 months' net orders and net book-to-bill of $4.6 billion and 1.34 times respectively as of December 31, 2017. Backlog at the end of the quarter increased to $9.2 billion, up from $8.7 billion at the end of 2017. And we expect approximately $3.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenues over the next 12 months.","Now, I'll discuss our 2018 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of March 31 for the remainder of the year and includes the impacts from currently anticipated deployment of free cash flow towards acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. And as a reminder, all 2017 results mentioned in the guidance are restated in light of ASC 606. We expect revenue growth of 10% to 12% over 2017 revenue of $10.3 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 90 basis points of currency translation. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 9.5% to 11% due to strong organic growth and favorable currency translation.","We expect LabCorp Diagnostics' revenue growth of 3.5% to 5.5% over 2017 revenue of $6.9 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 20 basis points of currency translation. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 3% to 5% primarily due to strong organic growth.","We expect Covance Drug Development revenue growth of 21% to 25% over 2017 revenue of $3.5 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 230 basis points of currency translation. This is an increase of our prior guidance of 20% to 24% due to favorable currency translation. We remain on track to deliver mid- to high-single-digit organic growth in 2018 across our businesses.","Our adjusted EPS guidance is $11.30 to $11.70, an increase of 22% to 26% over adjusted EPS in 2017 of $9.25. This range is unchanged from our prior guidance. However, it now includes the projected negative impact from ASC 606 for the full year in 2018 of $0.20 to $0.30 per share whereas our prior guidance assumed no EPS impact from the accounting change. We expect to offset this reduction in earnings due to the new accounting standard through our strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year.","We expect free cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, unchanged from prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks, and now we'll take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, good morning, gentlemen. So on the lab side, the volume number really stuck out to me particularly on the organic side, given most of the other results we've seen across kind of healthcare this quarter, it doesn't seem like there was a huge shift in utilization and so it feels like you guys are kind of outperforming there. I know you called out 23andMe, and that's worked well for you. But can you give us just some context for how you've been able to sustain kind of this more elevated rate particularly in the face of some of the weather issues we saw and just how that's sort of likely to trend over the balance of the year just in terms of the rest of the cadence?","Gary M. Huff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure, Ross. Good morning. This is Gary Huff. First of all, we are pleased with the 3% organic volume growth for the quarter despite the weather. This was really driven by strength in Women's Health, 23andMe, as well as our Medical Drug Monitoring. And I will tell you we continue to expect low-single-digit volume growth for the remainder of the year. And one of the reasons why we believe in our growth organically is due to the fact of our organization's focus we started. If you were at the Investor Day, you saw that we had a significant focus on oncology, genetics, Medical Drug Monitoring, as well as Women's Health and 23andMe.","And so the organization is very focused. We have a great commercial organization that is focused. And in addition to that, the entire organization, from our couriers to our phlebotomists, our lab, our people across the organization are focused on profitable \u2013 driving profitable growth in the organization, but also delivering value in terms of high-quality results and solutions to our customers, and that is proving out to do very well for us.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Ross, it's Dave. I would just add, part of it is the integrated sale to the physicians' office, particularly the OB\/GYN and primary care around Women's Health, around genetics, around Sequenom. So I think we have a very comprehensive set of services, and we're offering them in a way that is attractive to the customer and highlights the one-stop shop opportunity that really makes us differentiated.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Excellent. And just on the guide, can you just give us a feel for how you're able to kind of manage through that $0.20 to $0.30 headwind because that's pretty significant relative to what we were first contemplating and tease out a bit where in the P&L you sort of had the confidence that that will sort of carry through for the rest of the year? I mean, obviously, you beat the Q1 number, but you still have quite a bit left to go in the year, and that's a reasonable step-up. And so is it really on the margin side where you've got some flexibility or were there other elements kind of contemplated on capital deployment, et cetera?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Hey, Ross. This is Glenn. To your point that the growth that we experienced in the first quarter organically, margin improvement through our LaunchPad initiative was all coming through. We had a very strong first quarter. As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to see a good outlook, better organic revenue. You saw that we bumped up our guidance, if you will, and revenue within our Diagnostics business. We also did have the benefit of favorable currency in the quarter, and the outlook for the year contributes as well. But overall, we're feeling pretty bullish about our businesses and it's reflected in our guidance.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And Ross, it's Dave again. Just the acquisitions are outperforming our preliminary view of them when we made the acquisitions that applies to PAML, that applies to Chiltern. So those will annualize at some point, but we still feel this underlying performance in the business is very strong and gives us confidence that we'll be able to offset the impact of this accounting change.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Helpful, Dave. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning. Dave, you commented that on a combined basis, you're seeing accelerated growth versus what either company could do on a standalone basis. Is there any way to quantify that? I mean is there contracts that you've won or something that we can look to from our side to better understand that?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Lisa. I think that it sort of sounds like a circular answer, but it's not. I mean I think you just have to look at the results. You look in particular at the progression in Covance of the book-to-bill, the net orders and the backlog. Obviously, a lot of that is due to good leadership, and it's due to strong operational improvement, but it's also due to the LabCorp capabilities that we bring around companion diagnostics. It's due to the LabCorp capabilities that we bring around data and recruitment.","By the same token, you look at the strong LabCorp performance and again the numbers speak for themselves, but underneath that is the Covance capabilities that we bring to health systems with patient recruitment, the Covance capabilities that we bring with access to trials and cutting edge medications, not only in major academic centers but in health systems that have rural delivery \u2013 that deliver services in rural settings where the patients otherwise might not be able to access cutting edge medicines for acute conditions like advanced cancer, and so we bring something that is different and something that is attractive.","So again, I think the numbers are the best reference point, but I also think those numbers would not be achievable without the combination of the two capabilities. And if you look at the performance of peers, you see that our numbers are better, and they're better because of the combination.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So if we think about this, if we look at peers and look at your number, is it fair to say the growth rate that you have that's incremental versus a peer potentially comes from that combination or is it really hard to quantify?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think it's very hard to quantify. Again, we can talk about specific contracts in Covance that we won because of the LabCorp data. We can talk about specific companion diagnostics contracts that we've won in Covance because of the LabCorp capabilities and the dedicated laboratory. But it's going to be hard to put a number on it other than to say I go back to the outperformances for a reason, and it's great people, it's great talent, it's great leadership, but it's also the value of the combined organization and the global scale and reach.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, Glenn, I know you said that the legal settlement helped to offset weather in the quarter. But is there a way to quantify what the legal settlement was, one; and two, what it was for?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I'll take the first part, which is the financial impact. We've talked about it mostly offsetting the adverse impact from weather, and we did quantify that at around 1% impact on volume. So the adverse weather, call it, is around $10 million of operating income. And so we talked about that the legal settlement essentially is at least mostly offsetting it, so it gives you the magnitude or the range of what that number would be as well.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And, Lisa, it's Dave. We can't comment on what the legal settlement is for due to confidentiality. But again, it's one of those things where we incurred some legal liability, and we were able to recoup some of that liability through the settlement.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. So I wanted to focus on Covance. What was organic growth in the quarter? Can you talk about bookings, how they compared to under the prior methodology? And then finally, in early development, are you seeing any new opportunities given consolidation and other factors impacting some of the smaller players?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure, I'll take that, Jack. This is John Ratliff. In terms of book-to-bill and the actual ED and then finally getting into the other part, book-to-bill in the 8-K shows we were in the old methodology at about 1.36 times, and then in terms of now 1.34 times. That's over the last 12 months. Under the new, it was 1.34 times going to 1.29 times. The key here is strong operating performance no matter what view you take. And so that's even with annualizing probably our strongest quarter last year. So significant strength across each of the segments, early development, as well as in the labs as well as the clinical.","As to the revenue, it's consistent with our guidance that we gave for the year in the single-high to mid-digit growth, and so showing actual accelerated growth in all the segments of the business.","And then finally, in terms of the early development business, we're seeing actual real strength in terms of the safety assessment, metabolic lead optimization as well as the chemistry areas, accelerating momentum organically and actually adding capacity in certain areas, as we've actually given visibility to, as an example, the CMC area, but also adding capacity within our present facilities, so seeing the biopharma area, showing the biotech area showing real strength underneath and a significant participant in our backlog.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, John. And then in terms of the data strategy, any updates on how the Walgreens collaboration could benefit Xcellerate and any update on how the check-in tool is impacting patient opt-ins?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Jack, it's Dave. So the check-in tool is being introduced into the Walgreens environment as we move to the next set of stores, and we're optimistic that it will support an increase in opt-ins. We're talking about a number of what we think are very attractive options to expand the things that we're doing with Walgreens beyond just the drawing of blood in the stores. And we'll have more to say about that probably over the next couple of quarters opposed to this morning.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks. Could you speak to any of the nuances in test mix I guess that may have influenced that revenue per requisition? And can you speak to how sustainable that trend is? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Erin, it's Dave. So MDM and Women's Health are probably on average at a slightly higher price point than our average test mix, which would give us a little bit of positive impact. 23andMe, as we've said, is below our average price point. I think it's important to remember, however, that when you think about 23andMe, also think about the fact that we don't do a blood draw, we don't do logistics, we don't do the typical things that we would do in procuring a specimen. So even though it's below our average price point, that is not in any way to suggest that it's not great business for us because it's terrific business. So what you get in the total mix is you get up from Women's Health, up from Medical Drug Monitoring, up from Genetics and Oncology, with some offset from 23andMe. And that's why we mix to the 70 basis points positive.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. And then on the Covance side of the business, if you could, comment on general RFP flow more on the clinical side. And were there any significant cancellations or anomalies that you would call out? Thanks.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. The amount of proposals is consistent with past quarters, very nice proposal flow. And in terms of cancellations, we're within the range that we've seen in the past. There's nothing abnormal about that.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Erin, Dave. Just one more thing, I should also have mentioned. I think it's obvious, but nonetheless I should have mentioned that PAMA has an impact on revenue per requisition this quarter in the year-over-year comparison.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks, maybe just one on the United contract. I know last quarter, you said you were having accelerated conversations with them. I'm just wondering, an update there, any thoughts on timing, how we should be thinking about that one.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Patrick. It's Dave. We continue to be involved extensively and consistently with United. And as soon as we have something to tell you about, we absolutely will tell you about it.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Fair enough. And then just on capital allocation, how are you guys feeling about the M&A pipeline? Do you see more activity on the lab side now that PAMA has been out there for a few months? And how should we be thinking about lab versus CRO for your M&A?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It's Dave again. I would say on the PAMA side, there's certainly activity in the pipeline. There's certainly engagement of a number of parties that are looking at their options. At the same time, we have to recognize that we as LabCorp and the industry through ACLA [American Clinical Laboratory Association] and our industry colleagues have been working very aggressively both within the court system and with the legislative system to try to fix the error that CMS made with PAMA, and so I think there's some watchful waiting in terms of what's going to really happen before we see a strong pickup in activity.","In terms of the allocation of resources, I would just repeat what we have said previously, which is we're fortunate that we generated significant cash flow. We're going to deploy that cash flow judiciously. We look at every deal individually. There's no bias toward the CRO side or the lab side. We look at every deal individually in terms of what is the best deployment of capital, where are we going to achieve the best return. Both of the organizations are in the process of significant integration activity. And obviously, you saw we announced yesterday that we've expanded the partnership with Mount Sinai to do more things with them. So we don't have a bias. We will continue to be active in M&A, and we're going to look at where we can achieve the best return on the dollars we're investing.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I actually had a couple of questions on the CDx side. So I guess, first, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your plans. You mentioned plans to expand globally. Is that with specific partners? And how would we think about where the testing is done, regulatory dynamics? Maybe just some more color there would be helpful.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Amanda, it's Dave. It would be with partner or partners. And it would involve performing the testing outside the U.S., but obviously in environments where we felt comfortable with all the things like quality, reproducibility, laboratory certification. And it would involve in all likelihood sharing of our operating procedures and processes for performing the testing. So as you know, the biopharmaceutical companies see large markets for some of these companion diagnostics outside the United \u2013 or some of the therapeutics outside the United States, and we want to be able to provide the companion diagnostic testing that's associated with.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And it feels like there's momentum shift on the CDx side for various reasons. Obviously, the MCD that was just published by Medicare, but I'm curious how your pharma partners are thinking about it. So you've got some that are maybe focused more on an all-comer-type strategy, some are thinking about it more from a segmented perspective. So just curious how you think about that just in terms of pre-market or clinical trials versus post-market, are your pharma partners interested in pursuing markers more generally at this point just given the pipeline?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I'd say yes to the very last point. We're seeing that extensively through chiefly both on the post-marketing side as well as in really the Phase II up. And so almost every discussion, every partnering discussion we're having that extensive capability review even at the early Phase II timeframe. But clearly we're seeing strength. We believe we're seeing the majority of the market, and that's why you're seeing our backlogs and our order rate go up by a factor of 3 and 4x from the time of the LabCorp acquisition of Covance. So we're seeing it in both areas, both the post-marketing area as well as in the Phase II\/III, and pharma is extensively looking at the biomarker space and the capabilities in terms of the companion diagnostics with respect to the partnering \u2013 strategic partnering of Covance and themselves.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And it's Dave. I'll just add, beyond the dedicated companion diagnostics laboratory and our goal of achieving global delivery, we also have resourced a biomarker center of excellence within Covance to collaborate with pharma partners, and that is supported obviously by all the biomarker where we've historically done at LabCorp. So again, it's just another example of how the combination adds more to our service offerings than either of us would have alone.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is now open.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Dave, I have two quick questions for you. First one, you gave a good detail to Erin on the revenue per requisition increase, but I don't think you guys have stated what the impact of PAMA was this quarter. Could you give us that?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah. This is Glenn. We've talked about that the impact of PAMA for the year was going to be roughly around $70 million, and it is we expected and actually we experienced in the first quarter pretty close to being kind of pro rata. So we expect it to be pretty evenly spread throughout the year.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. That's helpful, Glenn. And then I know we're early in the year still, Dave. And there is typically a wide range of potential outcomes, but free cash flow guidance was maintained at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion despite seeing the strong organic growth. Just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of how the business trends are and is that just your typical conservatism or how should we think about the free cash flow guide?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","While I don't even know what I need to answer the question, you answered it for me. So it's early in the year. The guidance encompasses a wide range of outcomes. I'm not going to comment on my conservatism versus my aggressivism, if that's even a word. But look, it's a very substantial amount of free cash flow. Certainly, there are things that we did in operational performance that make us optimistic about our ability to do better, but it is the end of the first quarter. The guidance does encompass a wide range of outcomes for earnings and obviously that translates into cash. We had said that we're going to make some incremental capital investments this year as part of the benefit of tax reform in the business, so we feel very comfortable maintaining the free cash flow guidance as it was in the quarter.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Sounds good. Thanks, guys.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","The only thing I just add to that. Just, as you know, when you look at the seasonality of our business, our first quarter historically is in the 10% of our total year's cash flow. So we kind of came within that range doing $82 million, again out of a $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion total number. So obviously, as the year unfolds as we generate the bulk of our free cash flow throughout the year, we'll continue to give the updates on where we feel hopeful coming on.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Tyler L. Etten - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning. This is Tyler Etten on for Bill. I was wondering if you could talk about the opportunity with CMS approving next-gen sequencing. We're starting to see some small private payers follow suit. Are you guys viewing this as a coverage trend or maybe a little bit more conservative on that front?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Tyler, it's Dave. I think we've been in the forefront of next-gen sequencing again both on the clinical trial central lab side as well as on the clinical diagnostics side. We do see it as a significant opportunity particularly around our genetic testing. At the same time, private payer coverage remains less than robust at this point. And so we see the CMS coverage decision as probably the beginning of a trend, but we're going to follow the trend carefully and adjust accordingly.","Tyler L. Etten - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thanks. And then do you think that most of the negative weather effect is behind us now that we're at the end of the quarter or should we expect some weather effects in Q2?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I would say forecasting is an art. It's not a science. And I think we'd all agree that the worst forecasters tend to be the weather predictors. But from our perspective, we assume normal weather throughout the rest of the year, which is within the guidance. But as you recall, when we had the third quarter a year ago, we had adverse weather. So barring normal weather, we actually should see a pickup from weather in the third quarter, but obviously things that we don't control, which is why we don't forecast it to be anything other than kind of normalized.","Tyler L. Etten - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is now open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to go to margins. They were down year-over-year, and I think you mentioned mix and acquisitions in the release. Maybe if you could flush that out for us. And more importantly, help frame the opportunity around sort of either margin expansion versus just holding the line or maybe even having margins contract in sort of the years ahead given PAMA?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Ralph, it's Dave. So we have been very clear that Diagnostics margins are going to be down this year as a result of PAMA. And the assumption would be that if PAMA is fully implemented as planned, we'll have margins headwinds in 2019 and 2020 as well. The other side of that is LaunchPad cost reductions, things that we're doing in the core diagnostics business to improve efficiency. Obviously, organic growth helps us to improve those margins as well as the test mix.","On the Covance side, obviously we saw 200-plus basis point improvement in year-over-year margins with the initial steps from LaunchPad. LaunchPad is a three-year program to improve service delivery and sustainably improve margins as well. So for the Diagnostics business, the likelihood is we're going to see pressure on margins. For the Covance business, margins expansion. And for the enterprise \u2013 for the enterprise as a whole, our goal, as we said in our third priority, is to continue to protect them and optimize them over time. I'm sorry. I misspoke. The Covance margins were up 120 basis points as opposed to the 200 that I overoptimistically stated. That will be for John to do next quarter.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. And then I was hoping you could maybe delve a little bit more into the Walgreens expansion. The incremental intent (52:42) is encouraging, but maybe help on what may or may not be potentially prohibiting much faster expansion. Is this something that you want Xcellerate more and Walgreens more reluctant to or the other way around, or is it not that dynamic, sort of not in play? And if there are any exclusivity, remind us around the relationship or could there be sort of \u2013 and if there was sort of interest from other retailers, is that something you could pursue? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. So, on the question of exclusivity, there's exclusivity within the markets, but there's no blanket exclusivity. And so there could be other retail opportunities that we would pursue presumably. In fairness, there could be other lab opportunities that Walgreens might pursue. We have been very pleased with Walgreens as a partner. As I said earlier, we've talked a lot about other opportunities beyond what we're doing with the draw stations, and we expect this partnership to expand both in number of stores and in scope over the balance of 2018 and into the future.","In terms of the number of stores, we want to be selective and careful about the markets. We want to think more broadly now that we're demonstrating the success of the model about how we can use the Walgreens service center locations to change the model of how patients engage with us at our current service centers. So I don't think there's any hesitation on either side to scale the program. What we are doing is being very careful about the way that we roll it out to make sure that, one, we don't damage service levels or reduce qualities because we're trying to expand too fast. Two, we're both very interested in integrating the kiosk check-ins into the broader structure of their pharmacy in our lab, and so that requires some IT work that we're looking at. So there's just a number of reasons, but I would not take it as any hesitation on either side to scale up the project.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks for the comments.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Just a couple of questions on the EPS guidance. First off, Glenn, can you help me better understand what changed as you assess the impact of ASC 606 because I thought that accounting change was already in your prior guidance. And then secondly, the offset that enabled you to maintain EPS guidance despite that headwind, how much of that would you characterize as organic versus other items like the legal settlement or tax coming in lower than we thought? Thank you.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. First, I guess on the EPS and ASC 606 and the guidance. As you saw when we gave our preliminary assessment and when we came out with our guidance, we did give preliminary restated revenue numbers for 2017 and then our growth rates for 2018, which was effectively adding the investigator fees and the other pass-through expenses. And so, as you saw in our change in guidance or the updating of our guidance, none of the growth rates on the revenue side were due to ASC 606. It was due to the strength of organic revenue growth within Diagnostics as well as the change in the currency.","On the earnings side, it's a little bit more challenging. There, while we did a sampling of the contracts that we have, and again, over 800 of them, the impact on the earnings was fairly negligible. We assume that over when we got to all 800 contracts going through the detailed review that they would be offsetting because effectively they were all pass-through. When we did the analysis and updated it, again, for every one of the contracts, what we saw was that, relative to the sample that we used initially, our contracts tended to be earlier stages of completing of the trials. And because the investigator fees and the other pass-through expenses tend to be more weighted towards the middle of the contracts, we were more weighted with earlier-stage contracts. And as a result, they caused our percentage of completion to change where effectively it moved it out a little bit.","So the earnings, and use 2017 as an example, there again we would assume that it would have a nominal impact. It had around a $55 million impact in earnings that will again be pushed out to future periods. And then similarly now in our guidance for 2018, as we roll those contracts forward, we have around, call it, $35 million of reduction in earnings relative to the old accounting standard, so less than the impact in 2017. But again, those earnings will be pushed out in the future as well.","With regard to the offsetting of the $0.20 to $0.30 impact from ASC 606, we talked about the strength of our organic revenues. We've talked about the impact that currency was favorable as well. When we gave our original guidance, at that point, we knew the adverse impact from weather other than there was some still bad weather later in the period, but the bulk of it was early. And we knew about the benefit of the legal settlement that was effectively going to be an offset to that. So relative to the guidance we provided, both of those were kind of muted out. The change really is driven off of the strong performance we had in the first quarter, and again, an improved outlook for the remainder of the year.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups here. When we think about just pricing, outside the United contract and outside PAMA, are there any other factors such as other contracts or renewals, or anything else that we should consider when we think about pricing beyond this year? And I understand that this is the beginning of 2018. But just conceptually, how should we think about the other factors that are either headwinds or tailwinds to price going forward?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Ricky, good morning. It's Dave. So I think you've essentially stated it correctly. The things we need to think about are PAMA. I'm not \u2013 I wouldn't \u2013 obviously, the United contract doesn't have any impact on our 2018 pricing unless and until there's a change in the contract status. The impact of acquisitions and the annualization of acquisitions, so PAML and the price point of PAML probably being higher than our typical in-counter price. And remember, a lot of that is reference work that comes from hospitals. So that annualization will certainly have an impact.","Generally, what I would say is our private pricing has been relatively stable over the last several years, as we've said. We don't see anything that is going to have an immediate impact on that. And so the major impact, as we've said, is mix, which is not unit price and unit pricing relating to PAMA.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the cost-cutting side, I appreciate the comments on margin. But how should we think about the cadence of the cost-cutting throughout the year?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Again, it's Dave. We are not guiding to quarter-by-quarter impact of LaunchPad. I would say, remember that there were some reductions that we did last year that we're getting the full-year impact of this year that will annualize. And then the impact of things like global service delivery, which started in the first quarter, will actually accelerate throughout the year.","So I guess the best way to put it is think about the Covance LaunchPad and the Chiltern synergies as essentially being spread ratably over the three-year period. And then within that period \u2013 within each year, you'll typically see a relatively even distribution subject to some ups and downs.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, thank you. Obviously, 23andMe has seen massive growth from at-home testing with saliva for genetic testing. Dave, can you speak to the impact you think you might have from your at-home blood collection device and maybe speak to some of the test menu that will be available?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. The at-home device is designed to open another channel to consumers and patients. The initial test menu will be probably in the range of about 20 analytes, and will focus on things that are of high interest to consumers like hemoglobin A1c and also to payers.","And there are several ways that we think about why this is important. One, just in conversations with leaders of large payers, one of the things that I'm hearing over and over again is the costliest patients are the patients who are sick at home. They're not engaging with the system. That's why they're showing up in acute crises in the emergency room, and we need to find a better way to reach them.","So you're seeing a lot more activity around home health. You're seeing a lot more activity around home monitoring. And for us, this is a simple way of supporting not only the consumer who wants to know about the status of their health through labs, but also the payer community, including the government payers, in being able to reach patients in the home in a convenient and low-cost manner.","So I'm not going to make an estimate in terms of what is the market opportunity or where is it going to go, but I think it's a really important initiative for us again to open another channel to reach consumers and then to think about is this kit available for sale in the retail setting, is it delivered through a distributor or a wholesaler who has a home business. These are potential further legs of the business as we roll it out.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thanks. And my second question, at the risk of oversimplifying or handicapping the outcome of the ACLA versus HHS case, is it fair to speculate that relief to the 2021 to 2023 is the bull case here in terms of the cuts that could be rendered in those next three years or do you see another alternative that could be even more appealing than that?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I've said all along that, first of all, any time you sue the government, it is an uphill battle. Nevertheless, on the merits \u2013 and they're dense legal papers but I have read them. On the merits, we have a very convincing and powerful case. Congress wrote a statute in which it specifically instructed the Secretary to do something, and that something was do a market survey that included hospitals. The Secretary wrote a rule that excluded over 90% of the hospitals in the United States. So the Secretary didn't do what Congress said. And legally, I believe that means that rule should be set aside, and that is what we're seeking in relief. We're not seeking change in the payment cuts. We're seeking that the rule be set aside and the Secretary be told to go back and do what Congress said to do.","So to me, the right case is the judge rules in our favor, the rule is set aside, the Secretary restarts the process of rulemaking, and we end up with a rule that carries out congressional intent. And that would have the impact of resetting the 2018, 2019, 2020 reductions and coming to a market assessment of the lab industry, which is exactly what Congress asked for the Secretary to do. Congress said to the Secretary get Medicare to market. It didn't say get Medicare to the absolute lowest price on every single test, which seems to be what the Secretary is trying to achieve.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Glenn, just a quick question on tax. So you're maintaining the tax rate at 25%, but with the exclusion of the tax benefit from stock comp, am I right in thinking that your effective baseline tax rate assumption actually went down?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No. We guided \u2013 we assume that we would be roughly 25% on an adjusted basis, and we continue to believe that. The first quarter is always going to \u2013 I shouldn't say always. Obviously, hopefully, we're always seeing our share price appreciation, so we're getting a benefit from the stock-based comp impact on taxes. But we know that when we provide our guidance. So our stock comp, if you will, vests in February in the first quarter, you'll have seen that in the trends that same quarter a year ago that we'll have a lower effective tax rate. And then throughout the year, we do not forecast any more change relative to stock comp. So to the extent that people are exercising shares that we obviously can't forecast, there could be a benefit from that going forward, but we don't model that. So we still feel the 25% is the right number for the year with the first quarter coming in, call it, around 23% and obviously implies that we'll be a little bit above 25% for the remaining three quarters.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And then for John, are you seeing any changes in how your customers are making decisions based on data enablement? And then are there any wins you can call on Xcellerate at this point?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I do think that most of our customers are using data with respect to decisions on patient recruitment strategies, on site selection, on protocol optimization. Now certain therapeutic areas are more applicable to the use of that data, but almost consistently across the board, whether it's our central lab data, whether it's our diagnostics data, they are utilizing that to their benefit in terms of the strategies of the aforementioned three years.","So, specific wins, I think as Dave said, we obviously have over a (1:08:46) quarters and on track to the revenue goals that we had before, but as you know, Brian, those decisions when they're made on \"data\" are also made on the project team, the medics, the capabilities of strategy. It's never just one thing. And so we do look at this as a hugely differentiating factor and the reason why we're winning to the extent we have with the strong book-to-bills of around 1.3 times.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rohan Abrol from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.","Rohan Abrol - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to find out if you're seeing any changes with respect to your full-service versus FSP demand in Covance?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","The program versus FSP, I'm not seeing a swing to one way or another. The greatest thing in terms of the \u2013 or one of the areas that the Chiltern acquisition benefited us greatly on was the capability within the FSP areas, especially around the biometric space and now adding the strength of a legacy Covance in the monitoring space having that now enterprise offering, but we're seeing real strength on the programmatic side as well and across therapeutic areas, the oncology area. And I'd have to say the investments in the talent, team, therapeutic areas, et cetera, that LabCorp Covance have made in the past are assisting with the programmatic wins as well. I'm not seeing a shift one way or another, to answer your question.","Rohan Abrol - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. And then did you guys comment on the amount of project awards associated with access to patient lab data this quarter?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It's Dave. I think as John just said, we exceeded $0.5 billion. We're not updating that number, but you can assume that it continues to grow.","Rohan Abrol - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave King for closing remarks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you very much for joining us this morning. I think what you can gather from this call is that we are intently focused on two things. One is execution. The other is innovation. And our focus on execution and innovation is delivering impressive results, and we're excited that we will be updating you on those results in the quarters to come.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Paul Surdez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Paul Surdez - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and internet. With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Finance Officer; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","In addition to our press release, we also filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and included reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financing results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2015 10-K. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. We reported another solid quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 4.5% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%. We expanded margins at an enterprise level and within LabCorp Diagnostics, an impressive accomplishment in light of lower demand.","We also continued to augment our growth through the deployment of free cash flow to strategic acquisitions. It is our expectation that our strong free cash flow will also enable us to restart our long-standing program of returning capital to shareholders next year. We are steadfast and committed to improve health and improve lives around the globe, led by our focus on our three strategic priorities: delivering world-class diagnostic solutions, bringing innovative medicines to patients faster and developing technology-enabled solutions to change the way care is provided.","I will now update you on our key activities during the quarter and our progress on each of these objectives. First, to be the world's leading provider of diagnostic solutions, we continue to expand our test menu, innovate in science and complement our robust capabilities for key acquisitions.","In the third quarter, we completed the strategic acquisition of Sequenom, and our integration plans are on track. The addition of Sequenom positions us as the market leader in NIPT, women's health and reproductive genetics. We now offer patients and physicians one source for the most complete range of women's health diagnostics, simplifying the customer experience. Non-invasive prenatal testing is an exciting long-term growth opportunity that continues to gain traction with payers, as evidenced by increasing coverage for average-risk pregnancies.","We also see increasing interest from providers, as evidenced by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics updated physicians' statement, which recommends that providers inform all pregnant women that non-invasive prenatal screening is the most sensitive screening option for traditionally-screened aneuploidies.","We are also investing in technology that increases patient and consumer engagement and creates a better experience at LabCorp. Our most recent initiatives include our real-time insurance eligibility capability, which was implemented nationally earlier this year and allows our personnel to determine whether a patient is insured at the time of service. This tool benefits our patients by helping them avoid unexpected coverage denials. In addition, we are testing enhancements to this capability in select locations to provide a pre-service disclosure to patients, itemizing their expected payment responsibility, which will benefit patients by reducing surprises in their bills. Both of these initiatives will also help us reduce bad debt.","As part of our commitment to customer engagement, we also expect to launch our consumer-initiated lab test offering before year-end, giving consumers access to certain lab tests online in an expeditious, compliant and responsible manner. In addition, we expect to launch a mobile-optimized version of our patient portal in early 2017, which will improve the customer experience by enabling patient-friendly functionality, such as scheduling an appointment or paying a bill any time, anywhere, from any mobile device.","Second, to bring innovative medicines to patients faster, we continue to enhance our data capabilities, develop differentiated solutions and expand our therapeutic expertise in critical areas of drug development. Last month, we announced the addition of John Ratliff as the CEO of Covance Drug Development. We are thrilled to have John join us, and he has already engaged the Covance team and many of our key clients. We're excited to have John's experience and vision to further enhance our ability to provide superior drug development services. John is deeply engaged in tactical actions of our clinical business as well as the development of the strategy for the entire Covance portfolio, and we look forward to his contributions to LabCorp in the year to come.","Clients continue to be attracted to the insights extracted from our combined LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development data to optimize clinical trial recruitment. We are focused on effective daily utilization for enhanced patient identification, patient engagement, protocol feasibility and site selection to drive faster recruitment for our clients. Since the acquisition of Covance, our customers have awarded us a dozen studies based on the unique value of LabCorp's data and we continue to use our integrated data capabilities as a point of differentiation.","We are committed to enhancing our therapeutic expertise with a particular focus on the growing areas of oncology and rare and orphan disease. Our combined scientific expertise and experience in these categories is substantial. For example, we worked on all 14 oncology drugs approved by the FDA last year and we are the only company to provide diagnostic support for all three immuno-oncology drugs approved to-date.","In rare and orphan disease, we worked on 20 of the 21 FDA-approved drugs in 2015. Over 80% of rare diseases are genetically defined and we offer clients more than 480 tests in this category, as well as biomarker development, genetic sequencing, specialty testing and market access services, all of which create a clear differentiator for us in the marketplace. We are further strengthening our enterprise-wide sales force to target clients that will benefit from our scientific leadership in these important therapeutic categories.","Our success in combining LabCorp and Covance scientific and operational expertise is particularly apparent in companion diagnostics. Our clients seek scientifically-driven, cost-effective options for companion diagnostic development, and we are delivering. We are currently supporting more than three dozen companion diagnostic programs, a third of which are proprietary programs where we are developing the companion diagnostic for the customer. We look forward to sharing the progress of these programs as they advance through the regulatory process.","We continue to look at all technology platforms for companion diagnostic applications. For example, we are presently conducting studies on the MiSeqDx next-generation sequencing platform, analyzing the collection of genes that represent a potential CDX application. This work is being performed in our industry-leading Covance central lab genomics facility, which has broad experience in NGS technologies and applications and is a qualified sequencing provider for all leading platform manufacturers.","Our market-leading central laboratory capabilities are generating revenue growth opportunities beyond companion diagnostics. For example, Covance's central lab is on pace to win new orders in 2016 that will translate into 150,000 tests for LabCorp's esoteric laboratory network, up from 18,000 tests last year. In one year, this would be a nearly tenfold increase in the number of complex tests awarded from Covance to LabCorp rather than to other laboratories as a result of our successful lab integration efforts.","We also continue to enhance our central laboratory offering through integration with LabCorp's capabilities and complementary partnerships. Clinical trial investigators' enthusiasm for our enhanced offering is evident in the responses of more than 250 investigators worldwide provided in a recently published survey.","Our central lab is rated the most preferred by 60% of surveyed investigators compared to 16% and 11% with the second and third-ranked labs respectively. This was a substantial increase from the 2013 survey, which was the most recent, using the same methodology where Covance was preferred by 47% of investigators compared to 23% for the next-ranked lab. Importantly, 98% of investigators stated that the pharma sponsor selection of a central laboratory impacts the investigators' willingness to work with that sponsor in the future.","For our third objective, we are changing the way care is provided through the use of information and technology-enabled solutions such as BeaconLBS. The BeaconLBS UnitedHealthcare pilot in Florida has demonstrated positive results, including improved quality of care. Compliance with evidence-based guidelines when ordering lab tests has increased by nearly 50% since the initiation of BeaconLBS. The use of in-network labs is also increased, helping UnitedHealthcare members maximize their benefits coverage and reduce out-of-pocket costs.","Following the successful pilot program in Florida, UnitedHealthcare recently announced the program will expand to Texas in 2017, a significant milestone for the BeaconLBS team. In addition, BeaconLBS will enhance the technology by the end of the year to incorporate molecular and genetic test decision support, an area of confusion for many providers and a driver of lab spend overall.","Next year, we expect to introduce additional BeaconLBS functionality for health plans, physicians and consumers, including the potential use of the BeaconLBS platform for applications beyond lab testing such as support for HEDIS and Star ratings. BeaconLBS is an important component of our unique strategic relationship with UnitedHealthcare, and the decision to implement it in an additional market reflects our mutual commitment to the partnership.","Although earnings and cash flow for this quarter are slightly below our aspirations, this is principally due to deliberate actions on our part. Those decisions include exiting certain accounts in diagnostics, acquiring Sequenom and entering into a strategic collaboration in our central labs business. In addition, our cash flow expectations were diminished by increased DSO in the Covance segment, which reflects a broader industry trend. Despite all of this, our earnings guidance is essentially unchanged, we will finish the year with record cash flow, and we remain excited about and confident in the long-term outcome look for our business.","We remain sharply focused on executing our three foundational strategies. The progress we are making positions us as the go-to partner, bringing the critical solutions to address our customers' needs. Our progress on all of these initiatives furthers our mission to improve health and improve lives, something that every one of our 50,000 employees around the globe is committed to everyday. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress.","Now, I will turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2016 guidance.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 4.5% over last year due to organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 50 basis points. Organic revenue growth in the quarter on a constant currency basis was 3.6%.","Gross profit for the quarter was $788 million or 33.2% of revenue compared to $765 million or 33.7% last year. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to price, mix, acquisitions, our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative, and Covance cost synergies, partially offset by unusually high level of rework in the clinical business and personnel costs. The decline in gross margin was due to lower margins in Covance Drug Development.","SG&A for the quarter was $400 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $386 million or 17% last year. Special charges in the quarter were $16 million primarily related to the acquisition of Sequenom and our LaunchPad initiative compared to $5 million a year ago. Excluding special charges, SG&A in the quarter was $384 million or 16.2% of revenue compared to $381 million or 16.8% a year ago. We continue to leverage our SG&A expense well as evidenced by our 60 basis point improvement in the SG&A rate, which was primarily due to continued expense control including our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A dollars would have been down from last year.","During the quarter, we recorded $23 million of restructuring charges primarily due to the closure of redundant facilities and associated severance. These closures include our progress on consolidating our eight main central laboratory facilities to four facilities by the end of 2017 as part of the integration of Covance.","Operating income for the quarter was $324 million or 13.7% of revenue compared to $308 million or 13.6% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $80 million, adjusted operating income was $404 million or 17% of revenue compared to $384 million or 16.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix and our LaunchPad and cost synergy initiatives, partially offset by higher rework in the clinical business and personnel costs.","Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million compared to $56 million in the third of 2015. The increase was due to a $6 million non-recurring expense for the early retirement of debt assumed as parts of the acquisition of Sequenom, partially offset by lower debt balances. The tax rate for the quarter was 31.7% compared to 38.4% last year. Excluding special charges and amortization, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%, down from 35.3% last year.","Two accounting changes impacted the tax rate. First, the early adoption in the third quarter of the new FASB pronouncement relating to tax benefits of stock compensation lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rates by 1%. And second, the reclassification this quarter of certain gross receipts taxes from income tax expense to SG&A expense lowered the GAAP and adjusted tax rate by 0.6%. This reclassification does not impact EPS and has been adjusted for prior periods.","These two accounting changes resulted in a 1.6% improvement in our tax rate for the quarter. In addition, the reversal of expired tax reserves as well as geographic mix of earnings also contributed to the improvement over last year's tax rate. For the year, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 34%, which represents our prior expectation of 35.3%, less the impact from these two accounting changes.","Net earnings for the quarter were $180 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items, adjusted EPS were $2.25 in the quarter, up 9% over $2.07 last year. Our GAAP and adjusted results in the quarter included two special items \u2013 a benefit of $0.02 per diluted share from the adoption of new FASB pronouncement and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from the impairment of an investment in our venture fund. In addition, the company incurred a loss of $0.01 per diluted share during the quarter from the acquisition of Sequenom; however, we continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to results during our first year of ownership.","During the quarter, operating cash flow was $250 million compared to $288 million last year. The decline was primarily due to fees associated with the acquisition of Sequenom and higher working capital requirements including an advanced payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central lab business. Capital expenditures totaled $66 million or 2.8% of revenue, down from $68 million or 3% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $184 million in the quarter compared to $220 million last year.","At quarter end, our cash balance was $568 million, down from $640 at the end of the second quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.2 billion. During the quarter, we invested $253 million in acquisitions and assumed $130 million of Sequenom debt, which was retired in October. The company's leverage at quarter end was 3.3 times gross debt to last 12 months' pro forma EBITDA, unchanged from the second quarter.","Now, I'll review our segment performance. Segment results exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current Report filed today on Form 8-K.","Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.7 billion, an increase of 4.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of price, mix and acquisitions partially offset by organic volume, measured by requisitions, and currency. Revenue per requisition increased 4.2% benefiting from price, mix and acquisitions. In addition, esoteric testing grew at a faster rate than core testing.","Total volume increased 0.3%, with organic volume down 0.3% and acquisition volume up 0.6%. The decline in organic volume is explained by our decision to exit certain low-margin accounts and to discontinue relationships with third-party providers of customer-initiated testing. These decisions accounted for 70 basis points of organic volume decline. Also, as a reminder, we do not include requisitions generated by our hospital lab management agreements in our reported volumes due to the lack of similarity to our core business in terms of both testing frequency and revenue per requisition.","LabCorp Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $342 million or 20.4% of revenue compared to $319 million or 19.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin were primarily due to price, mix, our LaunchPad initiative and acquisitions, partially offset by personnel costs. We remain on track to achieve our LaunchPad savings of $150 million over the three-year period ending in 2017.","Now I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $701 million, an increase of 4.8% over last year. Excluding the impact from approximately 150 basis points of negative currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, which annualizes at the end of October, revenue increased 9.5% over last year. The revenue growth was broad-based across our early development, clinical and central lab businesses.","Adjusted operating income was $96 million or 13.6% of revenue compared to $97 million or 14.5% last year. The decline in operating income and margin were primarily due to the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, an unusually high level of rework in the clinical business, and personnel costs, including investments in CRAs and the sales force to support ongoing growth. This was partially offset by increased demand and cost synergies. We remain on track to deliver cost synergies of $100 million for the three-year period ending in 2017.","Net orders during the quarter were $755 million, down 7% from last year, representing a net book-to-bill for the quarter of 1.08 and a trailing 12-month net book-to-bill of 1.14. Despite the lower than expected book-to-bill ratio, proposals are at a high level. Backlog at the end of quarter was $7.1 billion.","Now I'll update our 2016 guidance, which assumes September 30 foreign exchange rates for the remainder of the year. We expect revenue growth of 10% to 11% after the impact from approximately 60 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 9.5% to 10.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom.","We expect the LabCorp Diagnostics segment to grow 5% to 6% over 2015 after the impact from approximately 30 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of Sequenom.","We expect the Covance Drug Development segment to grow 7.5% to 9% over 2015 pro forma revenue after the impact from approximately 110 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. Excluding the impact from currency and the expiration of the Sanofi site support agreement, we expect net revenue to increase 11.2% to 12.7%.","We expect adjusted EPS of $8.70 to $8.90, which implies a growth rate of 10% to 13% over 2015 versus our prior guidance of $8.60 to $8.95. Our adjusted EPS guidance now includes $0.05 per diluted share of special items consisting of an $0.11 benefit from the adoption of the new FASB pronouncement, $0.04 of dilution from the acquisition of Sequenom and a $0.02 impairment from an investment in our venture funds.","Finally, we expect free cash flow for the year of $840 million to $880 million versus our prior guidance of $900 million to $950 million. This change in our guidance reflects the cash costs associated with the acquisition of Sequenom, an advanced payment we made as part of an exclusive strategic alliance for our central lab business, and an increase in DSOs in Covance Drug Development which reflects a broader industry trend.","This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll be now happy to take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. A couple of follow-up questions. You talked about an unusually high level of rework at Covance during the quarter. Can you elaborate on that a bit? What is that, why does that happen, what do you to address it, et cetera?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","This is John Ratliff, Bill. And so when you look at specific clients, certain projects, in this case, we had a re-monitoring, additional queries and data management, additional workload and project management that was caused by specific areas. And it all comes down to really process and process improvements at the end of the day and enabling price to be gotten for that rework. So when you look at it, very specific clients, very specific projects and a number of different areas that we believe we can improve on in the upcoming quarter.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, you talked about deliberate actions that impacted some of results this quarter, particularly on the lab side moving away from customers, moving away from the consumer initiatives. Can you just talk about why now, what prompted those decisions? That's all.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure, Bill. It's Dave. Good morning. So as we've said, we intend to launch our own consumer-enabled testing service this year, and part of the preparation for that is to discontinue relationships with the existing third-parties that are essentially using our brand and our capabilities to provide consumer-initiated testing. So, that was the first part.","The second part in terms of the low-margin accounts was, every year we look at profitability by account. We look at return by account, we look at trends by account and we had several accounts where we felt that the demands that were being placed on us in terms of workloads and service were significantly above what we felt was the level of return we were getting and so we made the decision to exit those. It's not particular timing in any quarter, it's just part of an organized annual review that we do and so as Glenn said, the combination there accounted for about 70 basis points of volume that we decided we were not going to continue with.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Okay. That's helpful. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Dave, I just want to follow up on that point. If we think about that 70 basis points of volume, if we added that back, it still looks like volume is below where it was trending the last few quarters. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing in the market and I'm just curious around especially high-deductible health plans? Are they having an impact on what you're seeing from quarter to quarter around volumes and would you expect that to pick up in the fourth quarter because of people meeting deductibles?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Lisa, good morning. So if we look at the quarters sequentially this year, we did have the benefit in the second quarter of Easter actually having fallen in the first quarter. So, that gave us \u2013 again from sequential trends, gave us the boost in the second quarter of that that probably was equal to 40 basis points or 50 basis points. So normalizing for that, we would see going from 1 basis point in 2Q to a net of about 50 basis points in 3Q, which certainly is \u2013 it's a downward trend, but it also reflects some seasonality, summer vacation.","Now, all that said, we still aspire to do better in term of volume growth, but to your specific question, yes, high-deductible plans have an impact. Physician visits have an impact. We saw in the IMS data the trend is, physician office visits year-over-year were down 5% in the second quarter, but they were down 10% in the third quarter. Obviously, that has an impact on demand, so it's a combination of factors. People do get through their deductibles as you go into the fourth quarter, which is encouraging.","But I think there is also a lot of uncertainty, and as everybody is reading about the Affordable Care Act plans, there is a lot of pressure on premium cost, there's a lot of pressure on coverage, there's a lot of pressure on providers withdrawing from the plans, withdrawing from the markets. So I wouldn't necessarily say that we have clarity in terms of what's going to happen with fourth quarter volumes aside from what the historical experience has been.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just to that point, when we think about the Affordable Care Act, I think a little over a year ago, you said we saw some benefit, but now we're through that. If we really see because of the rise in premiums that people don't sign up going into next year, could that be a headwind as we go into next year or is there just really not enough to move the needle?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, a couple of things. A lot of the volume benefit we gained from the Affordable Care Act was through Medicaid expansion, so that volume has been pretty persistent since the ACA passed and we didn't see kind of a one-time engagement. On the other hand, what comes through the exchanges, unless there is a fix of some sort to premium increases and plan withdrawals from markets, there certainly is the possibility that you'll have fewer people enrolled in the exchanges next year and that would potentially have an impact on 2017 in terms of a challenge for volume growth.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open?","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, Dave. I guess if I look at your cost cutting program, the pricing trends seem stable if not improving a little bit. I guess I look at your calling out some of lower end accounts, it would just seem to me you're in a better position to do more business with those accounts and still earn a margin based on some of your internal improvement, so how is it possible there are still accounts that are just grinding you lower with the improvement we've seen you make to-date?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, Bob, we always have customers who want more service for less price, and particularly in situations where these are not customers or there is third-party reimbursement involved or they're a direct customers, we have to make decisions at some point that we're not interested in the business at the price that's being demanded or the return that's being offered. So there are always going to be customers who are asking more than what we feel that we can provide being responsible to our investors and our employees. And this quarter, there were a couple of more sizeable ones that obviously had an impact on our reported volumes.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And even with the offsets you're able to generate internally, these guys are still going well below that. I mean where do they get their service then?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I don't know where they get their service, but they're not getting it from us any further. And look, I mean, yes, there are always customers who for whatever reason expect that they're going to be provided rates that we feel are not appropriate.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Sorry, I hate to beat this over the head, but just looking for a little bit more detail in the lab trends. Was the consumer testing the bigger piece of the 70 bps? And I'm just trying to gauge how we should be modeling this next few quarters. When did it occur in the quarter? Did it actually build a little bit into the fourth quarter? And then a third piece to that just with pricing and Sequenom, how much did that add to the rev per req in the quarter?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, I'm going to start with your question about the consumer, and the answer is that the consumer was slightly smaller, I would say, than the accounts that we chose to discontinue service to. In terms of Sequenom and the contribution to revenue per requisition, we don't typically break out the moving parts like that, Jack. So I would just say it was not a huge contributor to revenue per requisition in part because we didn't have it for the full quarter.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just taking a step back, I think there's a few more moving parts than we've grown accustomed to, but overall the results were good and good to see the guidance moving the right way. Could you just help us with visibility into 2017 earnings? Any puts and takes at this point that we should be thinking about relative to where The Street consensus is today?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think it's too early, particularly in the sum of the items that have already been highlighted in the call around coverage, exchanges, ACA premiums. I think it's too early to really have a particularly clear view, Jack. We'll give our guidance as we traditionally do in February with the fourth quarter call. And at that time, we'll be in a position to articulate not only what the guidance is, but sort of what's the underlying rationale behind the guidance.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Aurko in for Amanda. I was wondering if you could perhaps walk us through a bit of the trajectory that you expect from the Sequenom acquisition in terms of not just the revenue per req, but also how you expect it to change its margin profile over time?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Okay. It's Dave. Good morning. So obviously over time, we do not expect Sequenom to be dilutive. We have said that very clearly, and within the first year of ownership, we expect it to be accretive. In terms of how that happens, obviously there are some redundant public company costs, but I want to be clear that it's our intention to keep that laboratory in San Diego open and to actually send more NIPT volume through that laboratory because of its licensure and because of some of the tools that they've developed. At the same time, we know that we can bring some efficiencies to the laboratory just in terms of automation and other tools that we have developed because of our size. So, that's sort of on the expense side.","On the revenue side, we highlighted broader payer acceptance with average-risk pregnancies. We highlighted the American College of Genetics and Genomics physician statement saying this was the most sensitive screening method. I would also highlight to you this is \u2013 Sequenom provides us with a platform that we can continue to expand and offer more testing, and Sequenom rounds out our women's health and reproductive genetics portfolio, so I think there's a very attractive opportunity for top line growth as well as the ability to reduce the expense base, and I would expect Sequenom certainly to be equal to or better than overall company margin by the end of the first year of ownership.","Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. That's helpful and then in term of capital deployment there, is it similar to kinds of targets that we should start to think about in terms of opportunities or was this specific to women's health kind of acquisition?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, we've always said capital deployment was \u2013 traditionally we've thought about pre Covance \u2013 half to acquisitions, half return to shareholders. That continues to be our overall philosophy. We've talked about a 2.5 times target leverage ratio. We've been clear that that is a target. It is not a commandment written on stone and we're going to be flexible about it in the market depending on conditions. And I think the biggest thing to be clear about is that it is our expectation based on as we look at 2017 that we will be able to then return capital to shareholders as part of our use of cash next year.","Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is now open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Still a little bit confusion around the rework on the CRO side. Just hoping to get a little more clarity on that. Did you say it was one client and one project related. And you talked about re-monitoring and process improvement. So did the client come back to you and basically rework on something that you had done that maybe wasn't done correctly and you had to eat the cost for that?","Just trying to basically get a better handle. And then maybe if there's a dollar amount that we can think about. Is this somewhat of a one-time in nature issue? And does it have any impact, do you think, on the relationship with the client going forward? Thank you.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It's specific clients, so it's not just one. But if you look at the number of projects and you look at the number of clients involved, it's not bigger than a bread box. So it's something you can attack in terms of \u2013 it is, to give you at least a little bit on indication, it's unusually high this quarter. It does get into specific re-monitoring at the end of a trial. It gets into specific data management queries for a trial and additional workload in order to push to the end of that trial.","As to the customer satisfaction side, it's interesting in a lot of those cases you are doing the work at the clients' demand. And they get better satisfaction from the finishing of that trial at that requested timeframe, but there's a lot of handholding at the end of the trials and so you're trying to basically meet the deadlines. In this case, the revenue generation from that workload was not in line with the amount of workload that you gave and, thus, the inefficiency that has shown up in the margin itself.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And, Ralph, it's Dave. I just agree with everything John said and would just comment in addition that a couple of these were sizable customers of the clinical business. They're not walking away from the business. We obviously are helping them work through these issues and have every expectation that we'll move forward with a strong relationship with them.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Any dollar amount, though, that we can think about in terms of what the impact was?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No. I don't think there's any way that we can break out specific dollars for you.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We gave you the margin in total in terms of the business, and there's other areas of that margin deterioration. And whether it's increased CRA in terms of the business and the solid growth that's there, or whether it's the sales force increase due to the fact that you're attempting to increase the book-to-bills, there are other impacts in that margin deterioration, but it shows the proactiveness of the business in terms of trying to increase performance.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So you mentioned in the press release that the year-over-year decline in the operating income in Covance, it was due primarily to the expiration of the Sanofi contract. The good news is you'll anniversary the roll-off on October 31.","But I guess in spite of the comments you just made on the rework of a clinical business within that segment, it seems unlikely that we would see another quarter of down operating income in that segment for the fourth quarter and beyond. At least I'm hoping anyway. So I'm just curious if you can give any more color on just confirming that the anniversary of the Sanofi piece should help the EBIT turn back positive year-over-year from here. Thanks.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Steven, this is Glenn. I guess, as you know, we don't guide to segment margins, but we can give you the clarification in your comment. We annualized the Sanofi contract in October. So there's just, call it, one month in that period that that would be a headwind relative to the overall margins.","The other thing we would say is that, as we progress, again, you look at the performance relative to last year, we had a very strong quarter in the fourth quarter last year. But we do expect to see improved performance with that less headwind, so you would expect to see improved results as we move forward through this year.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And just quickly, just curious with some of the changes in leadership for Covance, are there any just preliminary thoughts on any strategy shifts that we could potentially see over the next year or two with the change in leadership? Thanks.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","This is John. And I think if you looked at my top priorities, there'd be like four. One is to clearly drive more and more value to LabCorp-Covance combination, and whether that's through the data from LabCorp within the therapeutic expertise area as an example oncology, or whether it's delivering unique solutions as an example in the companion diagnostics. That would be one.","Number two is really regaining the leadership and the profitable growth in the clinical development, and that's expansion on the therapeutic areas, expanding the geographic and sales presence as well as focusing on some of the process improvements that are needed. We got a great franchise and strong momentum in the central labs in early development, likely use those market-leading assets as more of a differentiator for clinical.","And then finally, as you would expect, it's really focused on the strategy itself, where are you going to compete, how you're going to compete, and differentiating yourself. So a lot of the time, my time in these initial three weeks, now in the fourth week, has been with customers, with our employees, and with our senior leadership. So, give you at least a little bit of the indications of the priorities that I am now taking.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So, guys, it's 10 minutes before the hour and we still have 11 questions or people in the queue who'd like to ask a question. So I really encourage you to ask one question, and I'm also going to encourage you not to ask questions that we have already addressed, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Maybe just a quick one for Glenn. Can you give any more color on the central lab consolidations, where you are on that initiative, in any way to frame up the savings you've realized or what you expect to realize over time? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, this is John. And well on our way, we're consolidating from eight facilities to four facilities and the consolidations will be completed in 2017 \u2013 by the end of 2017. So we've already done two of those main consolidations and have the actions or are in process on the other two.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Just with that, as we said on the synergies and the integration, towards the latter part of this year and most of next year would be the final pieces of the cost reduction initiative, which the central lab consolidation will be the biggest piece of that and we're on track.","Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's fair. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. I just wanted to highlight the BeaconLBS opportunity in Texas. I know you talked about a little bit in the prepared remarks, but just wanted to kind of remind us, how much that benefited you guys in Florida? Is Florida and Texas a similar sized state for you? Just any sort of color as we think about that ramping as a good guide to growth acceleration on volumes in 2017 and 2018? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning. It's Dave. So we don't count BeaconLBS toward volume. It shows up in revenue and it was a nice contributor to 2016 revenue, the Florida piece. My recollection \u2013 Glenn's looking up the number, my recollection is that the run rate was probably in the...","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","For the full year -","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","About $80 million. Yeah, $80 million top-line revenue. Now, remember, the profitability of that, because a lot of this pass-through is below company margins, but when implemented in Texas in 2017 for the portion of the year that it's implemented, it will certainly contribute to top-line revenue. And we've seen the business achieve better profitability over the course of the Florida pilot, partly because of enhancement, partly because of the MR integrations. And so as we continue to enhance it with new capabilities, we feel that it will continue to be more beneficial to the bottom line and also give us the opportunity to expand to more markets.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. I'll leave it at that.","Operator","And our next question come from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. It's Luke on for Ross. I guess on the Covance side and talking about the bookings, can you guys talk about the specific demand dynamics you were seeing from small biotech to your larger strategics, and across the two businesses, the early development and the clinical business?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. This is John again. We don't break out the bookings by segment, but I'll try to give you a little bit of color. In terms of the biotech side, we actually have seen strength out of the biotech. If you look at our early development areas, very strong in a very stable pricing to even increasing pricing activities. When I look at biotechs across the portfolio, you can look at this, I know people are focused on the biotech spend rates, et cetera. We see that pretty stable, especially based on the NMEs in the past. And then what's that's looking to the future as well as we're probably oriented to the top 50. Over 80% is in that top 50. I look at that as also an opportunity on the other side to get more and more share of that biotech side.","When you look across the portfolio and the performance there, the early development and central labs had and continue their strong momentum. And then finally on the clinical side, we got more work to do and while potentially weaker than the other two areas, we do see impressive actual proposals right now, and now we need to go off and win those.","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. So two quick ones. On the exiting unprofitable accounts, will there be a sequential impact in 4Q volume from that? And then secondly, Dave, you talked about ongoing improvements to the recruitment efforts and the combined LabCorp into Covance. I know you guys are working on a few pieces of that to streamline it for the patients. Any update there? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Bill. So you can assume that the accounts that we walked away from, that until they annualize, that that will continue to be a drag on organic volume, so you'll see it continue through 4Q.","And in terms of patient recruitment, I mean we are continuing to work to broaden the database to refine our ability to interrogate the database. We continue to sign patients up through the patient portals who are volunteering to be re-contacted. We actually had a situation recently where we went back and re-contacted them. And although we did not find any patients who fit for the study criteria because the study criteria was very, very tight, nonetheless of the patients who we re-contacted, there was, I think, all but two or three of the email addresses will continue to be valid that they had given us. So 98%, 99% of the email addresses continue to be valid.","And the patients expressed appreciation that they've been contacted even though they didn't fit the study criteria. So we're just going to keep getting better at this and it's going to keep differentiating us from what our competitors can do.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So two follow-up questions here. First of all, in BeaconLBS, Dave, when we step back and you think about Beacon as a strategic asset, your contract with United is coming up, I think, at the end of 2018. Does this Beacon help improve stickiness with United and is there an expansion plan, right? So you had Florida, Texas is next. Is there a plan to expand to other states?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Ricky. So, yes, I think Beacon is an important component of the strategic relationship with United. It's a tool that we invented basically to address what we perceived to be a need in the marketplace for two things \u2013 better decision support around selection of high-value testing as well as better ability for payers to manage the trend in high-value testing, and so the fact that United has made the decision that they want to expand to another market, the fact that we're developing capabilities from molecular testing and want to develop capabilities, they enhance not only test selection but also they're using the platform for HEDIS and Star ratings. I think these are all things, and obviously with the support of United, I think these are all things that speak to the importance of this tool and the value that's placed on in the relationship, and yes, obviously once we do the Texas implementation, we'll be looking to expand to other markets as well.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the book-to-bill, again it is the lowest in the last two years. When do you expect to return to more for historical levels. I understand that there are a lot of RFPs out there, but based on this book-to-bill, it doesn't seem that you're winning it. So again, is this kind of like a one-time quarter phenomena, and next quarter we're back to more of a steady state or is there something that you think you need to address internally?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Ricky, I think obviously it's very hard to guide to book-to-bill, so what I would say is remember that our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is still 1.14, which is quite healthy.","Second of all, the book-to-bill is a combination of three businesses. And so the book-to-bill rates were different in different parts of the business. Obviously, we want to do better in clinical wins. And as John mentioned, that's a critical part of the strategy. But I can't give you a prediction on \u2013 as you've seen, there's fluctuation from quarter to quarter, and it's stronger in one quarter than in the next. And we're going to be working to improve it.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of R. J. Rice (sic) [A. J. Rice] (1:00:43) with UBS. Your line is now open.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Hello, everyone. It's A. J. Rice actually. Anyway, on the other aspect of the deal that was signed with United Optum was, you're leading competitor told me a lot about getting some enhanced help on the revenue cycle management. I want to throw out and see what your thoughts about there? Is there any opportunities to LabCorp to perhaps look at something that might help you there?","And then just a real quick follow-up on the comment in the prepared remarks about deploying capital next year, getting back on track with the returning capital to shareholders. Is the idea that you think after the first year you'll be back to that 50-50 or is that something that will happen more gradually over the course of next year?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","So I'll take the second one first. I mean I think the idea and obviously it's \u2013 we're still framing it as we look at what we're going to have next year and what's on our targeted list, but the idea is that we would resume the 50-50 split fairly quickly. It's not kind of a we'll start a little bit and dribble about, it's we're going to return capital to shareholders and we're going to think about it in the way we historically have.","In terms of the outsourcing of the revenue cycle management, obviously we have a lot of respect for the people at Optum. They do terrific work. We have been investing in our revenue cycle management capabilities literally since 1997, 1998, when we started consolidating billing systems and standardizing. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think a lot of the things that have been referenced as potential opportunities between our competitor and Optum, we're already doing \u2013 we're already doing real-time eligibility verification. We're already doing transparency to patient on what they're going to pay. We're already doing collections at the point of service. So we're going to continue to \u2013 and we use some outside tools for that, make no mistake. It's not kind of everything has to be invented here syndrome.","But \u2013 so we'll continue to look at what people can bring to complement our capabilities, but fundamentally I just want to be clear that we view that direct engagement and relationship with the patient as a very important part of our business. And so we're not going to be of a mind that we should turn that over to anyone else to manage for us. We're always looking for tools that enhance our capabilities, but that's a core competency, and as we've said over and over again, consumer engagement and that relationship with the consumer for both the LabCorp and the Covance business brings us a tremendous amount of value.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys. Thank you. Wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation. Dave, you mentioned in the call here a couple of times the focus on returning cash to shareholders in 2017. At the same time, you guys have been active in the last couple of year with M&A. So could you maybe help frame for us the extent to which there is additional M&A still on the radar here? I know it's probably unfair to never say never, but curious if it's a reasonable assumption that larger M&A is unlikely next year?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I just think it's difficult, Isaac, given all of the changes in the marketplace and all of the fairly dramatic things that are going on in both businesses to rule anything out or rule anything in. So it's our intention to return capital to shareholders. It's our intention to be active in M&A and I don't really think we have anymore to say about it.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understand. I know that's not an easy question. One follow-up, and I'm sorry to belabor it, the book-to-bill dynamic in Covance, can you just maybe frame for us a little bit because you said that parts of the business were stronger than others. Was there any area where book-to-bill was below 1 time and I appreciate that of course all of this is sort of difficult to handicap quarter-to-quarter, but just want to get a sense of the magnitude of pressure that we might be seeing at least in 3Q?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We're not going to break out book-to-bill by business. We report by segment. We don't report by individual business. And I think we've said what we can say about it, which is there were some parts that were strong, there were some parts that were not so strong and our aspiration is always to do better.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Your line is new open.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The two reasons you gave for the reduction in the free cash flow guidance was the industry increase in DSOs at Covance and then a strategic payment at the central lab. Was one of those materially bigger than the other and can you give us some more color into the increase in the DSOs because it doesn't look like that was something that you were expecting.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. Gary, this is Glenn. I mean just as a proxy, it's fair to say that they're all in the same ballpark of numbers, and again as we said, we made the strategic investment on the Sequenom side and obviously a little bit dilutive in the first year, plus the fees associated with it, the strategic investment in the global specimen solutions business as well.","But with regard to the DSOs, we have seen a pickup, if you will, in the DSOs with customers looking to push out terms, looking to push out milestones for collection. We had expected that we would see that improve as the year unfolded, which we have not yet and that's why we've adjusted our guidance to reflect that. What we can tell you is that there are significant programs underway within the business to continue to drive an improvement in our DSOs, and we would expect that to improve over time, but this year, given the pressures and given what we've seen, we're not going to see that improvement that we had expected.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is now open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sorry. Just a quick follow-up. Just I guess any updated thoughts on PAMA and the OIG report that suggested perhaps rates would go up for certain codes and maybe even the pushback from the government sort of on that front. Just general thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks, Dave?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. Well, obviously the study is underway. We received some sub-regulatory guidance on this. Data reporting quite frankly has some inconsistencies with the rule and some gaps. And ACLA and others have advised CMS of some of the things that we view as being inconsistent with the rule.","There was the OIG report indicating as we and the industry all knew that there were some codes that were being paid below the amounts that Medicare had set and so there would be some increases there. If anything, I would say the clarity is fuzzier than it was before in terms of how the data is going to be collected, who it's going to be submitted from, how it's going to be analyzed, and what the puts and takes will be. So we're going to continue to work collaboratively with CMS. In fairness, they've been quite open to hearing about our concerns and we'll update you when we have good solid information about what we think the impact of PAMA will be on us.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

With me today are, Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jay Boyle, Chief Executive Officer of LabCorp Diagnostics; Joe Herring, Chief Executive Officer of Covance Drug Development, and Deborah Keller, incoming CEO of Covance Drug Development.","In addition to our press release we also filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the investor relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set-forth in detail in our 2014 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","Dave King","Thank you, Paul and good morning. We had an outstanding quarter in which we delivered impressive top line growth as well as record revenue, earnings and cash flow. We began to see the power of the combined businesses, which extends far beyond merely combining central lab capabilities. Our results demonstrate the soundness of our decision to acquire Covance and create the world\u2019s leading healthcare diagnostics company, and strengthen our conviction in our ability to create long-term value for patients, customers and shareholders through integrated lab testing, our global drug development capabilities, and technology enabled solutions. Overall I am very pleased with our execution and our results in the quarter.","Each of our businesses performed well. LabCorp Diagnostics reported another exceptional quarter. We continue to drive strong revenue growth led by increased organic volume. During the quarter, we observed solid growth in both esoteric and core testing, and revenue per requisition was positive for the first time in over two years. LabCorp Diagnostics\u2019 strong top line growth converted into attractive profit growth. Adjusted operating income excluding amortization of nearly $350 million, or 22% of net revenue, translated to 130 basis points year-on-year margin improvement. This increase in profitability was driven by strong volume growth and improved productivity founded on Project LaunchPad. Through LaunchPad we continue to progress with multiple initiatives to re-engineer our company to deliver the highest quality services in the most efficient manner. ","Covance Drug Development reported revenue growth on a constant currency basis of 1.8% over last year\u2019s pro forma revenue. Early development had strong growth and margin expansion as the toxicology market continues to improve. Central labs revenue increased nicely on a sequential basis due to higher kit receipts as we predicted on our first quarter call. Central labs also contributed strong new orders in the quarter.","Clinical business net orders were lower than expected, which combined with slower than typical revenue conversion resulted in growth below our expectations. We are focused on restoring growth in this important service line and expect to see results from these efforts in future quarters. Looking ahead, we see multiple drivers of future profitable growth. First the trajectory of our central labs business is encouraging. We had very strong levels of [Indiscernible] kit shipments throughout the quarter and our average kit receipts over the last two months have increased.","Second, we are encouraged by positive momentum in the early development business fuelled by continuing strength in biotech funding levels. Third, we will benefit over time from investing in growing the clinical business. Fourth, we continue to capture cost synergies from our acquisition.","Now I would like to comment on our progress with the development of new business models that leverage our combined capabilities. The integration of our businesses continues to go well. I am enthusiastic about the coordinated efforts of our sales force and scientific leadership teams. We have dedicated teams focused on driving more than $300 million in incremental annual revenue by 2018 through accelerated clinical trial enrolment, end-to-end capabilities in companion diagnostics and broad use of real world evidence in support of clinical trials.","Our clinical team is featuring the utility of our patient database as a competitive differentiator to enhance patient enrolment, and this initiative has generated a consistently positive response from our clients. Furthermore, we are deploying our differentiated offering to win business. Earlier this month, we were awarded a life cycle management Phase 3b study for uncommon chronically ill patients that present a difficult population to recruit.","Using diagnosis codes in our patient database we obtained unique insights that allowed us to identify eligible patients and their treating physicians, which gave our client confidence in our ability to timely enroll the study. We will next be contracting treating physicians to recruit patients that meet the selection criteria for this important trial.","In addition, our joint analytics team is responding to multiple client requests to use de-identified patient data for commercial purposes, usually in combination with other datasets. Examples include market sizing, comparative effectiveness, deploying a personalized approach to therapy administration, assessing safety signals and identifying opportunities to improve patient [entry].","Through the interest generated from our combination we have expanded conversations with existing clients and initiated dialogue with new potential clients. We also continue to speak with drug sponsors that expressed interest in consolidating R&D outsourcing from multiple vendors across multiple areas of development to a preferred partner to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of bringing a new drug to market.","We see a growing awareness that we can deliver unique solutions that will further validate our decision to deploy capital through this highly strategic combination. Finally, we continue to develop and commercialize technology enabled solutions that use data to enhance decision making, provide scalable platforms and applications for our customers and change the way care is delivered. We have long been committed to helping achieve better patient outcomes at lower cost and we have two services in flight towards that end, Beacon LBS and Enlighten Health.","Beacon LBS is an innovative technology enabled solution that is modernizing delivery and laboratory services. Beacon LBS connects physicians will evidence-based clinical guidelines during the ordering process, providing physicians with access to rich clinical content within existing workflows.","The application promotes use of the appropriate test for the appropriate patient at the appropriate time to enhance the delivery of optimal care. Last quarter the Beacon LBS team achieved its goal of full implementation and this quarter Beacon LBS contributed 1.1% to our organic revenue growth. I congratulate the entire Beacon LBS team on achieving an outcome that was little more than a dream when they began work on this project some five years ago. The Beacon LBS team remains engaged in discussions with existing and prospective clients that are expanding Beacon LBS\u2019 utilization and we look forward to providing updates in the future.","Enlighten Health is utilizing the combined company\u2019s informatics and analytics tools to develop customer solutions and partnerships, such as data integration and data visualization applications. This business is implementing our data strategy and allows us to capture the value of our database and technological skills.","To close, I am profoundly grateful to our 48,000 employees around the globe for their efforts during this quarter as well as to their leadership. We have asked a great deal of our people on multiple fronts and they have responded with energy and enthusiasm. Most of all, they have delivered impressive results and I\u2019m proud of each of them and proud to have the honor of leading this great team.","As the world\u2019s leading healthcare diagnostics company we are well positioned to drive profitable growth and create long-term patient, customer and shareholder value by delivering world-class diagnostics, bringing innovative new drugs to market and using data to change the way care is delivered.","Now I will turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our consolidated second quarter results followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments and conclude with an update on our 2015 guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 46% over last year. The acquisition of Covance contributed $621 million during the quarter, driving 41% year-over-year revenue growth with the other 5% primarily due to strong organic volumes across both core and esoteric testing, Beacon LBS and tuck-in acquisitions partially offset by currency.","Gross profit for the quarter was $775 million or 34.9% of revenue compared to $569 million or 37.5% last year. The increase in gross profit dollars was due primarily to the acquisition of Covance, as well as organic volume and productivity. The decline in gross margin was due to the mix impact from Covance.","Excluding Covance gross margin would have been 38.2%, an increase of 70 basis points over last year. SG&A for the quarter was $392 million or 17.7% of revenue compared to $298 million or 19.6% last year. Excluding special charges of $9 million related to the acquisition of Covance and Project LaunchPad, SG&A in the quarter was $384 million or 17.3% of revenue, a 200 basis point reduction versus last year\u2019s adjusted SG&A.","The increase in SG&A was primarily due to Covance and personnel costs, partially offset by Project LaunchPad savings. The favorable reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue benefited from Covance and the reduction in our bad debt rate. Excluding Covance and special charges, SG&A as a percentage of revenue would have been 19%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year. During the quarter, we recorded $23 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily relating to facility closures, severance, Project LaunchPad, and the acquisition of Covance. Amortization expense for the quarter was $47 million, up from $22 million a year ago due to the impact of acquisitions.","Operating income for the quarter was $321 million or 14.5% of revenue compared to $247 million or 16.3% last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and special items of $70 million adjusted operating income was $391 million or 17.6% of revenue compared to $275 million or 18.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income is primarily due to the Covance acquisition, organic volume growth and productivity, partially offset by currency. Excluding the mix impact from Covance, the adjusted operating margin would have been 19.2%, an increase of 100 basis points over last year.","Interest expense for the quarter was $58 million compared to $26 million last year. The increase was due to higher debt balances following the acquisition of Covance. The expense lower than last year\u2019s 39.1% rate driven by the mix impact of Covance, the tax rate for the quarter was higher than our expected rate of 35%, as we had a greater percentage of our earnings generated in the US. For the remainder of the year, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 36%.","As a result, net earnings for the quarter were $168 million or $1.64 per diluted share compared to $141 million or $1.64 per diluted share last year. Excluding amortization, restructuring and other special items adjusted EPS were $2.09 in the quarter, up 14% from $1.84 last year. During the quarter operating cash flow was $397 million compared to $207 million last year, with the increase due to the acquisition of Covance, as well as improved earnings and working capital.","Capital expenditures totaled $69 million compared to $48 million last year due to Covance. As a result free cash flow was $328 million compared to $159 million last year. At quarter-end our cash balance was $619 million compared to $446 million at the end of the first quarter. Total debt was approximately $6.8 billion. Our liquidity was approximately $1.6 billion consisting of cash and available credit. During the quarter, we invested $62 million in acquisitions and paid down $145 million of debt, reducing the company\u2019s leverage to 3.6 times net debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA. ","Now I will review our segment performance. For comparative purposes, segment results are presented on a pro forma basis for all periods, as of the acquisition of Covance closed on January 1, 2014 and exclude amortization, restructuring, special items and unallocated corporate expenses. Reconciliations of segment results to historically reported results are included in today's press release and the current report filed today on Form 8-K.","In addition, during the quarter we substantially completed our fair market value adjustments in accordance with purchase price accounting associated with the acquisition of Covance. This resulted in reduced depreciation expense of approximately $5 million in the quarter. We expect to complete our fair market value adjustments related to the acquisition by the end of the year. ","Now I'll review the performance of LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 5.4% over last year. The increase in revenue was the result of strong organic volume, measured by requisitions, Beacon LBS, and tuck-in acquisitions, partially offset by currency. The increase in revenue of 5.4% includes the benefit from Beacon LBS of 1.1% and an unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.7%.Total volume measured by requisitions increased by 4.7% of which organic volume was 4.3% and acquisition volume was 0.4%. Revenue per requisition increased by 0.2%.","LabCorp Diagnostics\u2019 adjusted operating income for the quarter was $347 million or 22% of revenue compared to $309 million or 20.7% last year. The increase was primarily due to strong volume growth and productivity. Improvement in productivity was driven in part by Project LaunchPad, which delivered approximately $15 million in savings in the quarter. We remain on-track to deliver approximately $50 million of LaunchPad savings in 2015.","Now I'll discuss the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $644 million, a decrease of 2.7% from last year. The strengthening US dollar negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 450 basis points. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 1.8% over last year due to volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable mix. The business experienced broad-based volume growth led by early development. We saw sequential improvement in the central lab business, but demand was lower than expected in our clinical business. ","Adjusted operating income was $90 million or 14% of revenue compared to $85 million or 12.8% last year. The increase in profit and margin was primarily due to increased volume, lower depreciation expense, and cost synergies of approximately $10 million, partially offset by currency and mix. We are on track to deliver cost synergies in 2015 of approximately $35 million.","Net orders during the quarter were $737 million, representing a net book-to-bill of 1.15, while backlog at quarter-end was $6.6 billion. ","Now I'll update our 2015 guidance. We expect revenue growth of 40% to 42% inclusive of Covance as of February 19th after the impact of approximately 190 basis points of negative currency. We've assumed that foreign exchange rates stay at June 30, 2015 levels for the remainder of the year. We expect LabCorp Diagnostics to grow 3.5% to 5.5% in 2015, after the impact of approximately 70 basis points of negative currency. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 3% to 5%, primarily due to better-than-expected organic growth as well as the additional revenue from tuck-in acquisitions.","We expect a change in Covance Drug Development net revenue to be in a range of minus 1.5% to 5% versus full year 2014 after the impact of approximately 320 basis points of negative currency. This is a decrease from our previous range of 0% to 2%. The lower guidance for Covance reflects lower-than-expected revenue conversion and orders in the clinical business, partially offset by 120 basis point improvement in currency.","We expect 2015 adjusted EPS of $7.75 to $8 compared to prior guidance of $7.55 to $7.90. the increase in our guidance reflect strong second quarter performance and outlook for the year, as well as lower depreciation expense of approximately $0.10 per share due to purchase price accounting that was updated during the quarter.","We expect operating cash flow in 2015 to be $990 million to $1.015 billion versus our prior guidance of $1.045 to $1.07 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to be $270 million to $295 million versus prior guidance of $325 million to $350 million. As a result, free cash flow remains unchanged from our prior guidance of $695 million to $745 million. Excluding net non-recurring acquisition items of approximately $120 million, we expect free cash flow of $815 million to $865 million unchanged from our prior guidance.","Now I will turn the call back over to Dave before we take questions.","Dave King","Thank you Glenn. At this time I would like to comment on our announcement this morning that Joe Herring will retire at the end of this month and that Deborah Keller will succeed Joe as Chief Executive Officer of Covance. First I would like to thank Joe for his leadership, which helped make Covance the respected drug development organization that it is today, as well as the critical role he played during the merger and integration.","During Joe\u2019s tenure as CEO he successfully steered Covance through periods of strong growth and volatility. He led the expansion of Covance\u2019s drug development offerings and the informatics capabilities and he remained steadfast in his dedication to the core principles of Covance, people, process, clients and science. I have great personal respect for Joe and I thank him for his many contributions to Covance. We all wish Joe well in his planned retirement.","I am very pleased that Deb has accepted our offer to succeed Joe. Deb has been with Covance for 25 years, most recently serving as Executive Vice President and Group President of Covance R&D Laboratories, where she led an organization of more than 6000 employees at 18 facilities across the globe that generated nearly two thirds of Covance\u2019s revenue. She\u2019s a terrific leader who is well respected by our employees and clients with a clear commitment to bringing innovative new medicines to patients.","Deb is absolutely the right candidate for this important role, and she distinguished herself during our succession process, in which we considered both internal and external candidates. Given the strong working relationship that Deb and I have developed I am confident that the leadership transition will be seamless. ","This concludes our formal remarks and we are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby of Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert Willoughby","Thank you. Dave or Glenn, why the change in how you are thinking about the volume numbers, I see you break out the BeaconLBS, if I were a Florida United member left the sample prior to Beacon versus now is there a different revenue model here that why you call this out separately?","Dave King","Bob good morning it\u2019s Dave. So the revenue model for BeaconLBS is that there is a payment who are all lab services that are delivered in the market to BeaconLBS some of that lab services will go through LabCorp some of that will go through the other network labs. The reason that we broke out 1.1% contribution is that is the revenue that BeaconLBS received that essentially as pass through to other network participants whereas the revenue the BeaconLBS receives that is take the LabCorp is reported in the diagnostics volume. So as we included essentially the pass through revenue in the -- in our volume numbers it would have given you with distorted perspective on either volume or price wherever we put it and that\u2019s why you see it separately.","Robert Willoughby","I got you, I got you that makes a lot of sense then. Just in [indiscernible] deal pipeline I see you are back to doing talk in so you can comment on the kinds of plans you are working out in the large sector and possibly outside the lab sector?","Dave King","Yes, so in the lab sector that the pipeline is very robust we are looking at wide variety of potential acquisition opportunities always thinking it\u2019s -- as we\u2019ve said many times about broadening the esoteric testing menu broadening our geographic footprint and anything else would be important from a strategic perspective. On the Covance side we are looking at a variety of potential acquisitions that could either complement some of the existing businesses, support continued data innovation efforts or otherwise round out the capabilities that we have and that we are committed to continuing to invest to grow.","Robert Willoughby","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of Evercore your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny","Good morning guys.","Dave King","Good morning.","Michael Cherny","So first Glenn for you quick question just and clarify the moving pieces on the guidance, I heard you talk about that performance in the quarter and also the adjustment on the depreciation line, by my math if you leave the looks like your expectations for tax rate as well as [indiscernible] the implied share count, I want to just -- can you please confirm those two numbers?","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes, the share count should still be the -- roughly called 100 million shares outstanding for the year or so no change there. The tax rate we did have an estimate out before of around 35% we moved it up to around 36% consistent with what we saw in the second quarter and that was just based upon a mix of geographic earnings if you will little higher tax rate in the U.S. So those were the only changes there. And then for the guidance obviously we\u2019ve taken it up we\u2019ve also narrowed it even with the six months left to go so that the midpoint if you will of our guidance is now around $0.15 higher than what we would have shared in our prior guidance due to that performance we have in the quarter our outlook for the year as well as the benefit that we get for lower depreciation expense with -- doing our purchase priced account.","Michael Cherny","Now appreciate that you are just get to the earnings power and then I guess Dave and maybe Joe, Deborah if you want to pine you obviously I think relative to your expectations you\u2019ve -- are hoping the clinical business perform a little better you talked about focusing on this scenario to reestablish growth, can you maybe talk about some of the specific focuses that you are putting in place to ensure that you can get a better close and some of those wins and get the order rate at the level that you would prefer?","Dave King","Yes, Michael thanks for the question. First let me say that from an overall order perspective central labs in the first six months of 2015 have all time record orders as you think about the two companies coming together where there is integration and an overlap at central labs and the clients are pouring volume in and kids going out of the door and kids coming back in or even starting to pick up during seasonally saw summer months which is, is how that business generally closed and early development which has been a business that we\u2019ve been trying to restore those two it was actually the fact just going to be part of the portfolio, we have margin expansion and even during the most recent weeks and months which is seasonally saw orders are very strong.","Joe Herring","Clinical on the other hand had orders ramping to the end of last year but in the first six months of this year orders were softer and the backlog conversion has not been as fast as we would have hoped. One area where we think we can definitely improve it\u2019s in the small and midsize clients we\u2019ve recognized that early in the year we have added a dozen sales people and in fact in the second quarter proposals in Phase 2, 3 clinical were actually up a little more than 25% sequentially. So the actions we are taking are already making an impact at least some proposals and hopefully that flows through as to orders and eventually as revenue.","The other item is that we have been very aggressively [indiscernible] Dave around the globe and introducing him to our clients, CEOs Head of R&D and the person with the longest relationship whether it\u2019s me or Dave or a few other folks have been introducing Dave and he has played very, very well, our clients are not accustomed to see and someone who has a database with 17 million patients technology like the BeaconLBS we talked about to bring both to drug development, investigator site selection, patient identification, as well as new tools on the informatics side that we have been working on that Dave is totally up to speed on.","So I guess my final comment there Michael is did the Phase 2, 3 clinical market is very strong I think you will see as our competitors continue to release results, the success that our clients are having in their pipeline as of late it\u2019s a healthy market that we are serving and frankly the combination of Covance and LabCorp bring a tremendous set of tools that will enable us to win and in the recent industry surveys not ours but ones done by so called analyst clients repeatedly say they are actually more willing to work with Covance post merger than before because of similar things that I mentioned. So, we are working on it.","Michael Cherny","Great appreciate the color and Joe good luck on your retirement.","Joe Herring","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JP Morgan, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Lisa Gill","Hi, thanks very much and good morning. Joe just a follow up on that, can you maybe just [indiscernible] industry for a month time to just understand your comment around orders sharpening and inflow conversion isn\u2019t the market more competitive do you just -- did you expect this to come in overtime how should we think about that?","Joe Herring","Yes Lisa thank you for your question, I mean \u2013 give you what maybe sort of the new answered answer but we have a number of large clients who just happen to have portfolios that are a little bit slower as we go right now. For example, in central labs, we have a number of so source clients who plays every stick of their central labs work with us and every year for the last seven years we\u2019ve had a different largest client and it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve lost work or gain work it\u2019s more competitive it\u2019s just how the pipeline flows and we have a couple of clients who are spending a tremendous amount in the launches and a little less in Phase 2, 3 clinical but they have a strong early clinical pipeline that will bring new volume hopefully in the coming quarters and into next year. So it\u2019s sort of the vague reason of how former pipelines go and just been little bit softer for us but again I think the effort in small to mid clients as well as the differentiating tools that we are bringing position us to do well there and again the market is strong.","Dave King","And Lisa it\u2019s Dave just add a little color to that when we talk about slower than typical revenue conversion this has to deal with the complexity of studies the fact that there maybe other modality such as imaging included in the study that has to be coordinated and patient visit. So it's not that \u2013 it's not that the studies aren't starting, it's just that they are taking longer from the placing of the order to the actual beginning of completion of recruitment, beginning of patient visits and that's \u2013 I think that's characteristics across all of the clinical businesses that comparable that we are seeing in the market.","Lisa Gill","And so based on what we saw on the first and second quarter Dave or Glenn can you just talk about that the updated guidance around Covance and how conservative you feel that is as we move towards the back half of the year?","Glenn Eisenberg","Sure Lisa. Obviously, while we have taken down the revenue guidance of Covance Drug Development it's still a growth rate I think in the midpoint on constant currency we are still up around 2.7%. As Joe spoke to I believe earlier we have really seen good growth in early development and the central labs and that remains unchanged where we saw the lower expectations for growth was really in the clinical business and again we talked about it or Dave just mentioned that the slower than expected revenue conversion as well as little bit softer on the order side, however, we feel pretty good about the outlook that we have now in part because that one part of the business that generated the lower than expected revenues the new orders that were getting now effectively are going to impact 2016 and beyond.","So we do expect and the year what's embedded in our outlook is growth across all the main business lines of Covance year-over-year all be it currently a little bit lower than what we had originally envisioned. I guess on the positive side while we have seen a reduction in the revenue outlook and in the enterprise our top line revenue outlook continues to be roughly where it was actually it's up slightly because of the tuck-in acquisitions and as you saw we have also \u2013 obviously also taken up the leverage as we moved up the earnings per share guidance as well.","Lisa Gill","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jack Meehan","Hi, thanks and good morning. I just want to start and ask about the genomic testing in the quarter and how much of a contributor that was the better pricing and then just any areas of the growth that you could highlight there?","Jay Boyle","Jack, this is Jay Boyle. Thank you for the question. We have seen growth in both the genomics and esoteric business that has helped drive our revenue per session for the quarter that we are really pleased with. We expect that to continue as we move into the back half of the year. And hope to continue to see that kind of growth and did you ask the second question I am sorry I missed it.","Jack Meehan","Yes, just maybe any areas that you could highlight within that or if you thought it was more broad based across the portfolio there?","Jay Boyle","Yes, you hit the narrow and ahead we have had \u2013 we are very pleased with obviously our volume growth and across both the core and the esoteric businesses and we expect that outlook continuing. I do really missed this point in that mentioning that our team has done a terrific job, this is the best of several quarters where we have had significant organic volume growth and volume growth across the board and it is in the esoteric genomic and also in the core area and has helped to give us the price that we have experienced this quarter.","Jack Meehan","Yes, great and then just as a last one on the commentary around M&A just with tuck-in deals there are any different thoughts around the way you think about leverage through your end and then just whether any of this was being driven by some of the regulatory and certainty out there. Thanks.","Dave King","Jack, it's Dave. Good morning. I am not sure what's driving the pipeline and it would be hard to give any kind of reasonable speculation. I will say in terms of our focus and perspective we continue to be focused on the same basic priorities as I mentioned which is the esoteric test menu and this strategic footprint and other potential strategic opportunities [indiscernible]. In terms of the leverage we have not changed our perspective which is we need to de-lever. We paid debts this quarter but at the same time we did a couple of tuck-ins because they were attractive opportunities and you can expect to see the same from us going forward while for paying more debts and we are doing tuck-in acquisitions. We will continue to de-lever and as Glenn said in his prepared comments that debt to EBITDA was 3.6 in the quarter so we have already started de-levering from where we were post close.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Isaac Ro","Good morning guys. Thank you. Dave I wanted to ask another question on Covance if I may, if we look back 90 days ago when you last offered guidance for the year and updated your views on the business, can you walk us through sort of what your assumptions were then and what changed during the quarter because I think in context to your comments around the revenue conversion and the complexity of studies but some more later items I would assume that there were lot of the studies who were working on you knew that they were going to be flat, so I am trying to figure out what led to sort of this [revised] due of 90 days later.","Dave King","Isaac, its Dave. Obviously, it's the time that we updated the Covance revenue guidance. We thought that we had very good visibility in the second half of the year. I would say we did have very good visibility in the second half of the year in early development and in central labs. In the clinical business, certain parts of the clinical business, the orders burn relatively quickly and we came up little short there from what we thought that we were going to accomplish in the quarter, which has an impact for the balance of the year and that's the reason why we've adjusted the guidance.","Obviously, from my perspective and for the management team perspective, we're happy about it, but we have made the commitment as Joe said for even earlier in the year to invest in the growth of the clinical business and to take the steps necessary to put it back on track.","Isaac Ro","Great. And if we just sort of think about your guidance for this year at this point in second quarter, is it fair to say that your outlook is perhaps more conservative for the year than it would have been 90 days ago? Thank you.","Dave King","No. I don\u2019t think so at all. I think it was $0.15 raised in the low-end of which greater than 10 is the depreciation but the rest is due to be in our fourth projected forecast for the rest of the year. Signals there, we feel that the rest of the year is going to be strong. Obviously, as we have said on many occasions, the guidance encompasses a wide range of outcomes but I wouldn\u2019t describe it as either more conservative or more aggressive than what we've previously head out.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes. Keep in mind, Isaac, that the Covance business is a little more volatile than and less predictable than the historic lab core businesses. But in the second quarter we delivered sequential revenue growth of 20 million, call it, and sequential operating margin of nearly 20 million. So, better than expected. So, we'll fight on from here.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Gary Lieberman","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe on the clinical lab business, your organic volume growth was substantially stronger than some of your competitors. Do you think you're taking share or is something else going on?","Jay Boyle","Yes, Gary, this is Jay. Hard to determine whether we're actually taking share or not, but certainly our results speaks for themselves. It's as I mentioned earlier, it's across the board and they talked about the coordinated effort earlier. It's a credit to our sales leadership and then leadership in our divisions, where they're just totally focused on growth. We have a terrific hospital and manage care team that bring deals onboard which pave the way. So we're really pleased about the share that we are capturing.","Dave King","And Gary, this is Dave. Quick follow-up on that. Obviously, we've talked about the fact that we've won a couple of contracts last year. Those are -- had started to annualize and will fully annualize in the next quarter. So again I think the organic volume growth is very strong. You can reach your own conclusions about taking share but we're continuing to see strong organic volume growth through the beginning of the annualization of the business wins.","Gary Lieberman","Okay. And then maybe just any updated thoughts on the PAMA study and what you're thinking at this point?","Dave King","I think the only thing I can do is refer you to the comments that more cards being made at the CMS clinical lab meeting with respect to the timing. I emphasize again as I said I think on the last call, this is a very complex task for CMS. There are a lot of data points, there is a lot of information that they're trying to gather. They're trying to do it in a responsible way that's fair to the industry and also to the payer. We continue to be optimistic about the outcome and to take a -- we hope a positive and supportive approach to what CMS is trying to do.","Gary Lieberman","But any -- have your thoughts changed on the timing. Do you still expect or do you think it gets pushed off for years on?","Dave King","Well, I think they've said the timing of the rule is uncertain and so what we can do is go by what they said which is the timing of the rule is uncertain and it will be up to them to determine what that means with respect to implementation.","Gary Lieberman","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi. Thank you and good morning. First question is around lab volume. Dave, last quarter I think you sounded a little bit more cautious and just volume trend in second half due to these contracts that are annualizing. Today, you guys grace second half revenue expectations for the diagnostic business. So, when you think about what is done today, what has changed, what is adding to your confidence and what are the dockets that are driving this bit of outlook for the second half?","Glenn Eisenberg","Hi, Ricky. This is Glenn. Maybe, at least I can start just a kind of level set that. One obviously, we have been consistently generating good volume. And as Dave commented the annualization of the revenue from the new contracts, really, you'll see in the second half of the year. So, we've benefitted in the first half. The other thing that will benefit in the second half obviously will be the tuck-in acquisitions that we have been doing as well as the BeaconLBS. That will be on for a full half versus the ACLA partial part of the first half of this year. So, consistent, still strong, good volume growth, but again tougher comps year-over-year when you just take it back to the basic organic diagnostics business.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And Dave, do you have any additional comments on that or should I move on to my Covance questions?","Dave King","No. I think Glenn has summarized it well. Volume has been strong. We have BeaconLBS contributing to revenue, which again is part of the overall volume perspective. I don\u2019t think a whole lot has changed in the outlook, Ricky. I think as you get further end of the year you have greater visibility and where you're going to come out. And as we get greater visibility into where we come out, we adjust the expectations accordingly.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. Then on the Covance side. Obviously, you were hearing that early stage is doing better. Lilly contract is a big part I think of that segment. So, can you just help us think through that contract, if I'm not mistaken it was a 10-year contract. So, can you just confirm the term of this contract, when she will be thinking about the end date and what percent of the revenues and what type of trends are we seeing from that business?","Joe Herring","Yes. Ricky, it\u2019s Joe. I think you're talking about the Lilly agreement and that goes through 2019. The agreement continues to perform well and above the expectations and that's clearly in account that we've had Dave in. It's in really good shape. I think if you just take a step back, the fact that early development continues to see mid-to-higher single-digit revenue growth margin expansion capacity filling as well as our competitors doing well. And biotech funding is very constructive to the story. Obviously, central labs is the largest division of Covance and it's the most profitable.","To see record orders and kits out and kits coming in sort of building up tail wins for later in the year and certainly for 2016, is very encouraging. So, Dave who led the recovery of early development, now has the whole enchilada and of course the great business that is central lab has been her baby. So, she can't wait to get her teeth into clinical as well as her arms around the whole thing and bring her years and years of experience to the company, fully to bear.","Ricky Goldwasser","So, Joe, given kind of like the mix that you're seeing in central lab, do you feel comfortable with potential opportunity to even increase margin on that segment because I noticed in the past we thought that maybe we've seen very nice margin expansion where tap it. So, given what you are seeing now coming through, are you more bullish on the margin opportunity there?","Joe Herring","Well let me say this, in my 18 and half years with the company, I have proven one thing for sure and that is that I cannot forecast central lab. Over the longer period of the time, it grows roughly 10%. I am very, very confident that we are in the early stages of accelerated growth in central labs. Our competitive position has improved. I think some -- we got a couple of competitors that are struggling. I think our clients like the incremental benefit of having the esoteric volume from lab core within the portfolio. And as you pointed out Ricky, there is good drop through on additional central lab volume. So, I think as we look towards the end of the year and in 2016, central lab is very constructive and I guess I would say Covance is stronger than ever in central lab.","Dave King","And Ricky, it's Dave. Just one additional comment there what Joe touched on as we add more genomic and esoteric capabilities to the Covance central lab business and particularly as we see great client interest in next gen sequencing exome capabilities that the lab core or central lab business is bringing that will have a natural positive effect on both pricing mix and margin in the central lab business.","Joe Herring","Finally, Ricky, we did add another self-source central lab client in the second quarter as well, which, as they ramp-up will be helpful.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Amanda Murphy","Hi, good morning. I had a couple more on Covance if I may? Joe and Dave I think another at your row today had talked about the strong RFP growth that I am wondering in another you've made an improvement. They know its knocking on that wall since last second quarter but have you seen any change there over the past few weeks and also did you talk about cancellation made at all from last quarter?","Joe Herring","Well, I guess proposal volume being up 25% sequentially is a very good factoid. It's early in the quarter to talk about what will translate into orders but we are much more out there and have better coverage. So, in terms of cancellation rates in clinical, keep in mind we were reporting net orders and so they are net of cancellations and we tend to just color cancellations. They were lower than historical run-rate in the first quarter and sort of at the historical run-rate in the second quarter.","Amanda Murphy","Okay, got it. And then I guess it's the longer term question, so you've obviously provided some revenue synergy target at a high level and then you also talked about to your point the RFP, flow, etcetera. So, just thinking about how we should be tracking your progress going forward, is there a certain book-to-bill number that you would consider to be a successful number going forward and to over what timeframe should we be looking for that that is in context of all the demand commentary that you laid out so far?","Dave King","Amanda, its Dave. I don't think it would be reasonable to point to one specific number and say that's a target or that's a goal or that represents success. I think what we'll be able to do over time is point to as we have specific instances of winning business due to the combination of the companion diagnostics in particular which we are very enthusiastic about and tell you how much that's contributed against the $300 million target. So, I think those will be better indicators to look for than one single number like the book-to-bill or a revenue growth rate.","Unidentified Company Representative","I would though, Amanda, remind you that during the really busy time of the acquisition of Covance, we posted two consecutive record order quarters; fourth quarter was an all-time record, the first quarter was an all-time record. In the second quarter we had a couple of large clinical studies that we expected to win that pushed out the second quarter into the third quarter. So, we had a book-to-bill of 1.15, which is respectable. It's not the record that we had in Q3 and Q4. But, also keep in mind that roughly a third of our revenue is in the pre-clinical area where a book-to-bill of 1.0 to 1 is sort of which target. So, 1.15 for us compared to a predominately clinical company, we translate into something much more like maybe 1.25 to 1. So, good orders, not as great as they were the last two quarters but we are out there fighting.","Amanda Murphy","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is open, please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hello everybody. I guess prior to the merger from the Covance side, I think it was publicly discussed that Sanofi was restructuring it's -- planning to restructure its partnership with Covance. I haven't heard a lot of discussion about that since the merger. Can you just update us, is that restructuring still likely to happen later this year and how would that impact the back half guidance or next year's guidance, is that reflected in there?","Dave King","Yes, thanks for the question. First of all, all of this is in our [S4 dial] filings and it's in all the forecast that we've talked about. There's two parts. The larger part of the agreement at a -- and that is the services agreement, Sanofi volume with Covance's 5x prior to what we had before we did the agreement.","The asset agreement were for the two specific sites and our continued expectations is that agreement will not be renewed but every day is sort of something new. That's about roughly about $70 million a year, but again all of that's fully disclosed. It's in all of our forecast and in all the expectations.","A.J. Rice","Okay, and that's presumably in the guidance that the consolidated companies are offering out as well.","Dave King","Yes.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes, it is.","A.J. Rice","Okay. Then just on the lab side, maybe just Dave or anyone else want to comment. It's been on the news lately the idea of consumers being able to drive their own test. There's been changes in Arizona to allow at least some consumer making the decision to ask for test directly I don't know if I've ever heard you guys express a view on that. You guys have a position on whether you're supportive of that or not and what you think the implications would be?","Dave King","A. J., its Dave. We agree in the first instance that consumer engagement is extremely important in their own responsibility for healthcare and for years we pushed. When I came to this company and most states it was illegal for consumers to get their own lab results without getting permission from their doctor. We push for years and finally AJ just responded with the regulation to allow that.","So, consumer engagement is extremely important. We do need to think about the consequences of consumer self-ordering, one of which is the patient doesn't understand the test result. Two, is the patient decides to start self-treating now that they've got the lab test result. So, we've said and we've been open about, we will have a direct consumer business under the lab core brand by the end of the year. We are not going to do it in a way that disintermediates positions, we are going to do it in a responsible and a compliant way.","And we are very sensitive to the importance of physician interpretation of [test] as well as the need to combine individual test results with other signs and symptoms of disease. So, I think we've been clear in that position and again we continue to support consumer engagement but in a responsible and compliant and measured way.","A.J. Rice","Okay. Alright. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Francis of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Dave Francis","Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. Just real quick though with Joe leaving the company, Dave, I was wondering if as you guys get deeper into the integration process for the business is if there is any other contemplated changes to the leadership team or otherwise on either side of the business? Thanks.","Dave King","Obviously, we've had some leadership transition at Covance, already all of which was planned as part of the merger synergies. We feel like we've got a strong leadership team in place. Deb was going to be a terrific leader. I am sure overtime that she will want to make some tweaks to her team as every CEO does, but there is nothing planned in terms of major leadership or major structural changes.","Dave Francis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Whit Mayo","Hey, thanks. I think you guys called out 15 million of synergies with Covance. Was that all realized in the second quarter or is that a year-to-date number?","Glenn Eisenberg","That was realized in the second quarter, at current run rate.","Whit Mayo","Okay, great. Did you realize any in the first quarter or is it fairly immaterial at that point?","Glenn Eisenberg","This is on the -- I guess, on the Covance side we did around five in the first quarter, call it 10 in the second and again with the target this year of 35. So, obviously, we are delivering solidly on our expectations but the longer term over the three years on a cost savings standpoint, it was going to be call it a 100 million and again we are on track for that.","Whit Mayo","Yes, got it. And my last question, Dave, I think I have heard you say in your prepared remarks that Covance is having a number of conversations with various former customers about some preferred partner relationship or something along those lines. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on that and is that something that's actually new?","Dave King","Well, the conversations of that for why the relationships are not new. I think what's new is the range of capabilities that we bring to the table. Now Covance has always had the unique position in the drug development business of having the combination of early clinical and central lab. But I think that the lab core capabilities, the incremental lab capabilities, the data, the companion diagnostics expertise that compliments with Covance has and obviously the scale and infrastructure for some of the priorities around real world evidence, these are very, very interesting to our clients.","Glenn and I have in fact done several clients visits over the past two weeks and there is a new level of interest about -- first of all I want to understand the rationale for the merger, then I want to understand how can that lead to a broader scientific collaboration, how can that lead to broader capabilities collaboration, how can that lead to execution of some of their priorities. And so, we're enthusiastic about the opportunity to grow some of these existing relationships and add some new ones.","Whit Mayo","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer period. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Dave King","Thank you very much. We appreciate your time this morning and wish you a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great -- rest of your day."],"13443":["Laboratory of America Holdings (NYSE:LH) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 19, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","David P.

My name is Janine, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed.","David P. King","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today from LabCorp are Brad Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Steve Anderson, Vice President, Investor Relations.","This morning, we will discuss our first quarter 2013 financial results, reaffirm our 2013 guidance, highlight our progress on our Five Pillar Strategy and provide answers to several frequently asked questions.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Anderson, who has a few comments before we begin.","Stephen Anderson","Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via the telephone and Internet. Please refer to today's press release for replay information.","This morning, the company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information.","Additionally, we refer you to today's press release, which is available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS, adjusted EPS excluding amortization, free cash flow and adjusted operating income.","I would also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the company's financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2012 10-K and subsequent filings. The company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now Brad Hayes will review our financial results.","William B. Hayes","Thank you, Steve. On today's call I will review 4 key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. I will also reaffirm our 2013 guidance.","First, cash flow. Our cash flow remains strong. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2013, was $661.2 million. DSO at the end of March was 50 days, an increase of 2 days year-over-year.","During the quarter, our bad debt remained 4.3%.","Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 1.2% year-over-year in the first quarter. On a per-day basis, revenue increased 2.9% year-over-year. During the quarter, total company volume increased 1.1% or 2.7% on a per-day basis. We estimate that inclement weather reduced volume growth by approximately 50 basis points during the quarter, and that excluding weather, organic volume was flat year-over-year. Revenue per requisition increased 20 basis points year-over-year.","Third, margin. For the first quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 18.7% compared to 19.9% in the first quarter of 2012. The year-over-year margin decline was primarily due to the impact from weather, Medicare payment reductions and the number of days in the quarter.","Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of March, we had cash of $185.8 million and $30 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion credit facility. During the first quarter, we repurchased $113.9 million of stock, representing 1.3 million shares. At the end of March, $954.1 million of repurchase authorization remained under our share repurchase program.","This morning, we reaffirmed our 2013 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of approximately 2% to 3%; adjusted EPS excluding amortization of $6.85 to $7.15, which includes a negative impact of approximately $0.35 due to Medicare payment reductions and which excludes the impact of any share repurchase activity after March 31, 2013; operating cash flow of approximately $870 million to $900 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $200 million to $220 million. Our capital expenditure guidance is higher than historical levels due to near-term investments in facility consolidation and replacement of a major testing platform.","I will now turn the call over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Brad. We are pleased with our performance given the health care services utilization environment.","During the first quarter of 2013, we grew revenue approximately 3% on a per-day basis and we grew volume 2.7% on a per-day basis. We generated strong operating cash flow of $198.2 million. We generated free cash flow of $156.5 million, which we invested in the business and returned to shareholders through the repurchase of $114 million of our stock, representing 1.3 million shares. And we continue to take keep a tight lid on expenses.","We continue to make progress on each aspect of our Five Pillar Strategy. The first pillar of our strategy is that we deploy capital to investments that enhance our business and return capital to shareholders. The integration of MEDTOX continues to go well and has exceeded our expectations. This acquisition provides us with an excellent opportunity to diversify our payor and testing mix, and we remain excited about the opportunity to grow MEDTOX's specialized toxicology testing.","Last quarter, we announced a target leverage ratio of 2.5x debt to EBITDA, which all other things being equal, we intend to achieve over time. We expect to continue to deploy our capital toward acquisitions and share repurchase. Over the last several years, we have deployed our free cash flow almost evenly between acquisitions and share repurchase. Going forward, we would expect to deploy our free cash flow similarly, and in the absence of sizable acquisition opportunities, we anticipate deploying our additional leverage towards share repurchase.","The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. Our Beacon Patient Portal is now available to all patients in right-to-know states, and we continue to see accelerated growth in patient registrations, adding more than 1,000 new registrations per day. The Patient Portal is a valuable tool that allows patients to better manage their health care, and we will continue to add valuable content and information to the Patient Portal over time.","Our electronic medical record connectivity continues to expand, and we are on pace to exceed last year's record number of new client EMR interfaces. We remain committed to our open platform strategy, allowing our customers to connect seamlessly to LabCorp directly or via the EMR of their choice.","We continue to pilot a number of new population health analytics modules that provide health care business intelligence tools to hospitals, physician practices and ACOs. These tools assist customers in their compliance and reporting requirements with respect to efficient management of their productivity, quality and patient outcome metrics. These industry-leading, data-driven services position LabCorp as a trusted partner to health care stakeholders, providing the knowledge to optimize decision-making, improve health outcomes and reduce treatment costs.","Looking ahead, we will continue to add new analytic offerings at the point of lab order and during result delivery to enhance the physician experience and improve patient care.","The third pillar of our strategy is to continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. During the first quarter, we continued the ramp-up of our Propel robotic technology in our primary Burlington lab. This pilot program is nearing completion and our initial results have exceeded expectations from a throughput and quality perspective. We expect this technology to replace much of the manual splitting and sorting process throughout our major laboratories, enhancing efficiency, turnaround time and quality. We are finalizing our implementation plans for the balance of 2013, and we look forward to providing updates on this initiative over the next several quarters.","We are constantly monitoring and evaluating our supply chain operations, and we are focused on laboratory consolidation initiatives. We will begin these projects during the second half of 2013 and we anticipate deriving ongoing savings from consolidation activity. We will also roll out a new chemistry platform later this year.","This platform has enhanced software capabilities that will increase throughput capacity and lower supply costs in our chemistry testing. We expect the full implementation to take 18 months. Finally, we continue to review and rationalize all components of our cost structure.","The fourth pillar of our strategy is to continue scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We introduce new tests and collaborate with leading companies and academic institutions to provide our physicians and patients with the most scientifically advanced testing in our industry.","Last May, we announced our collaborative relationship with Ariosa to offer the Harmony Test. Harmony is an innovative, noninvasive test for detection of common fetal trisomies. It is based on the sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal blood. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recently noted this innovative technology allows patients the option of noninvasive fetal aneuploidy screening and that the analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal circulation for fetal aneuploidy screening is likely the first of major steps toward the eventual application of whole fetal genome, whole fetal exome sequencing.","We share this view and are pleased with our Harmony volumes, which indicate strong support from this test among physicians. Further, we are encouraged by the favorable coverage policies issued on Harmony by our key managed care partners.","Monogram Biosciences, a LabCorp specialty testing company, recently began offering the GenoSure PRIme assay, the first assay to provide a comprehensive assessment of drug resistance for the most widely used antiretroviral drug classes. GenoSure PRIme specifically complies with the DHHS treatment guidelines issued last month that strongly recommend the inclusion of integrase inhibitor resistance testing in cases of treatment failure and in cases of newly identified infections where there is concern that an integrase inhibitor-resistant strain may have been transmitted.","During the first quarter, we also announced our expanded services for inflammatory bowel disease. Gastrointestinal tract disorders are often presented with nonspecific symptoms and are difficult to diagnose, especially in primary care settings. We launched an expanded IBD testing profile that helps to identify IBD patients and differentiate between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. These enhancements to LabCorp's IBD test menu are adjuncts to our broader offering of digestive disease testing that includes cost-efficient cascade testing to help physicians diagnose irritable bowel syndrome and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.","The fifth pillar of our strategy is to integrate our offerings into emerging health care delivery models. As we have said previously, health care delivery systems are changing. We continue to see the industry evolve toward accountable care organizations, integrated delivery networks, patient-centered medical homes and mega physician practices.","Managed care companies continue to promote organized ACOs and buy physician practices. Payors and providers will increasingly move to a risk-driven model focused on and paying for cost-effective care that delivers the best possible outcomes. LabCorp is well positioned to support this transformation in health care.","Our strategy to become a knowledge partner has spurred the development of enhanced services and capabilities, including BeaconLBS, Litholink clinical decision support and enhanced IT tools. We are now combining existing BeaconLBS point-of-order decision-support, Litholink point-of-results decision-support and comprehensive clinical analytics to provide physicians with knowledge-based patient management tools and a comprehensive view of the patient's care and clinical history.","We will use all of these capabilities to provide critical insights to support diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the patient's clinical condition. Our highly successful kidney stone, bone assessment, cardiovascular risk assessment and chronic kidney disease management programs are examples of the first of many LabCorp knowledge offerings that improve the delivery, outcomes and cost of health care.","The critical components of success in the post-reform era will be quality, cost and a role in improving patient outcomes. LabCorp is uniquely positioned to meet these needs in the months and years to come.","In summary, we are pleased with our performance and the progress that we achieved on our Five Pillar Strategy this quarter.","Now Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Stephen Anderson","Thank you, Dave. \"Can you describe the impact of Medicare payment cuts in 2013?\"","The Affordable Care Act baseline for the 2013 update to the clinical lab fee schedule was negative 0.95%. And the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act re-baselined the fee schedule an additional 2% lower. These fee schedule cuts -- reductions became effective on January 1, 2013. Due to mandatory sequestration, we received an additional 2% reduction to the clinical lab fee schedule and a separate 2% reduction to the physician fee schedule effective April 1, 2013. We are also experiencing a variety of other government payment reductions, including the reduction to CPT code 88305 and the full year impact of the TC Grandfather clause. Summed together, we continue to estimate that these payment reductions will lower our 2013 EPS by approximately $0.35.","\"Why are capital expenditures expected to be so high in 2013?\"","We typically spend approximately 3% of revenue on capital expenditures. As Brad previously mentioned, our capital expenditures increase in 2013 is driven by near-term investments in facility consolidation and replacement of a major testing platform.","\"Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing?\"","For the year, approximately 40% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. As we reiterated last quarter, our goal is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 45% of our revenue within the next 3 to 5 years.","Now I'd like to take -- turn the call back over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve, and thank you very much for listening. We are now ready to take your questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It looked like the accounts receivable did rise a bit more expected on a slightly lower revenue base. Any dynamic going on there?","William B. Hayes","Hey, Bob, this is Brad. Just some timing of payments in one of our international businesses specifically. And I think the typical in the first quarter more going to patients in the form of co-pays and deductibles slowed things down a little bit.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just the pace of M&A, Dave, it's slowed down here a bit of late. Is this just the kind of the eye before the storm? Or what do you anticipate over the remainder of the year from a transaction standpoint?","David P. King","Bob, I think the pace continues to be about the same in terms of opportunities that are available. We've looked at quite a few things, a number of them we don't like the valuations and so we're biding our time and waiting for things to come along where we think the valuations are more reasonable for us. But there are still a lot of opportunities in M&A and we continue to be focused on doing the right deals that will be accretive, that will give us the target return on invested capital and that will contribute to long-term growth. And I would say, we think of MEDTOX as a terrific example of doing all those things. Accretive, good ROIC, long-term growth and expanding our capabilities and further diversification of our payor mix.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And anecdotally, on the MEDTOX, Dave, what's left to accomplish there from a consolidation standpoint?","David P. King","There are still some integration and standardization activities, particularly around platforms, reagents and supplies. But the bulk of the work has been done. It's been a great team effort between the LabCorp team and the old MEDTOX team. And we're very pleased with the way that business has not only maintained the pace at which we acquired it, but has grown.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, just first on the volumes. Still good compared to some, but maybe a little bit lower than what you saw in the second half of last year from an organic standpoint. Do you have any thoughts about what we're seeing in terms of overall industry trend? Is there any sense that maybe the higher co-pays and deductibles that you mentioned a second ago, Brad, are they getting that much higher this year versus last year that maybe we're seeing a skewing of the seasonality a little bit in terms of when people are going to use health care? Or any thoughts you have about that would be interesting.","David P. King","Tom, it's Dave. I think you've identified a couple of the major factors here. So if you look sequentially at organic volume growth last year, other than the first quarter, which was a little bit of an oddity because of the year-over-year comp and the lack of weather, basically was 50 basis points in the third quarter, 70 basis points in the fourth quarter and now we're back to essentially flat. And I'd attribute it to a couple of things. One, there is more patient responsibility. There is more going toward patient. We actually saw a little uptick in uninsured volume in the first quarter as well. And then the last thing I would say is the overall utilization environment, just what I'm seeing in terms of others reporting, whether it's hospitals, other health care services companies, does seem to have ticked down a little bit in the first quarter, and that's what I attribute probably the bulk of the difference between the fourth quarter organic growth and the first quarter organic growth. But we're doing the same things. I think we're executing well on our strategic priorities, and again, I think this is a very solid result in terms of what we see in the environment around us.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Can you just remind us what is the sort of percent of your business that's uninsured at this point?","David P. King","Tom, I think it's about 7% of our revenue, plus or minus, in that range.","William B. Hayes","That's right, 7%.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then Dave, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned some of the analytics tools that you're working with out there with some of the customers. Is this something that you get paid for separately? And if so, how? Or is it something more that's an additive benefit of doing business with you and it's ultimately more of a volume driver?","David P. King","At this point, because we're in pilots with a couple of sizable IPAs and physician groups, we are not getting paid separately for the analytics tools. What we are doing is, in my view, demonstrating our ability to integrate clinical data with lab data and then provide analytics to physicians that will support improved outcomes and better care. I think over time, the development of the payment model around the analytics and the integration of clinical data will occur, and it remains to be seen how we will be compensated for that. But I think it's a very important value-added services -- service. It's a key component of our strategy. And I'm very pleased with where we are on it today, given how hard we've been working on it for the last 1.5 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, with regards to pricing, can you talk about what you're seeing on that front? One of your competitors has talked about continued pressure and expecting pressure to continue through at least the next year. Can you give your perspective on that, please?","William B. Hayes","Yes, Gary, this is Brad. When we look at our price and what makes it up, there are a lot of variables. One is, obviously, the contractual agreements with commercial payors. We've talked about the government payment reductions. And then we get some changes also related to our payor mix, our test mix, the number of tests per requisition and even some of our international businesses. So we look at all that and how it ends up for the quarter, and we're pleased with our price. We think it demonstrates that we've exercised some pricing discipline. And yes, to your point, pricing is always under pressure. But we're pleased with our result and can't really speak to others.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as you head into 2014 with reform, can you give us your thoughts maybe around any volume benefit you would expect to get or other changes that you might expect in the business because of reform?","David P. King","Gary, it's Dave. I think reform will be a net positive. I will say there are many, many moving pieces in that -- in the calculation of how we will benefit. So you have to make some assumptions about how many people will actually be insured or be added to Medicaid and so there are -- you got to make some assumptions about the exchanges. You have to make assumptions about Medicaid expansion. You have to make assumptions about state versus federal exchanges. So you have to make some assumptions about coverage. You have to make some assumptions about pricing. You have to make some assumptions about the number of encounters per patient per year. You have to make some assumptions about how much bad debt reduction there will be, the consequence of more people being covered with insurance. When you put all of those assumptions together, as best as we can see it now, we expect there will be a volume benefit for us, and we expect that there'll be a benefit from bad debt reduction at the end of the day. So all in all, we view reform as -- under, I think, some fairly conservative assumptions, we view reform as a net positive. And obviously, the more people who get insured, the more utilization, particularly around preventive care from the newly insured, the more the benefit to the lab industry.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Any thoughts on trying to quantify that even very broadly in terms of the benefit?","David P. King","I think it's just there are just too many moving pieces to try to quantify it at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question is just a clarification on the same-store growth number. I mean, obviously, Dave, you talked about flat volumes. But can you also give us the context of volumes in light of the day count? Because I think the organic number that you are giving us does not include the benefit from the days in the quarter. Is that correct?","William B. Hayes","No, that's incorrect, Ricky. This is Brad. We have taken the day into account when talking about our organic volume experience.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So can you just help me bridge that? Because you're starting -- if you can help with the reporting number and what acquisitions added. And were there additional acquisition aside from MEDTOX in that number?","William B. Hayes","Right. So we reported the 1.1. The day is 1.6% because we reported the per-day volume also of 2.7%. So add back weather 0.5%, you get to 3.2%. And then we're saying organic was flat, which means that acquisitions were the delta. MEDTOX is the majority of that experience.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So it's a majority of the benefit for the volume. And is it also -- does it carry a lower price per acquisition? Does it -- is it a headwind to price?","William B. Hayes","Right. That's exactly right.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then Dave, can you just give us some color on what type of conversations you're having in Washington these days? And when do you expect to see an updated lab fee schedule and the timing of any other data points that you are waiting for from Washington or CMS?","David P. King","Well, we're having a lot of conversations in Washington these days on a number of fronts because, as you know, there are a number of fairly pressing issues. One is the suggestion in the President's budget that there be further fee schedule reductions, I believe, beginning in 2015 to our fee schedule. And the -- pointing out to the legislative and executive branch the amount by which our fee schedule has already been reduced in the last 5 years and the inequity of -- and will be reduced in the next couple of years and the inequity of continuing to make reductions. Second, particularly conversation with CMX (sic) [CMS] about the molecular coding issues that are significantly affecting some of the clinical laboratory industry, particularly those that are innovating around the area of molecular diagnostics. And then the general discussion of the value, the great value proposition that the laboratory industry brings and the importance of maintaining appropriate levels of payment, so that not only the large players but also those who serve the niches and the smaller laboratories will continue to provide beneficiary access and critical services for Medicare and Medicaid patients. So I don't think we're expecting any major updates to the fee schedule, but we continue to be very, very, very much engaged at both the legislative and the executive level in discussing all of these important issues for our industry and for patients and for health care services in general.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And does -- from time to time, we're getting asked about the lab co-pay. Is that something that still comes up in your conversations? Or do you think that that's more in the back burner now?","David P. King","The general topic of a co-pay comes up more in discussions of the idea of a unified Part A and Part B co-pay than it does specifically with the lab co-pay. And I would say that's still very much a topic under discussion. Obviously, we continue to believe that a lab co-pay is not a saving to the government, it's a shift in cost from the government to Medicare beneficiaries and that it will have the perverse effect of actually reducing people getting the services they need and presenting to physicians in emergency rooms much more acutely, and therefore, costing the system money at the end of the day. So we have those discussions. I wouldn't say this is a front burner issue, but it's -- there are still discussion of it in Washington and particularly among the policy people.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dave, you talked earlier about some improved efficiencies around lab consolidation activities, et cetera. Is there a way for you or Brad to quantify what those potential cost savings could be?","David P. King","Lisa, it's Dave. I think it's early for us to quantify that. So we will at an appropriate time, but now is not the appropriate time.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you expect that it would be a material number? Or do you just think that this will be something that will offset inflationary kinds of cost?","David P. King","I'm hesitant to put a number on it for the reasons I just stated. I will repeat what I think I said on our last call, which is without a lot of fanfare at LabCorp, we're consistently working on the cost structure. We're consistently taking out enough costs to make sure that we deliver great value to our shareholders, and we're going to continue to do that.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I heard your comments around ACA, but again earlier in your prepared comments, you talked about emerging health care models. Can you maybe just give us an idea of how you're working with IDNs and accountable care organizations? I mean, we clearly have seen this trend where hospitals are taking more and more volume in-house as they're buying physician practices, et cetera. What are some of the things that you're doing to combat that and to work more closely with both IDNs, physician practices, accountable care organizations, whatever you want to call the new models?","David P. King","I think the fundamental thing is to expand the range of services that we provide from just pure clinical laboratory services, which, make no mistake, are critical to patient care, but to expand those services beyond just providing a test result to helping the physician select the proper tests, interpret the test results, combine it with the clinical data available on the patient and help guide the physician to better outcomes. And so those are really primary activities. In terms of hospitals, in my view, the pressure on cost, the need for cost reduction, the changes in payment structure will lead hospitals ultimately to look for collaborative ways to work with people who can provide them high-quality services at a lower cost than they can provide it themselves. And if you look at things that hospitals have outsourced and are outsourcing, I think this will continue to be the trend. You've seen anesthesiology, radiology, emergency room being outsourced and I think that's going to continue. So we're really focused on developing collaborative business relationships with hospitals as opposed to just buying customer lists from them, and that's where we're going to continue to stay focused as we develop our capabilities inside this new care model.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just based on your comments around this new care model, do you think you get paid for not just the volume but it sounded to me like you're almost creating a lab benefit management type company? Is that the right way to think about it? And can you get paid in addition to just doing the lab itself for all of these other services you just mentioned?","David P. King","I think we can get paid, for the reasons that I mentioned in answer to Gary's question. I don't think we get paid on day 1. I think we have to prove that our capabilities work, but I think we get paid over time. And I would describe it not so much as a lab benefit management system as I would as a care management system focused around making sure that the patient is getting the right laboratory tests, combined with the right other diagnostic and clinical interventions at the right time. And that -- those are the capabilities that we're developing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So I had a few follow-ups here. So I guess, first, to Tom's earlier question on underlying volume growth. So historically, we've talked about 2% to 3% volume growth, and now we're seeing it more like 0% to 1%. I guess I'm just curious, is there any evidence at this point that we're not -- we haven't just seen a fundamental reset there, just given higher deductible plans? Or do you still expect the volume growth ultimately -- putting ACA aside for a minute, but the underlying volume growth to come back to sort of pre-recession levels?","David P. King","Amanda, it's Dave. Obviously, the environment has been persistently a low-growth environment. But there are a lot of reasons for that, many of which we've talked about and you've talked about on the -- you guys have talked about on the call already. So higher patient co-pays and deductibles, hospitals acquiring physician practices, generally muted utilization, even weather, all these things have an impact. I'm just not prepared to say that we're not going to return to the kind of typical 2% to 3% volume growth that we've seen historically. It's certainly taken longer than I thought it would. But I still feel very optimistic over time that we are going to see organic volume growth in our business because all of the tailwinds: the aging population, the development of new and more improved laboratory testing, the opportunity for a collaboration with hospitals to move testing to more efficient points of care. I just think over time, yes, we're going to see that historical growth rate that we saw in the past.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, you guys have talked about leverage and a desire to increase leverage over time. Is there any update on timing there and what you ultimately might do with those funds?","David P. King","I think we spoke to that in the prepared remarks, that we do intend to increase the leverage to 2.5x over time and that we would expect, absent sizable acquisition opportunities, that the bulk of that -- those additional funds will be directed toward share repurchase. Obviously, how and when we get there will be determined by a large number of factors, and we can't give you specifics on what the timing will be or how it will play out over time.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then last one on M&A and you've talked a lot about that already as well. But I'm curious, what type of assets are you seeing coming to market? Is it -- has it changed at all? Or is it still consistent? And in terms of your focus on specific targets, are you sort of still sticking to the core lab space? Or are you considering anything, moving outside of your core business?","David P. King","I would say in terms of what's coming to market, as you might expect, there's a -- there has been an increase in the number of pathology labs, specialty pathology labs that have come to market. There's probably an increase in the number of labs that are serving nursing homes and long-term care. I attribute these mostly to reimbursement activities by the government. There continue to be a sizable number of opportunities that we think of as kind of being right in the fairway for us, which are core clinical business, specialized esoteric business. In terms of moving outside the core laboratory business, anything that we do is going to be based on our core laboratory capabilities, and I don't see us at this point making any significant moves away from what we've always done, which is be a superior provider of high-quality, low-cost lab services. There are plenty of acquisitions in and around the lab space that are attractive to us, and those are the things that we're going to be focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a few things, starting off with the issues that hit margins this quarter. I was wondering, Brad, maybe could you quantify the impacts of the weather and payment reductions and the fewer days in the quarter?","William B. Hayes","Yes. Kevin, I'm not going to break them out each one individually, but I'll give them to you in order of impact. First, the payment reduction was the biggest impact by far to that year-over-year comparison followed by an equally -- an equal impact of the 2 items of a day and weather. So that's kind of how we look at it. When we think about those 3 things, which we can quantify for ourselves, that is the primary difference between margins in the first quarter this year compared to last year.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And with the day, obviously, that has to do with leap year from last year. But was timing of holiday and the weightings of the days in the week, was that lower this quarter versus last year as well?","William B. Hayes","Well, we take all that into account when we compute our number of days. So any holiday impact would have been in our computation of the days, and we see about a day less this quarter compared to the first quarter of last year.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then not to drill down too much, but SG&A was up a little bit as a percent of revenue this quarter. Obviously, you guys have done a great job of keeping a tight lid on expenses. Just wondering if there was anything unusual this quarter and should we expect a similar types of cost savings over the next few quarters and long term.","William B. Hayes","Yes. So if I look at the SG&A as a percent of sales, Kevin, it's sequentially in line the first quarter compared to quarters 2 through 4 last year. And it also was impacted by payment reductions, weather and a day. If I look in terms of absolute dollars on a year-over-year basis between Q1 last year and this year, MEDTOX is obviously an impact item there in terms of absolute dollars. In terms of going forward, as tying back to Dave's comments of kind of what we do on an ongoing basis, we continue to look for ways to reduce our costs by doing things better and SG&A is definitely a focal point of a number of those activities.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then Dave, just kind of slipping over. In the wake of the Supreme Court's oral arguments for Myriad and BRCA, is there any change to your thoughts on commercialization plans?","David P. King","Kevin, no, not at the moment. I think, obviously, everyone is very interested in what the outcome of that case is going to be. And when the decision is rendered, we'll make the decision about how we proceed in terms of new opportunities for commercialization of tests or there may not be opportunities. Again, it really is dependent on what the court tells us.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, understood. And then just lastly, I was wondering, could you provide any more color on the Bristol-Myers clinical trials testing announcement that came out? Is that meaningful? And are there other big opportunities you guys are looking at with any of the other major pharma companies?","David P. King","Sure. The clinical trial central lab business has been a very successful business for us over the last 7 years, and through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, has basically tripled in size, which we're very pleased about. I think the -- being selected as a preferred partner by Bristol-Myers is a validation that the many things that we've done to grow the business, to create the bioanalytical capabilities, to expand internationally with our labs now in China, Singapore and Japan, we are a real contender in the central lab business, and we will continue to pursue these opportunities because they're great from a pricing perspective and they allow us to do a lot of development work of innovative testing and companion diagnostics in collaboration with our pharma partners.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First one had to do with market share trends. Just wondering if you would mind compare and contrasting what you're seeing from your larger lab competitors versus the in-source market as we get closer to ACA implementation. I'm just curious where you see the best opportunities to pick up a little bit of share.","David P. King","Isaac, it's Dave. Obviously, the great majority of testing is still in the hospital environment and it's being performed in a high-cost environment and it's being billed at a high cost compared to our cost and our pricing. So I think the greatest opportunity for gain in share continues to be for the reasons that I've already stated and answered the previous question. The trends are going to drive laboratory services to more efficient and higher quality situses of care, and so I think we're going to see the opportunity to pick up share from hospitals over time.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And maybe just to follow up there. I mean, I guess what I should have said more clearly is, do you think there's a mindset in the marketplace that as we move closer to ACA, there's more willingness to sort of reassess where our testing gets done, whether it be through the payor side or with hospitals? Did you sense that conversations of that nature are starting to happen as we get closer to ACA?","David P. King","Yes, I do. I agree with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a few things left here. Wanted to just go back to volume performance in the quarter. And I guess, more specifically, can you give us some level of breakdown between the routine and the esoteric growth in Q1? And then any commentary about where you're seeing some strength or some softness in any particular areas? And Dave, it would be nice just to get your thoughts on hepatitis testing, given the guidelines always had some time for the physician community to react. Just curious to see how that's been trending.","David P. King","Sure. So esoteric volume in the quarter was up about 2% per day, driven by, well, multiple factors going in different directions. So some nice growth in some of our new testing, offset by some decline in vitamin D and still the pressure on surgical pathology and histology. On the HCV, the year-over-year performance is very impressive in terms of the amount of HCV screen that we're requiring -- I'm sorry, that we're receiving. There has been a significant public relations campaign by the government through the CDC to get baby boomers screened for hepatitis C. So the screening test is not an expensive test, but the volumes are up nicely. And then, of course, for those that screen positive, it's very important that they get follow-up testing, including genotyping testing, viral load testing and, in many cases, the companion diagnostic testing for which drug the patient will respond to. So I continue to think hepatitis C is a big opportunity, and we've had the leading hepatitis C franchise for years, very much strengthened by the terrific work that our Monogram specialty lab is doing. And we look forward to capitalizing on that opportunity over time, Darren.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So you did provide the esoteric growth per day, sorry if I missed this, but the routine, how did that break down?","William B. Hayes","That would be a little over 3% on a per-day basis.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, Dave, do you care to just maybe size the level of growth for your hepatitis franchise, just to maybe give us some thoughts about how it is growing?","David P. King","I don't think the -- I don't think it's meaningful to give you percentage increases in the screening volumes because they -- the percentages are going to be grossly disproportionate to the amount of screening that we do. Let's just say we've seen very nice year-over-year growth. And as we get that testing, again, our goal always is not to win tests but to win accounts, so it gives us the opportunity to provide a more comprehensive set of services, both to primary care and specialty physicians.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then if I could, just, Brad, maybe a numbers question here. Income from JVs, not terribly outside of the band of what we'd expect, but definitely a little bit higher this quarter. Can you comment on that and maybe just give us some flavor for how it might look for the balance of the year?","William B. Hayes","I don't think it was very much different than what we expected and wouldn't expect it to be that much different on the year. So nothing significant that I could point to there.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last thing. Any update at all about the Canadian operations? I think there was, at some point, some discussion that you might seek out a partner. And where are you in that? And are there opportunities to go beyond the Ontario province?","David P. King","There are a number of opportunities in Canada and we continue to spend time there. Very pleased with our businesses that we have, and we are continually looking for opportunities to grow there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of quick, last few questions. The first, on the fourth quarter, $49 million of acquisition spending. Can you -- was that an earn-out or was there actually something real in there that you could discuss?","William B. Hayes","Gary, this is Brad. I'm going to have to go back and look at that and get back to you on that.","David P. King","But Gary, it's Dave. There was nothing sizable in the fourth quarter that would have contributed to first quarter performance. As Brad mentioned, I mean, MEDTOX is the driver of most of the nonorganic growth.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then just my last question. We were reading about Aetna lowering pricing coming up this July in its standard lab fee schedule. Obviously, you don't have a lot of exposure to Aetna with Quest having the national contract. But would this -- is there any way that what they would be doing on the rate side, this particular payor, have any material impact on LabCorp?","David P. King","I saw the same article that you did, I think, in one of the trade magazines. And we -- and that's the first that we were made aware of it. So I think we're not in a position to answer that question at this time. I don't think it would have a material impact on us given the relationship with Aetna, but I can't give you a definitive answer.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. As -- I'll ask for this, but I expect I probably won't get it: Aetna, as a percent of revenue, broadly? I mean, this is, I would imagine, single-digit percentage of revenue?","David P. King","Yes, we don't, obviously, specify how much percentage of revenue any of our customers is, so I'm going to make your prediction come true and not tell you the answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with Raymond James.","Alexander  Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and I did have to drop off for a second, so if this question got asked, just tell me to go back to the transcript. Dave, I was curious if you could comment a little bit. I know Lisa had brought up the hospital trend and what's going on there. It's -- clearly, there may be some changes. Are you seeing any change in the marketplace now with the discussions that you're having with hospitals? Or is it sort of still the same in that you expect changes to happen as we get further into ACA and ACOs in further developments? Or are you already seeing more and differentiated discussions than you were seeing maybe 12, 24 months ago?","David P. King","Sandy, I did comment on that, so I'll just reiterate briefly. I mean, I think that across all of health care services, there are discussions going on about how we can provide the highest quality care at the most efficient point of service. I think there's a greater willingness on the part of hospitals to talk about ways that they can collaborate with us and build a sustainable model over time in which we can work together to provide the highest quality, lowest cost of care with the best outcomes. So there's a lot going on in health care services. There's a lot of change happening, and I think the tenor of the conversations has been very positive. But as fast as change goes, change also go slowly in terms of the way that large organizations do business, and we're going to be -- we're going to continue to be very persistent in pointing out that we can improve the cost structure and the quality side of the way lab services are delivered to patients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide a number on what you expect the consolidated charges and expenses to be on the year? I mean, obviously, you reported some in the quarter for the consolidation activity, but what do you think that number will be in aggregate for the year?","William B. Hayes","Frank, this is Brad. That's not typically a number that we would guide to.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, on the follow-up to Gary's question on -- are there any other major contracts that you have that are of significant size or coming up for renewal this year?","David P. King","Frank, it's Dave. As we've said, we are in discussions with both Cigna and Humana about contract status, and we expect those to be resolved during the year this year.","Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one final question. Just in terms of number of tests per requisition, are you seeing any kind of pressure at all from commercial payors on that? Is that a lever that they might have to try to lower overall utilization and cost, and I'll hop off.","David P. King","It's Dave. I don't think we're seeing pressure on test per requisition from commercial payors. And realistically, I think that would be a very hard lever to pull because the doctor is ordering the tests per requisition based on what he or she thinks is in the best interest of patient care. I think it would be awfully tough to tell doctors, \"You're only allowed to order 1.0 tests per requisition.\"","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones, if possible. I know we've talked a lot about your discussions with hospitals and others on ACOs and to some degree, exchanges. Any pressure or any offering to -- on their part to ask you to take on any kind of risk-based contracts of any sort? And do you have any openness to that?","David P. King","A.J., it's Dave. That was a pretty broad introduction, covering everything from hospitals to ACOs to exchanges. So yes, certainly, there are people we talk to who are interested in risk-based contracts. And in the appropriate circumstance, certainly, we would consider that. I mean, if you think about our UnitedHealthcare contract, certainly, it was a risk-based contract in that we agreed to cover some leakage as part of the initial contract. So in the appropriate circumstances, with the right parameters and with us having confidence that we can execute, yes, we would be willing to think about risk-based contracts, but that would certainly be the exception rather than the rule.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So that -- but that's not the way you sort of see this evolving? That, that becomes a meaningfully more significant portion of your business or anything?","David P. King","Not in the near term, absolutely.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. On the comment about bad debt being one of the places where you'd see some benefit, I guess, one potential, at least to narrow it down, you're running 4.3% bad debt today. How much of that is co-pays and deductibles, and how much of that is uninsured? I'm assuming that the opportunity under ACA would largely be on the uninsured side as opposed to the co-pays and deductibles. Am I right in thinking that way?","William B. Hayes","A.J., this is Brad. You're right. Most of that 4.3% is driven by our uninsured experience, so that's where we see the potential benefit as a result of ACA.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So you would say most of the 4.3% is uninsured? There's not a big...","William B. Hayes","I'd say 70% to 80% -- 70%, 80%.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then lastly, and I think you guys certainly spent some time on it last quarter, you mentioned it again today. This upgrade that you're doing of the 10-year testing platform, it sounds like that's sort of unique to this year. Can you give us any sense, is that -- is the cost associated with doing that -- or I don't know if there's any disruption, is that in any way impacting the numbers this year? Is it meaningful enough to do that, that we should be aware that there's a cost that you're incurring for that?","David P. King","No, I mean, we've called it out as being part of the capital that we're incurring, but it's not meaningful from an expense perspective.","Stephen Anderson","Okay. It's the top of the hour so we have a couple more people in the queue and I'm just going to ask you, unless it's something that really has not been asked before, please, let's try to wrap up the call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Just real quickly. Over the last 5 years, can you just give like an estimate of how much the clinical lab fee schedule has been cut? And do you think future cuts will be more driven by specific CPT codes?","David P. King","Anthony, it's Dave. We -- the clinical lab fee schedule over the last -- I'd say, this year, obviously, it was a 5% cut. I don't have the number right in front of me of what the 5-year impact was, but obviously we can provide that to you. In terms of future cuts, I think the President's budget just talks about an across-the-board fee schedule cut. I understand, though, that individual codes can be reviewed from time to time as the 88305 was this year. So I don't think there's any way of predicting where the pressure will be. But to go back to the discussion with Ricky, we're spending a lot of time through ACLA and individually, in Washington, explaining the value of laboratory services, how they drive physician decisions and support better patient care and why these cuts are really detrimental to Medicare beneficiaries, Medicaid beneficiaries, access and receipt of quality care.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And esoteric volume, I know it was up 2% per day, but what was it up in total in the quarter?","David P. King","On an absolute basis, it would have been 0.2%.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. On the uninsured, I think you said that you saw an uptick in Q1. Was that just related to the flu? Or I guess, what drove this uptick?","David P. King","Kevin, it's Dave. We don't really have any way of knowing. The patients come to the patient service centers or the tests come from the doctor's office. We don't have any way of knowing what's causing the uptick. As we've said many times, flu is not a big driver of clinical laboratory testing, so it would be surprising if that were the reason.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. David King for any closing remarks.","David P. King","Thank you. I do just want to close with a personal observation, and that is that, as I think you all know, Bob Hagemann is leaving Quest and so this is our opportunity to say something about Bob. And what I would say is there's a lot of respect at LabCorp for Bob. I think he's been around for more than 15 years. And when he started in this industry, the industry was flat on its back with DSOs over 100 and bad debt over 10%. And it's guys like Tom McMahon [ph] and Ken Freeman, West Allenberg [ph] and Bob Hagemann who really had the discipline to help put this industry back on its feet and turn it into what it is today, which is a tremendous value and a great driver of exceptional patient care. So as I said, there's a lot of respect here for Bob Hagemann. The industry will miss him, and we wish him well in all of his future endeavors.","And with that, we wish you good day, and thank you for listening to our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

My name is Glenn and I will be your moderator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Steve Anderson, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, Mr. Anderson.","Steve Anderson","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's second quarter 2014 conference call. I am Steve Anderson, Vice President of Investor Relations and with me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer.","This morning, we will discuss our competitive and strategic environment, highlight progress on our five pillar strategy, discuss our second quarter 2014 financial results, and update 2014 guidance. Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and internet. Please refer to today\u2019s press release for replay information.","This morning the Company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information. Additionally, we refer you to today\u2019s press release which is available on our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today\u2019s call to GAAP.

Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2013 10-K, and will be included in subsequent filings with the SEC. The Company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve and good morning. Before Glenn discusses our second quarter results, I would like to provide an overview of the competitive and strategic environment and of the steps LabCorp is taking to drive in that environment. Although the last three years have been difficult, the lab industry is in an enviable position to grow in the years ahead due to population demographics both in the U.S. and abroad, test menu innovation and the critical role of laboratory medicine in the healthcare system.","LabCorp is particularly well positioned as our size; scale and platform provide an anchor for our business and give us great penetration into the broader healthcare system. Our lab and PSC infrastructure, logistics network, EMR connectivity, [interfaces] into physician offices and health systems and reach to consumers through our billing and collection system and our patient portals are unparalled among healthcare services companies.","Now we must build off this platform to address the needs of a changing market. Given changes in benefit plan and design, reimbursement reductions and pricing pressure sustained utilization may remain lower than historical trends and price above -- across all of healthcare services will likely continue to be under pressure, particularly driven by mix and payment policies.","This dynamic creates opportunities for LabCorp because we believe the consolidation will accelerate lower cost settings will be incentivzed and scale will be rewarded. We are seeing this across healthcare services with transactions designed to increase scale, create vertical integration, expand capabilities and leverage existing assets. Along with opportunity we can reasonably expect that interlopers will try to disrupt our business model.","To be among the winners, we know that LabCorp must excel in five ways; improve the quality and reduce the cost of care, help manage the total cost of care, serve as a performance management partner to our customers, serve a broad range of customers in multiple settings and build scalable platforms with replicable processes that can create value at many points along the continuum of care.","In recent years LabCorp has taken meaningful steps to address these systemic changes through our five pillar strategy. With respect to our first pillar, we have continued to increase our scale and competencies in clinical laboratory medicine through acquisitions ranging from routine capabilities to highly esoteric testing. We have also focused constant attention on building and growing our managed care base leaving us with a managed care portfolio that is unparalled in the industry. These initiatives give us greater opportunity to deliver value in a $60 billion market where we have approximately 10% share.","Under our second pillar we have invested significantly in information technology infrastructure and capabilities to improve the customer experience for providers and patients who order and receive testing from us. Relative to the third pillar, we have relentlessly focused on optimizing our operations to maintain our position as the most efficient provider offering the highest quality and greatest value for the healthcare dollar spent. We have also invested heavily in improving every customers experience with LabCorp. We take great pride in our significant and continuing progress in this area which is due to the efforts of our more than 30,000 dedicated people.","Under our fourth pillar, we have actively pursued opportunities to bring significant new test to market through licensing and internal development. We are pleased that our partners have repeatedly expressed how impressed they are with LabCorp\u2019s science, test development capabilities and innovation. As an example of our innovation, our monogram center of excellence in infectious disease recently two NIH grants to study and develop new approaches for HIV detection.","With respect to our fifth pillar we have undertaken two internal strategic initiatives to support our customers at critical points, BeaconLBS and EnlightenHealth. Each of these initiatives was built on the premise that we can use our existing infrastructure as a channel to provide more value to our customers. Like other companies that have used their infrastructure to extend their market reach, we want to use our market penetration to offer new and value added services.","We undertook BeaconLBS in 2011 because we understood that providers need assistance in selecting the right test for their patients and payers need help in appropriately managing the utilization of expensive diagnostic testing. After extensive market analysis and the enormous amount of hard work, we invented a tool that helps our clients choose the right test at the right time and helps payers thoughtfully address concerns about both unit cost and trend.","In the fall of 2014, this innovative model will be implemented in Florida in partnership with United Healthcare. We started EnlightenHealth as an outgrowth of four initiatives, our Litholink clinical decision support program, our care intelligence data analytics program, our patient portal and our clinical trials business. These tools serve different customers from BeaconLBS. To assist physicians, we have developed a data and analytics tools that help them understand their metrics of care delivery and improved compliance with paper performance and population health metrics.","To assist physicians and patients we have developed disease specific expertise in kidney stone, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and coagulation adding more programs every year. We have also developed a web portal to deliver lab results, decision support and additional content to patients. We have greatly expanded the size and capabilities of our clinical trial central lab business to serve physicians and patients by taking advantage of the opportunity created as bio pharmaceutical companies recognize the need to go deep in specific disease dates and create vertical alignment from drug design to identification of unique patient populations that will respond to therapy.","We are focused in EnlightenHealth on four key areas of opportunity, personalized genomics, informatics, new channels to capitalize on our competencies in our clinical trials business. We will provide more detail on these opportunities in the coming quarters.","This quarter we continued our progress on all of our five pillars, let me mention several key initiatives. Under pillar three the installation of our propelled robot at our major laboratory in Tampa is complete and is now processing all of the facilities volume. We remain on schedule to install Propel in our Dublin Ohio facility at the end of this year. Propel continues to drive expense reductions, increased throughput and accuracy, and enhance specimen management in our Burlington and Tampa labs.","We continue to streamline our operations and reduce expenses through facility rationalization. In addition to our new Phoenix campus which consolidated four LabCorp facilities, we recently announced the consolidation of our facility in Monrovia, California into our Santa Fe laboratory and the consolidation of our facility in Mitchell Field New York in to our Connecticut laboratory.","We are reengineering our business to provide a better operating platform, sustainable long term savings and a world class customer experience. To that end we remain focused on our enterprise wide cost structure review and we will discuss this initiative in more detail in the coming quarters.","Under pillar four, we launched our BRCA next-generation sequencing assay which provides complete gene sequence analysis of BRCA1 and 2 and better equips us to meet the strong demand for this task. In combination with our care coordination pre-authorization service, LabCorp offers an end-to-end program that includes compliance with insurance requirements comprehensive testing and expert interpretation from our licensed directors and team of 123 board-certified genetic counselors and 9 medical geneticists.","LabCorp continues to see robust growth in companion diagnostic assays that help physicians guide targeted drug therapy. For example our HCV GenoSure NS3\/4A assay is the first commercially available test to provide drug resistance data from new HCV antivirus. With respect to the drug simeprevir, the assay is required prior to its use as the test for the Q80K polymorphism that impacts the efficacy of the drug.","We have positioned LabCorp to grow to the era of healthcare reform. The time into which quality, efficiency, scale and a central role in improving care delivery and patient outcomes will be key measures of success. Our five pillar strategy will enable us to excel in all of these areas generating shareholder value for years to come. We are very pleased to have Glenn Eisenberg, our new Chief Financial Officer in place. Glenn is going to be a terrific contributor to our executive team and our company, and now I will turn the call over to him to review our financial results.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. Sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, an increase of 3.3% over last year. The increase in sales was the result of test volume measured by requisitions and fold-in acquisitions which was partially offset by test and payer mix. Total test volume increased 5.3% over the last year with approximately 3% coming from organic growth. Revenue per requisition decreased 2% but was up slightly versus the first quarter of 2014. Similarly managed care revenue per requisition was also up sequentially.","Gross profit for the quarter was $569 million or 37.5% of sales. This compares to gross profit of $577 million or 39.3% last year. The decline in gross profit was due to unfavorable test and payer mix and cost inflation, partially offset by higher volume and productivity.","SG&A for the quarter was $298 million or 19.6% of sales compared to $281 million or 19.1% last year. The increase in SG&A resulted primarily from an increase in the bad debt reserve consulting fees and merit increases. The increase in bad debt reflects the increased patient responsibilities for the cost of healthcare services due to higher deductibles and co-insurance. For the remainder of the year, we expect the bad debt rate to be back to approximately 4.5%.","Consulting fees were incurred as part of the company\u2019s enterprise wide cost structure review that Dave mentioned earlier. During the quarter, the company had $7 million of restructuring in special items which was comparable to last year. The break out of this years amount has $2 million in restructuring and other special charges and approximately $5 million in SG&A. Excluding these items, operating income was $253 million or 16.7% of sales, compared to $276 or 18.8% last year. The Company also sold its remaining shares in an investment realizing an approximate $9 million gain in the quarter that was reported in other income.","Interest expense for the quarter was $26 million compared to $23 million last year; the increase was driven by higher debt balances as a result of the company\u2019s debt financings in the fourth quarter of last year, partially offset by the benefit of the company utilizing fixed to floating interest rate swaps on a portion of its debt.","The tax rate for the quarter was 39.1% unchanged from last year. As a result, net earnings for the quarter were $141 million or $1.64 per diluted share. This compares to $152 million or $1.62 per diluted share last year. The increase in EPS over last year benefited from the $0.06 per share gain on the sale of an investment as well as the company\u2019s share repurchase program.","Adjusted earnings per share which excludes amortization, restructuring and special items was $1.84 in the second quarter compared to $1.80 a year ago. The company continued to generate strong cash flow. During the quarter, operating cash flow was $207 million compared to $138 million last year as the company benefited from improved working capital including a one day improvement in DSO to 49 days.","Capital expenditures totaled $48 million in the quarter which was essentially unchanged from last year. As a result, free cash flow or operating cash flow after capital expenditures was $159 million compared to $89 million last year. During the second quarter, the company repurchased $56 million of its stock bringing its year-to-date share repurchases to $163 million. The company ended the quarter with approximately $890 million remaining under its board authorized share repurchase program.","Liquidity at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.5 billion comprised of $480 million in cash and $1 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. The company\u2019s guidance for 2014 is for sales growth of approximately 2% given our performance in the second quarter and outlook for the year we have increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance to $6.50 to $6.75.","Operating cash flow was targeted at $780 million to $820 million while capital expenditures are projected to be $185 million to $205 million. As a result, free cash flow is projected at $575 million to $635 million. This ends the company\u2019s formal remarks and we\u2019ll be now happy to answer any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby, Bank of America. Please proceed.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America","","Good morning. Glenn, with the inclusion of the full financial statements of the quarterly results for the first time since we started asking for them in 1996 you are already my favorite LabCorp CFO so congratulations there. Can you build on that momentum and actually speak \u2013 do you know what an organic volume number or growth number was in the quarter or is that we\u2019re still not able to break that out?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","","Well the good news is that one, appreciate your comments. We did break that out actually in our comments if you will. As you know the volume for the company year-over-year was up over 5% and we said around 3% of that was organic and the other 2% were from acquisitions that had been done and were timing related. So the company is continuing to see some very good organic topline growth.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America","Excellent so I missed that. And yeah Dave, we\u2019ve [asked] some prior calls you know your portfolio of investments there are there any more good guys in there and it didn\u2019t sound like there was a tremendous amount of opportunities left but this was obviously a good one, I guess it\u2019s a continuation of a prior investment here divesting the last, but are there likely -- are we likely to see more investment gains this year or is it \u2013 are we pretty much done for the year there?","David P. King","","Bob, we never know the exact timing of our investments. You are correct that the gain recorded in this quarter was the balance of what you saw in the first quarter, the disposition of that asset. We do have some other good guys in the portfolio, they are not at present as big a good guy as this particular investment and again, we don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have a good sense of the timing of how these \u2013 the investments will liquidate.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Bonello, Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.","Bill Bonello - Craig-Hallum","","Hey good morning, thanks a lot. So just a couple of questions, I guess the first one is just trying to get a handle on how you guys are thinking about profitability. I mean you had the $48 million growth in revenue with the $22 million decline in operating income not much color at this point on your re-engineering efforts, just what sort of your commitment to returning the operating growth, can you not grow operating income with you know 3% plus revenue growth you know are these re-engineering efforts necessary just to pull the line, how should we think about this?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Let me Bill, take the first part of it. To your point obviously its disappointing to see your topline growing but at the expense of our earnings. We talked about the pricing pressure if you will that\u2019s essentially the mix between our test and payers that as we now get through, call it the first half of this year maybe a little bit into the second half you\u2019ll start to see the year-over-year comps now start to level off, so effectively that our operating margins should effectively be leveling off.","Going forward especially we\u2019re taking up some of the unusual items as we continue to see the good topline growth we would expect to leverage our cost structure better, so if we can hold call it the price mix relatively flat for comparable periods, additional volume we should be able to get the leverage from. I think the recognition that the company is looking at this overall call it cost structure review really speaks to the fact that we know there are pressures, we know there is mix pressures, payer pressures that Dave eluded to in his opening remarks and as a result we believe that given this company we should be able to as any company continue to improve our cost structure improve the way we do our business and that should either help mitigate the pressures that we are seeing or hopefully help improve our operating margins going forward.","David P. King","Yeah Bill, it\u2019s Dave. I would just add that the challenge here is test and payer mix and payer payment policies, so we see very strong volume growth at the same time we know with MoPath for example that some of that volume is just not getting paid for. So that has a negative impact on price, negative impact on margin, I mean it goes up and down the P&L or infact you could even argue that it has a negative impact on expenses because we are performing molecular testing and not getting paid for, so we are -- there\u2019s a double whammy effect.","So I agree with Glenn, I think between a combination of continuing to have strong topline growth, looking at the expense side of the ledger and also either resolving through getting paid or resolving through testing process you know the process of not doing testing that we are not going to get paid for. We do have opportunity and we\u2019ve said, we are strongly commitment to operating income growth in 2015 and we continue to believe that we can accomplish that.","Bill Bonello - Craig-Hallum","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a second follow question, in your prepared remarks Dave you noted interlopers trying to disrupt the business model and lately there has been a lot of press about [indiscernible] a potentially disruptive force in the lab industry, yesterday there was someone even saying you ought to assure the big lab starts because of it. Can you give us your thoughts on sort of that assessment not the shorting but that \u2013 will disruptive to the lab industry and if so how at all you might be responding to that threat?","David P. King","Yeah, Bill. I\u2019m not going to comment on any specific competitors in anyway. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an appropriate thing for me to do. We are always interested in and evaluating potential innovation opportunities for our business. As everybody knows, point of care testing has been extremely challenging over the years from the perspective of the sensitivity and specificity of the testing, the reproducibility of the testing, how the results are delivered particularly in a more electronic era having a test drifted that prints out of an instrument that is not going to be helpful to physicians.","And so we continue to evaluate every potential opportunity for changing the model, that\u2019s what reengineering, the business is about. I would simply say that if there is going to be any kind of a successful point of care testing model with our 1,700 patient service centers, with our in office for [botanists] with our electronic interfaces into physician and hospital systems to provide results seamlessly into electronic health records.","We\u2019re going to be extremely well-positioned to capitalize on whatever developments occur in that frame work. So again, I\u2019m not going to talk specifically about any one thing or another. A lot of people are working on innovation. It\u2019s great, that\u2019s part of what our venture fund is designed to do is to invest in those innovations and see how they play out. But we welcome innovation and I think it provides LabCorp with great opportunity over time.","Bill Bonello - Craig-Hallum","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman, Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if you could just update us on the some of the payment issues that you mentioned on the molecular pathology front and some of the resolution and where you are on the states and then few comments about at some point you\u2019ve made these comments in the past that you reached a decision of maybe not doing the test kind of where are you with all that?","David P. King","Gary, it\u2019s Dave. I think we\u2019re seeing recognition by payers that they need to address this situation and we have recovered some of the outstanding balances of some states particularly some state Medicaid programs and we\u2019ve not made progress with others. So, it continues to be a mixed bag. Specifically with TRICARE on June 18, DHA indicated that they were initiating a three-year demonstration program to pay for some molecular testing that they had stopped paying for in 2013, including extended coverage for prenatal and preconception, cystic fibrosis, carrier screening.","The complete list of test has not been published. And so, I can\u2019t give you any further clarity there. But we are encouraged that TRICARE has recognized that they have a responsibility to their patients and to the physicians who serve those patients to cover that molecular testing.","In terms non-performing the testing, obviously that\u2019s a complex decision and what I would point to there is, the idea behind BeaconLBS is just to let the physicians know at the point of service, the testing is not going to be covered or is not going to be paid for and to let the labs know at the point of service that testing is not going to be covered or paid for.","So, we actually have a tool that will allow payers to implement these policies in appropriate way at the front end as opposed to the lab performing the service and then simply getting a denial and not being paid at the backend.","So, there are lot of ideas in-flight as to how we can execute on this, but we remain very much committed to resolving MoPath either consensually with the payers and if not then by explaining to the physician community that we can\u2019t continue to do significant amounts of high value testing that we\u2019re not going to be paid for.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Any better visibility into the timing of resolving that is it likely this year or we have to wait longer for that?","David P. King","I think it just going to be a long process. We\u2019ve recovered money against some of what we were not paid last year. We started getting paid by some payers that were not paying us last year. But we\u2019ve not seen any material overall improvement in the landscape, and so we continue to work hard to try to accomplish that improvement.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Is there any dollar amount that you\u2019ve kept track of what you have not gotten paid for or what you have not accrued that you would have otherwise accrued if there hadn\u2019t been these issues?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yeah, the only thing that we\u2019ve said was that the run rate last year was approximately $52 million in uncollected MoPath payments and to repeat what I said previously, we haven\u2019t seen any material improvement in that situation.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning everybody. Welcome Glenn. I wanted to just follow on actually to the molecular pathology denial question. So I guess, just as it relates to the TRICARE announcement itself, is it fair to say that you are waiting for them to publish their list, so you have certainty around what you\u2019ll be able to build and collect is that we\u2019re now waiting for. So it\u2019s the first question on TRICARE? And then the other part of it is, when we think about the $52 million, Dave, was TRICARE a material part of that?","David P. King","Darren, with respect to the list, yes, we do know that they have agreed to cover cystic fibrosis, which was probably the single largest test that was not being covered. And we don\u2019t know what the other tests on that list will be and we are waiting to determine that.","In terms of whether they were a material part of the $52 million? They were a significant part of the $52 million. And so, we\u2019re optimistic that as payment policies are put in place that that will improve on a prospective basis.","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve resolved the question with them, the question of what they\u2019re going to do with respect to the payments that were not made from January of 2013 to April 2014.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Okay. But I thought there it was reported in the press more than anything, but I thought they had made the decision to go back to Jan 1, 2013, so is that not your interpretation?","David P. King","I think if they have made that decision, we\u2019re still waiting to see the full impact of it.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Got it, okay. So we -- do you think we\u2019ll some resolution to all this related to TRICARE in Q3, is that a reasonable expectation?","David P. King","I would hope so, I mean, they have encourage -- they have said that they are working on the list and through ACLA and directly obviously we\u2019ve been we have been encouraging them to provide the list as soon as possible so that we and the other laboratories in the industry can take appropriate steps to make sure that we\u2019re going to get paid for the services.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. I guess the one other question I had for you is with regard to revenue diversification. And I guess we\u2019ve noted in your proxy that the incentive comp programs are putting higher weight on diversification. I guess the question here is what qualifies as a diversified revenue source for you guys and can you just talk a little bit about the types of things we should be thinking about in that context?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Sure. There\u2019s a long list of things that could qualify as -- in my view as revenue diversification. Starting with share gain from hospital laboratories, which is an area in which we have a significant amount of revenue, but as everybody knows, there\u2019s a lot of revenue going through hospital labs that from an economic perspective could be served at lower cost and at very -- in my opinion at higher quality by going through independent laboratory. So that\u2019s one area.","Our clinical trials central lab business is an important business for us. It\u2019s a business that\u2019s grown significantly over time. It doesn\u2019t -- we don\u2019t get paid there by managed care or by the government. We get paid by different parties and so that certainly is a revenue diversification opportunity.","More direction interaction with consumers is a revenue diversification opportunity. International is a revenue diversification opportunity. The BeaconLBS and the EnlightenHealth platforms are revenue diversification opportunities, because within each of those there are ways of generating revenue that are not going to be subject to either direct payment from managed care or direct payment from the government.","So as we think about revenue diversification Darren, I would not characterize it as, and I want to be clear that, we don\u2019t characterize it as we\u2019re going to go do something that is vastly outside the scope of our core competencies. I think if revenue diversification of how can we take those core competencies and how can we generate revenue from different payer sets, from the payer sets that are generating the bulk of our revenue today.","And if we can do that, we can use our core capabilities, but we can generate different streams of revenue that overtime will allow us to offset some of the pressures that you\u2019re seeing in the business today.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Lisa Gill, JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Thanks very much, and good morning. Dave, I was wondering if you could talk about anything specific to ACA volumes in the quarter and kind of your expectations as we move throughout the year.","David P. King","Good morning, Lisa. I think we -- I said at the end of last year and in the beginning of this year, that we felt that ACA would probably be a net neutral to us. I think from a volume perspective, it\u2019s hard to argue that we\u2019re not getting the benefit. I think, we are getting a volume benefit from ACA just because if you look at the enrollment numbers in Medicaid and managed Medicaid, in private exchanges, the data clearly suggest that enrollment is up, uninsured, the number of uninsured patients coming to see us is down.","So I think we are getting a volume benefit obviously from a pricing perspective, one of the consequences of the ACA is, you are seeing very rapid growth in the Medicaid population, you\u2019re seeing very rapid growth in the managed Medicaid population that has an impact on price, not so much from a unit price perspective, but from a mix perspective and also from a payment policy perspective.","So particularly managed Medicaid payment policies tend to be very restrictive for molecular and high value testing and that\u2019s part of why you\u2019re seeing the pressure on price. So net-net clearly in my mind ACA is a benefit to our volume growth and it has been somewhat of a weight on price.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","And then just going back to your earlier comments talking about disruptors, talking about your potential shares in the hospital market, can you maybe just give us some indication as to what you think would be the key drivers for example, on the hospital market finally getting that business out of the hospital lab. Is it as hospitals take more risk and a CEO type relationships? Is it managed care driving that? And over what time frame do you think that you can really show meaningful market share movement?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Well, as you know, this has been the biggest opportunity for independent labs, pretty much for the history of the industry and I think it remains the biggest opportunity. It\u2019s certainly going to be -- market share moves slowly. I do think that hospitals are re-looking at all of their ancillary services and you\u2019re seeing in a number of areas, ambulatory surgery, wound care, you\u2019re seeing hospitals forming partnership with other companies to provide those services in a lower cost and less acute side of care. And I think, we\u2019ll see that over time with the hospital labs, but again, it takes times, these are complex transactions and we just have to be aggressive and patient.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy, William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair","Hey thanks. I just had a question on the legislation that just came out around future Medicare reimbursement. You know there was obviously a meeting earlier and there was a lot of different discussion around sort of how CMS should look the last date in terms of collecting data and who should be involved in that. So I\u2019m curious just how are you guys thinking about the puts and takes there? And then, sort of how LabCorp physicians, if you think about Medicare reimbursement 2017 and on?","David P. King","Well, so the legislation requires CMS to engage in a rule making and my understanding is the first rulemaking is about how they\u2019re going to conduct the market surveys and that rule is due to be published at some point next year.","Then the market surveys will be conducted in 2016 basically and towards the end of 2016 there\u2019ll be a Clinical Lab Fee Schedule rule in which they will propose subject to notice on comment that the changes to the fee schedule.","So from my perspective, the rule that determines how they\u2019re going to define market is going to be very important. And ACLA and LabCorp and all lab constituencies I think its fair to say are very much engaged with CMS and trying to create a survey that would be fair, but they will accurately represent the market for laboratory testing.","Then once the surveys are done and completed, CMS will have the opportunity not kind of the way that the fee schedule has been addressed before which was with the blood instrument of across the board cuts, but CMS will have the opportunity to on a CPT code, by CPT code basis address individual testing that they want to adjust valuations.","And I would say that, I\u2019m sure CMS\u2019s view is that there are some tests on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule that are -- that should be reduced in price. And the industry feels very strongly that there are lot of tests on the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule particularly complex molecular testing, lot of CPTs that need to increased in price because they don\u2019t reflect what the commercial market pays.","So, its very hard to predict what will happen in 2017, but I think its -- I think, again its fundamental to highlight that the agreement between the laboratory industry and Congress was that these surveys were to consider the entire marketplace, Senator O. Hatch specifically stated during passage that the intent of the bill was to ensure that Medicaid rate reflect true market rates and that all commercial payment rates to all sectors of the lab market should be represented including independent laboratories and hospital outreach laboratories.","So we expect that the industry in CMS will work together to faithfully execute the intension to bring laboratory, Clinical Lab Fee Schedule pricing to market price and we think that that ultimately will lead us to a fair outcome.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then, just a follow up on some of the discussions around mix, obviously you\u2019ve launched some new genetic tests and have maybe an increased focus there with BRCA and some of the cancer panels. At what point or is there a point in your mind where mix could eventually become a positive for you to the extent that those testing start to contribute some real growth to volumes?","David P. King","Yeah. I think if you look historically up until probably even 2012 mix was always a positive for us. I mean, you look at the innovations in testing cystic fibrosis, vitamin D, micro arrays, prenatal genetic screening and mix is -- we could pretty much count on about a percent or percent and a half of mix improvement which was reflected in price over the years. It\u2019s been in the last couple of years that mix has turned and again there is two parts of mix, there is test mix so what tests are we performing in getting paid for and then there is payer mix, so who is the ultimate entity that\u2019s paying for the services.","Test mix has been heavily influenced by the growth in toxicology as we said on a number of occasions, and has also been reflected in price by the fact that we are not getting paid for the molecular pathology testing which is at a higher price point. Payer mix is affected by the move from uninsured to the exchanges where people are moving into high deductible plans and it\u2019s also affected by the move from uninsured to managed Medicaid or from commercial -- from fee for service Medicaid to managed Medicaid and even from commercial into managed Medicaid.","So all of those things have been what you\u2019ve seen in the -- and what\u2019s reported as the weight on price particularly in the last couple of quarters. Obviously tests like BRCA and the cancer panels and the ACD testing that I referenced in the prepared remarks, all of these things are \u2013 have the potential to be a positive impacts on mix and BRCA has a very strong potential to be a positive impact on mix. So we \u2013 as Glenn said earlier, we expect that we will see the leveling off of the price decline and we will start to see improvement in the mix driven price.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair","Okay. And sorry if you said this, but in terms of the MoPath and guidance, are you just assuming then that its just status quo with MoPath payments for 2014?","David P. King","Yes, we are.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Please proceed.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Thanks, hi everybody. First of all just let me try to make sure I understand. When we are talking about the cost structure review, I know at one point I guess that was a sense that maybe you guys would have a sort of significant announcement where you talk about a restructuring, I guess you mentioned a couple of things and your prepared that are sort of ongoing cost restructure. Are you still thinking that at some point of time you are going to lay out a grand or a cost restructured program or is it going to be sort of incremental from here?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","A.J. this is Glenn. We are currently in the process of looking at all the opportunities in the company to streamline to potentially restructure where we feel we can be more efficient and take out cost, so what we are looking at is a fairly comprehensive program. So at the appropriate time we would expect that we would announce this comprehensive program so which would be all the cost that would incur to achieve it as well as what we believe the long term benefit of the program is. It\u2019s just premature to talk about it currently as we are continuing to go through the work ourselves.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Okay. And then on with you coming on board Glenn, the capital deployment thinking regard to capital deployment I know on the share repurchase front, it looks like there was a moderation in the current quarter in the pace of buybacks, are you taking a review of capital deployment strategies as well and is that what\u2019s going on and maybe tie that end to relative priorities for capital deployment going forward.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yeah obviously one of the attractive nuances of this company as we intend to generate a fairly significant free cash flow, so obviously we have to use that capital wisely and there are a lot of opportunities to do it. Historically, the company is used a fairly balanced approach of acquisitions as well as share repurchases utilizing our balance sheet we are currently in that call it 2.5 times that the EBITDA targeted range, albeit that will fluctuate a bit.","So wouldn\u2019t get to focus necessarily on what we are doing quarter-to-quarter. In particular, again the second quarter was probably a little bit later once you have repurchased that historically, but we\u2019ll continue to evaluate where we can put it, again acquisitions and buybacks being the two principle modes outside of just organic needs and so overtime you\u2019ll continue to see us redeploy it where we feel we\u2019ll get the best return for the share holders.","A.J. Rice - UBS","And your thoughts on the current status you leverage the 2.5 times, is that your sort of comfort zone or do you think you could take on more, I know there\u2019s been some talk about taking that off.","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Yes that effectively the 2.5 is just one metric that we would look at. It\u2019s really more of the philosophy of the company that we want to maintain an investment grade balance sheet. So 2.5% times is roughly that proxy. Having said that, we have additional liquidity, we are able to go higher than that, we believe and still maintain investment grade with the understanding that going forward we would use the free cash flow and continue to bring it back down to that level. So as an example, should there be an acquisition or a larger buyback that ultimately would take us higher than that level with a commitment that will use the future cash flows to bring it back down. So it\u2019s you know a proxy for us, it gives us some flexibility, but we do think that its utilizing the balance sheet well and redeploying capital in appropriate fashion.","A.J. Rice - UBS","Okay, alright thanks a lot.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Issac Ro, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed","Issac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Yeah good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to spend a minute on bad debt the comments you made there is I think about the sort of the year-on-year comp into the middle part of the year. You know fewer uninsured people in the system, those people obviously tend to drive the majority of your bad debt, so theoretically that should improve. But is sounds like on a year-over-year basis atleast in 3Q you are expecting bad debt to go up, so I\u2019ll be just curious if you could talk a little bit about how the rise of ACA coverage is impacting bad debt relative to your expectation.","David P. King","Issac, its Dave. First of all what we said in the prepared remarks is that in 3Q and 4Q we expect bad debt to go back down to 4.5. So we are not expecting bad debt to go up. Second, part of the impact of transition of patients from uninsured or from their prior insurance into exchanges is that although there are premiums set to these in the exchanges, there is very limited deductible subsidies, so you actually have people transitioning in the plans, where although they are getting premium subsidies the average deductible that is before the patient gets $1 of payment in a silver level plan is about $3000.","So there is more dollars out to patients as these high deductible plans take effect and in the first and second quarters of the year before patients get through the deductibles you see more dollars of responsibility going out to patients, that\u2019s why we topped off the bad debt rate in this quarter. But overtime as Glenn said in his prepared remarks, we expect bad debt to go back to the 4.5% for the balance of this year and to decline with the overall impact of ACA with more patients gaining coverage.","Issac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Got it. I was looking at the bad debt year-on-year but in sequential terms the comment there makes sense, thanks. And then just second on testing categories, I was just wondering if you call out any areas of unusual strength or weakness in 2Q with regards to mix and then how your expectations there maybe shape up for the back half, just trying to make sure I understand any specific dynamics around testing mix that could factor into your margins?","David P. King","Well we had strong growth in core testing, obviously on a year-over-year basis we had strong growth in BRCA, in our new swab testing, in our Hepatitis-C, both the screening and the reflex testing. So there\u2019s good solid mix of growth in both the core business and in HSR testing. And then, we did continue to have strong growth in the toxicology pay management and drugs of abuse area as well.","Issac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. You just mentioned your commentary about the bad debt outlook in the second half of the year. I was hoping you could just hit on other items that are implied in your updated guidance, what you think for both volume and pricing and do you expect to see any investment gains in the balance of the year is that contemplated in your guidance?","Glenn A. Eisenberg","Frank, this is Glenn let me take a cut of that first with the latter part of the question. No investment gains are forecasted in the second half and obviously to the extent that we would have any, we will break that up for you. As you think its more broadly about the implied guidance for the second half, we are looking at relatively comparable topline growth in the company, so in order to hit kind of that 2% rate, we are going to go close to 3% kind of growth at the topline through the second half of the year and that\u2019s obviously seasonality as you look first half to the second half like fourth quarter historically up a low quarter for the company.","Similarly we expect from a profitability to be comparable, so again this goes back to the comments that Dave and I mentioned that we\u2019re kind of leveling off plus or minus on the operating margins with where we are. The big positive though is that the spike kind of second half, first half being comparable we expect to see very improved free cash flow in the business which again it tends to be more seasonal for us as well as we tend to generate cash from working capital in the second half of the year versus the first half, but nothing frankly unusual that we would expect to see in the second half other than against continued topline growth trying to leverage that realizing that we still have some of the headwins from the test and payer mix issue.","David P. King","And Frank its Dave. Just again agree with everything Glenn said, excluded from the guidance is any share repurchase after June 30, any benefit from the enterprise re-engineering that we mentioned and any improvement in the MoPath position, those are all not included.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","And acquisitions or will acquisitions be included?","David P. King","There\u2019s no significant acquisition that is contemplated in the guidance. As you know we do tuck in acquisitions and we do them regularly and so we might do some of those and that would effect where we come out in the range, but there is no material acquisition contemplated.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","I got you. One more and I\u2019ll hop. Just how do you see the margin profile playing out on these new areas with Beacon and Enlighten and what kind of margin profile will that business have and then how long do you think it will be before we really have some impact? Thanks.","David P. King","I think it\u2019s early to say what the margin profiles would be for those businesses and we know for example we know what the margin is for the clinical trials business but other parts of \u2013 health that were developing it. You know, we have some expectations but I don\u2019t think we have and then we are prepared to say. Beacon, we need to get it up in working and then we\u2019ll be able to talk more about the margin profile overtime. So I think it will be premature to make any estimates there.","Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks.","David P. King","We\u2019ve got about five minutes before the hour and so we\u2019ll have time to take a couple more questions. I\u2019d encourage you please not to repeat questions that have already been asked and answered.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Glenn Santangelo - Credit Suisse.","Oh yeah thanks Dave. I apologize in advance, but I do want to follow up on this revenue per requisition you know in the current quarter you are clearly only down 2% which is a little bit better than the 3.3% in the first quarter. So I\u2019m wondering if you could dimensionalize a little bit exactly. I think you gave us some of the payer mix changes that may be weighing on that pricing component. Could you give us and if you can give some color on test mix, but as I sort of dimensionalize that 2% could you split it out between what\u2019s payer mix and what\u2019s test mix?","David P. King","Glenn, we don\u2019t split out the payer mix and test mix. We haven\u2019t historically and I don\u2019t think it will be a good practice to start, so we are still resting on our laurels from probably will be in \u2013 in putting the full financial statements and that\u2019s as far as we\u2019ll go.","Glenn Santangelo - Credit Suisse.","Okay. And then maybe I\u2019ll just ask a second quick question. I think in your prepared remarks you suggested that you are not willing to go vastly outside of the scope of your core competency but you did sort of mention from a strategic perspective that international maybe something that could be interesting to you, are there any sort of markets that you sort of keeping an eye on that, that could be interesting for LabCorp?","David P. King","I think that the most interesting markets and we outlined this a little bit in our investor presentation. The most interesting markets are going to be markets where there is growing attention to provision of healthcare in the middle care, there is growing private wells, there is infrastructure to support the kind of business that we run, so roads, airports, transportation infrastructure and there is recognition of the importance of diagnostics. And I think largely those are going to be what I would characterize as developing markets, but higher end developing markets as opposed to mature markets.","Glenn Santangelo - Credit Suisse.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Unidentified Participant","","Hey good morning, thanks this is [Zach] for Ricky. I just wanted to check on market growth versus your organic growth and I think in the first quarter your organic was 2.5% this quarter 3%, so do you imply that it\u2019s [gaining] share or that the market is growing faster?","David P. King","[Zach] \u2013 it\u2019s Dave. You know these numbers were always subject to interpretation. I think from the perspective of looking at our business and looking at the markets around us, and looking at what I think is a really excellent job of execution that we are doing at the operational level. I think it\u2019s hard to look at these numbers and say that share gain is not a big component of how we are growing. So we are pleased about that and obviously our goal is to continue it.","Unidentified Participant","Okay, thanks. And a quick one just on the tuck ins, is it fair to assume that those are dilutive to price per requisitions to their negative mix impact?","David P. King","No I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to assume","Unidentified Participant","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Dave Clair - Piper Jaffray","Hi, good morning everybody thanks for taking my questions. So I was just hoping you could give us any metrics, the type of cost savings you are seeing after installing Propel in the lab? And how big of an opportunity is this as you kind of roll that out?","David P. King","","In terms of metrics, the only metric I would give you is that we see completion times, significantly improve so when we are getting the results out to the physicians we see reagent cost being reduced as a result of less retesting and more accurate placement of the specimens on the instruments and we do see a reduction in labor cost just because we have automated the front end. We haven\u2019t specifically spoken to and don\u2019t intend to specifically speak to you know the exact impact of any given initiative like this. As we say we\u2019re always looking at the cost structure or comprehensively reviewing the opportunities to re-engineer Propel as a perfect example of how we would not re-engineer the front end to make it work better and that\u2019s all we are going to do with the rest of the company as well.","Dave Clair - Piper Jaffray","Okay and what are your plans to roll out enlightenment and kind of beyond the initial launch here?","David P. King","","I think the answer to that is stay tuned, because we\u2019ll roll out specific, I mean some of those components like the care intelligence platform, the decision support platforms and the clinical trials business are already out and the question is our ability to grow them. Some of the components like the genetic and genomic focus and they are applying our competencies to new areas, we\u2019ll continue to evolve overtime and we\u2019ll talk about them as we get them up in running.","Dave Clair - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","At this time we have no further questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dave King for his closing remarks.","David P. King","Thank you all very much for listening this morning. I like to again reiterate what I said in the prepared comments, which is, we have positioned LabCorp to grow and thrive in this area of healthcare reform. We are confident that quality, efficiency, scale and the role that we are playing in improving fair delivery and patient outcomes through our core business through our specialized testing, through BeaconLBS and through EnglightenHealth will be key measure of success overtime.

Please go ahead.","Clarissa Willett","Good morning. And welcome to LabCorp\u2019s third quarter 2019 conference call. As detailed in today\u2019s press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet.","With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","This morning in the Investor Relations section of our website at labcorp.com we posted both our press release and an investor relations presentation with additional information on our business and operation, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today\u2019s call.","Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to estimated 2019 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on operating and financial results, expected savings and synergies and the opportunities for future growth.","Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change, based upon various factors that could affect our financial results.

We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave King.","David King","Thank you, Clarissa. And good morning, everyone. LabCorp delivered another excellent quarter again demonstrating the power of our combined capabilities. We saw strong market demand across both businesses which with the benefit of strategic acquisitions delivered solid topline growth.","We also continue to manage expenses aggressively and execute our launch pad initiatives. As a result, revenue grew 3.4%, in spite of a year-over-year headwind of 1.3% due to divestitures. Adjusted earnings per share grew 6% despite the impact of at PAMA and the opening of managed care contracts and diagnostics and we generated $363 million in free cash flow.","We continued our disciplined capital allocation program repurchasing $100 million of shares and successfully executing several tuck-in acquisitions. We have a robust acquisition pipeline and remain focused on strategic value creating acquisitions in both our business units.","Covance excelled across all measures. Constant currency revenue growth increased by more than 9%, we realized 270 basis points of margin expansion, backlog increased by over $400 billion sequentially to $10.7 billion and our trailing 12 month book-to-bill stands at an impressive 1.28.","Despite the market headwinds we are experiencing, Diagnostics turned in another strong something. Normalizing the performance for the impact of PAMA and managed care changes, we grew revenue excluding divestitures by 4%, increasing revenue per acquisition by 2.3%, and volume by 1.7%, solidly within our performance expectations for this business.","At the enterprise level, we are successfully weaving diagnostics and drug development together into a unified fold, creating value by focusing on consistent execution of our strategy to deliver world class diagnostics, free innovative medicines to patients faster and use technology to improve the delivery of care.","Among the recent examples of the power of the combined, health systems continue to express interest in our ability to both reduced their lab testing costs and bring them meaningful clinical research opportunities. Today we have 16 Covance side partnerships with US based health systems and have offered this health system some 200 meaningful trial enrollment opportunities. This two pronged value proposition continues to gain traction with health system partners.","We continue to win in the marketplace by using data as a differentiator. In the quarter and year-to-date we achieved broad based customer success. For example, by combining LabCorp patient population data with Covance's unique site location tools and protocol design insights, we deliver a truly integrated patient-centric approach to recruitment. This approach enabled us to win 9 studies, principally focus on oncology from a single sizable customer, doubling our win rate and our program value.","Companion diagnostics also continue to show strong growth. Revenue from all aspects of companion diagnostics grew nearly 20% year-over-year. As we sharpen the focus on excelling on oncology in both of our businesses, the ability to develop, support approval for and commercialize, companion diagnostics will prove a sustainable competitive advantage.","Now, I will discuss this quarter's diagnostics highlights. Our managed care portfolio continued to perform well, a testament to our teams in the fields who have done an exceptional job retaining our customers.","The opening of the managed care contracts led to a net reduction in volume of 1%, stable since the last quarter and we continue to see volume and revenue growth across the rest of the of the managed care business.","We finalized several new partnerships with health systems in the quarter. We acquired the clinical diagnosis businesses, South Bend Medical Foundation, enhancing the scope of services that LabCorp offers to hospitals, physicians and patients across the region, concurrently partnering with the health system to offer extended pathology services.","We also partner with the New Jersey Primary Care Association, which represents 23 community health centers. By using our care intelligent platform we and NJPCA will provide physicians with accessible comprehensive and secure integrated lab and clinical data, focusing on improving outcomes for patients with chronic conditions. This partnership will help NJPCA achieve key value base care objectives.","As we have stated we are proud to be included in UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network. Concurrently with the PLN in 2019, UnitedHealthcare made the decision not to renew the BeaconLBS pilot and floor.","Nonetheless, UnitedHealthcare continues with BeaconLBS for their national molecular contract beginning in September. This reflects UnitedHealthcare's approach to offer programs and networks including the PLN to consumers on a national basis.","Although the non-renewal of the Florida pilot will have near-term negative impact on revenue and margin in the fourth quarter and next year, we are optimistic about growth opportunities with the PLN; and in addition to the UnitedHealthcare national molecular contract BeaconLBS has multiple other opportunities for revenue growth.","On the consumer front, we continue to expand accessibility, transparency and convenience so the consumers may engage LabCorp when and where they want to. Through our LabCorp-Walgreens partnership we continue to expand patient access in the retail health care. We now have 58 locations open in nine states and more than 75 other locations in progress toward our rebuild of 600 by the end of rebuild 2022.","In addition, we are pursuing other collaboration opportunities focused on our share goals of enhancing tools available for clinical research supporting the ship-to-value based year and expand and health and health related services available to consumers in the in the retail environment.","We significantly expanded our Pixel by LabCorp platform to include sample collection by Covance in our patient service centers. Pixel LabCorp enables consumers to shop and pay online for many Lab tests directly.","The menu now includes 28 test packages comprised of more than 100 analytes. We\u2019ve been pleased with the initial response and continue to add offerings to the platform each month, including Measles sand MMR immunity testing.","Our relentless customer focus drives our LaunchPad II initiatives which are designed to digitize the business, automate processes, improve productivity and create an exceptional experience for all of our customers and our employees. We remain on track to deliver a total of $200 billion of net savings by the end of 2021.","Now, I will discuss this quarter's Covance. Covance highlights. Covance's strong performance is a result of building on our unique capabilities with strategic acquisitions the creation of highly-targeted offerings enhanced therapeutic expertise and focused geographic expansion. The result is added value across multiple dimensions of the Covance business resulting in strong growth across all lines of business and customer segments.","One of our key strengths is the Covance is the only zero to offer comprehensive R&D services from early development through commercial solutions around the globe. Our strength across the spectrum allows us to fully support our partnership portfolios.","The best evidence of success in the market is the market is our solid track record of moving molecules from early development into clinical services which continues development into clinical services, which continues to gain momentum with our customers.","Our newly opened R&D center in Shanghai establishes Covance as the only CRO to offer comprehensive R&D services from early development through commercial solutions in China. This expanded presence as well as our more than 1,000 colleagues in China was a critical factor in winning a large oncology study with a China based biotech.","Covance also continues to strengthen its capabilities and the exciting area of cell and gene therapy supporting sponsors focused on developing treatments for debilitating and life-threatening diseases.","Covance offers superior capabilities superior capabilities across early development, early clinical, central labs and late-stage clinical to deliver unique solutions in these complex therapeutic areas. We\u2019ve already seen significant opportunities in growth across the enterprise from pre-clinical to clinical development. Those opportunities spend our entire geographic footprint including China where adopted TCL therapies are a major focus for oncology.","We also continue to execute the key priorities in the key priorities in our Covance LaunchPad initiative and are on track to deliver $150 million of net savings through these initiatives by the end of 2020.","We are also on track to deliver $10 million of net to deliver $10 million of net costs in synergies from the integration and Envigo by the end of 2021. In short, Covance continues to deliver results and validate our decision to become a global life sciences player.","In closing, I am grateful to our terrific leadership team and our 61,000 colleagues around the globe for their consistently outstanding efforts and support of our mission to improve health and improve lives. Those efforts are reflected once again and still in our strong third quarter performance and will continue to be reflected in LabCorp's performance in the years ahead.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you, Dave. Going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results followed by discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our 2019 guidance.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, an increase of 3.4% over last year. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions of 2.8% and organic revenue growth of 2.2%, partially offset by divestitures of 1.3% and foreign currency translation of 30 basis points.","Excluding the negative impact from PAMA of 90 basis points, organic revenue grew 3.2%. Operating income for the quarter was $340 million or 11.6% of revenue compared to $343 million or 12.1% last year.","During the quarter we had $29 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to LaunchPad initiatives, acquisition integration and the previously announced vendor data breach, partially offset by the release of the contingent consideration accrual for our prior acquisition.","Adjusted operating income which excludes amortization of $62 million as well as restructuring charges and special items was $431 million $ or 14.7% of revenue compared to $429 million or 15.2% last year.","Adjusted operating income benefited from organic growth, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings that were essentially offset by the impact from PAMA of $27 million and higher personnel costs.","Excluding the 80-basis-point reduction from PAMA, margins would have increased 40 basis points. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.1% compared to 36.2% last year. The adjusted tax rate excluding special charges and amortization was 23.9% compared to 25% last year.","The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to a favorable change in the Swiss tax rate. We expect the company's adjusted tax rate for the full year to be approximately 25%, implying a fourth quarter tax rate of approximately 24%.","Net earnings for the quarter were $221 million or $2.25 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and other special items were $2.90 in the quarter, up 6% compared to last year.","Adjusted earnings in the quarter benefited by $0.02 from three unusual items, a $0.06 benefit from the favorable change in the Swiss tax rate, a $0.02 unfavorable impact from Hurricane Dorian and $0.02 reduction due to the non-renewal of the BeaconLBS, UnitedHealthcare contract pertaining to the Florida market.","Operating cash flow was $456 million in the quarter compared to $252 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings and favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $93 million or 3.2% of revenue compared to $98 million or 3.5% last year.","As a result free cash flow was $363 million in the quarter compared to a $154 million last year. We remained active throughout the quarter in terms of capital allocation.","During the quarter we invested $149 million in acquisitions and repurchased $100 million of the stock. As of September 30, we had $950 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program.","At quarter end, our cash balance was $361 million, up from $265 million at the end of the second quarter. Total debt at the quarter end was $6.6 billion and our leverage was 3.3 times gross debt to last 12-month EBITDA.","Now I\u2019ll review our segment performance beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, an increase of 0.4% compared to last year due to organic growth of 0.9% and acquisitions of 0.8%, partially offset by divestitures of 1.3%. Excluding the negative impact from PAMA of 1.5%, organic revenue increased 2.5%.","Total volume excluding divestitures increased by 0.7% over last year, of which acquisition volume was 0.5% and organic volume was 0.3%. Organic volume was reduced by approximately 1% from the managed care contract changes. Excluding managed care contract changes, organic volume was up 1.3%.","As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 1.9% to our volume growth. Revenue per requisition, excluding the impact from divestitures increased by 1% due to favorable mix and acquisitions, revenue per requisition was negatively impacted by 150 basis points from PAMA and 50 basis points from the non-renewal of the BeaconLBS UnitedHealthcare contract.","Given the nature of the BeaconLBS business, the unfavorable impact from the non-renewal of the contract is entirely reflected in revenue per requisition. As such, we expect an unfavorable impact from BeaconLBS revenue per requisition of approximately 150 basis points in the fourth quarter due to the full quarter impact.","LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $296 million or 16.8% of revenue compared to $332 million or 18.9% last year. The $35 million decline in adjusted operating income and 210 basis point decline in margin were primarily due to the negative impact of PAMA of $27 million and one additional payroll day in the quarter, which was an offset from the payroll day benefit that we discussed in the first quarter.","In addition, organic growth and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs, primarily consisting of the annual merit increase. We remain on track to deliver $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021 from our Diagnostics LaunchPad initiatives.","Now I will review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.2 million, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year, due to organic growth of 4.7% and acquisitions of 6%, partially offset by a 1.2% reduction due to the divestiture of our research products business as part of the Envigo transaction and foreign currency translation of 80 basis points.","Excluding lower cash flows, organic revenue continue to grow in the mid-to high single digits. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $175 million or 14.9% of revenue, compared to $131 million or 12.1% last year.","The $44 million increase in adjusted operating income and 270 basis point improvement in margins were primarily due to organic demand, acquisitions LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs to support growth.","We remain on track to deliver $150 million of net savings by the end of 2020 from Covance's LaunchPad initiative. For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $5.7 billion and 1.28, respectively; backlog at the end of the quarter was $10.7 million, an increase of approximately $400 million from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.2 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","Now I\u2019ll discuss our 2019 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of September 30th for the remainder of the year and includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation towards acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment.","We expect revenue growth of 1.5% to 2% over 2018 revenue of $11.3 billion. This is an increase over our prior guidance of 1% to 2%. This guidance includes the negative impact from divestitures of approximately 1.5% and foreign currency translation of 60 basis points.","We expect LabCorp Diagnostic\u2019s revenue to decline 1.5% to down 25% as compared to 2018 revenue of $7 billion. This is an increase over our prior guidance of down 3% to down 2%, primarily due to acquisitions and organic growth, partially offset by the non-renewal of the BeaconLBS UnitedHealthcare contract. This guidance includes the negative impact from divestitures of approximately 2% and foreign currency translation of 10 basis points.","We expect Covance Drug Development revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% over 2018 revenue of $4.3 billion, a reduction from our prior guidance of 5.5% to 8.5%. The reduction of the midpoint of guidance is due to the 40 basis point unfavorable change in currency translation, bringing the full year negative impact from foreign currency translation to 130 basis points. Organic revenue growth excluding cash thoroughs is also expected to be 5.5% to 7.5% over 2018.","Our adjusted EPS guidance is $11.20 to $11.30, which is an increase of 2% to 3% over 2018 adjusted EPS of $11.02; and a narrowing of the range as $11.02; and a narrowing of the range as compared to prior guidance of $11 - $10 to $11.40. We are holding to the midpoint of our guidance as the benefit from acquisitions and organic growth is being offset by the previously mentioned unusual items.","For clarity, although we do not provide quarterly guidance with only one quarter left guidance with only one quarter left in 2019, our narrowed guidance implies the fourth quarter adjusted EPS range of $2.75 to $2.85 that includes the negative impact from the non-renewal of the BeaconLBS contract. Free cash flow was expected to be $950 million to $1.05 billion, which is an increase of 3% to 13% over 2018 and unchanged from our prior guidance.","This concludes our formal remarks and we'll now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","Good morning. I just really wanted to follow-up on what's going on in the margin side. Glenn, you gave a good amount of detail. But, as we think about BeaconLBS and tightening in the fourth quarter and then probably having some impact on 2020. How do we start to think about margins going into 2020? Any framework you can give us around thinking about the puts and takes on the margin side?","Can you expand margins? Hold margins study as we think about 2020 and then anything else that you can give us this kind of just an early framework around 2020 would be fairly helpful?","Glenn Eisenberg","Sure, Lisa. First of all, we\u2019re obviously say, we\u2019re going to provide our guidance just in general on 2020, when we report our fourth quarter results, as we do it a normal course. But to your question, with the BeaconLBS, non-renewal the contract obviously, as a headwind, that will have going into next year. We've given kind of impact if you will on the fourth quarter.","So obviously you can annualize that, you have the sense of the headwinds that will work to overcome to either addition of business as Dave commented earlier, within Beacon as well as just the growth, in our overall business.","But as a general rule, directionally, and I think we've shared this with you and the others as a preliminary review of 2020, that overall for the diagnostics business with another year of PAMA ahead, the good news is we now have the managed care impact essentially in the numbers. Obviously it just started with the in the first couple of months, but essentially, relatively flat year-on-year.","And now, with Beacon non-renewal, we would expect that diagnostics plus or minus would be flat to down margins, as we look into 2020, but again, having Covance's expectation in Drug Development to see improved margins next year as well.","David King","Lisa, its Dave. I would just flat to slightly down. I want to be clear on that. Flat to slightly down in diagnostics.","Lisa Gill","And so as we think about that commentary of flat to slightly down. I think, also you talked about some acquisitions this quarter. Do we start to see some of the accretion coming for 2020? Is it cost cutting?","Like what are some of the drivers that we still think about to offset whether it's BeaconLBS or PAMA or some of the other headwinds that you have in the Diagnostics business?","David King","Lisa, its Dave. I think you're correct; obviously the acquisitions come in at a lower margin. And so as the synergies are realize that, that will improve margins. We also have the continued impact both carried over and then the additional initiatives within the LaunchPad II, program.","And so those will offset some of the margin pressure that we're experiencing. And as Glenn said, we annualize the managed care contract changes, basically in January, February. So, there are puts and takes, but at the end of the day, we feel confident that, flat to slightly down is a very realistic view of 2020 in diagnostics.","Lisa Gill","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Glenn Eisenberg","And Lisa just to add to that. To end of that while we have the annualization of acquisitions in diagnostics which do mix of the margins. We continue to see a good pipeline for diagnostics. So as we look to redeploy capital in 2020 with the strong cash flow that we expect, an opportunity to see additional benefits from that.","Lisa Gill","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to continue on the diagnostics side, I was hoping you could walk us through some of the moving parts for the fourth quarter. So you've reached the full year outlook for diagnostics.","But that also includes the headwind from BeaconLBS, but just versus the model what's going better? Is there any other headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking about for the fourth quarter?","Glenn Eisenberg","Yes, Jack this is Glenn, I\u2019ll take the first cut. But as you see with the implied guidance first on the revenue side, we're looking at a positive quarter in the fourth quarter. So we're benefiting if you will from the acquisitions that we've done that will have a full quarter's worth if you will.","We\u2019ve also as you know been experiencing the headwind from the divestitures that we've had that essentially annualized in the third quarter, so we\u2019ll get the benefit of that. And then just normal call it organic demand growth within the business, as we commented earlier, in the fourth quarter, we'll actually get the benefit of revenue day that would've been the offset for the headwind from a revenue day that we experienced in the first half of the year.","And then again to your point, we do have the headwind in Beacon, but as we look across the spectrum, in the fourth quarter, we do expect to see some good topline growth. And while we do expect margins to be down in the first quarter year on year, we expect it to be down the least amount that we would experience throughout any quarter this year, based upon that topline growth, but also based upon the continuation of Diagnostics LaunchPad Initiative.","Jack Meehan","Great. That's all helpful. And then can't help it asking a couple of questions on 2020 as well. Just curious as we sit here today, how meaningful you think the PLN could be to growth and then also in terms of some of the recent contracting on the managed care side how you're feeling about just unit pricing for the lab business?","David King","Jack, its Dave. So, in terms of the PLN. Obviously, you know, being included in it. One of the small number of laboratories is a terrific opportunity. United is -- United Healthcare is undertaking some initiatives that we are very supportive of, such as zero dollar copays for some of their offerings. And they're selling the PLN to ASL employers.","You know right now in this selling season, so we will know a lot more about the long term opportunity when we see what the uptake is among employers, but we feel very optimistic that the PLN is an opportunity to move share away from the higher cost providers to us as a high quality and lower cost provider.","I also want to point out, just reiterate that in entering the PLN, there was no downward pricing adjustment with United so our price remains what we had previously agreed to when we were selected to be part of the PLN network.","In terms of unit price, what we always say is, unit price is basically, as it is everywhere and healthcare services, a flat to slightly down proposition. So I think in a typical year, you would expect to see unit price at zero to negative 50 basis points.","The positive that we report in revenue per requisition as you know are driven by test mix and utilization. So, as we see growth in higher value testing as we see growth in esoteric testing that improves the reported revenue per requisition.","But it doesn't change the basic nature ex-PAMA, which is a singular event of unit price being sort of flat to 50 basis points down. And that's how we think about unit price year in and year out 2020 not been any different?","Jack Meehan","Great. Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. And our following question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.","Kevin Caliendo","Hey, guys. I just wanted to go through this beacon thing a little bit more. I want to make sure the math that we're doing here is right. Because if I'm looking at your guidance for the fourth quarter, it assumes that the diagnostic margin would fall to about 13% and that's for the full quarter of beacon.","And our math at 150 basis points in a revenue per requisition is around $25 million impact. Is that all falling -- should we just assumed it all falls to the EBIT line? And that\u2019s maybe how will want to think about it for the first three quarters of 2020?","David King","Yeah. No.","Glenn Eisenberg","I\u2019m sorry. That's diagnostic - I might add that's Covance at 13%, Diagnostics is higher than that, I apologize.","David King","Yes, no. The beacon part using what the 1.5% impact on rev rec would give you to call it the $25 million in revenue that you're speaking to. But obviously, there's a margin associated with that and then that would fall to the operating income.","And as we talk about beacon was an attractive business with margins that were higher than the diagnostics overall, but that's a shortfall to earnings that again we'll have to make up.","So annualizing that is a fair proxy to start. And again, we'll look to make up some of that through additional business through the business and again launch-pad savings in the growth overall is the business, but your margin decline at least the margin that you are saying in the fourth quarter as we said earlier, while margins will be down in the fourth quarter, again, in part because of the impact of beacon, that will be down less than it\u2019s been down all year.","So we actually do see some favorable this coming in. And when you look at our margin a year ago, I think we were 16.5m so you can kind of factor in that the margin will we better than what you expected.","Kevin Caliendo","Got it. Okay. That is helpful. And just one, quick one on Covance. The M&A contribution was bigger than we've thought. You talked about some pass-through revenue weakness.","I just - question, excluding the pass through what was Covance organic revenue growth? And at what point should we cycle pass the faster weakness we've seen in the Covance segment?","David King","Yeah. I think that as we said in the press release and then Glenn just stated that pass throughs - without excluding the pass-throughs, we expect to grow mid to high single-digit. And from the standpoint, variety of factors include influence the pass-throughs and study lifecycle, geographic mix, business mix.","And right now I think once we get through 2019, you\u2019ll see as we see the early development, the labs, the content of FSP mix versus programmatic, you will see a little bit of the volatility but 2020 will be a more natural year so I will call it.","Kevin Caliendo","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Dave, wanted to go back to your comment in the prepared remarks about the nine studies that won from a single customer in oncology.","Can you give us a little bit more color as to what's driving that? Who the customer was, and if you have other opportunities like that?","John Ratliff","Yeah. Kevin, this is John. We don\u2019t provide specific customers, but clearly with this large pharma customer, they've seen the value of the data. They\u2019ve seen the value of the patient recruitment strategy through the voice of the customer and the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria that they can manage, trials in a much quicker manner and more efficiently and effectively.","And so, that has then upped our win rate significantly, doubling it as well as then magnitude of dollars then from that, principally in the oncology area, but also in the NASH area, respiratory.","But we\u2019ve seen our strategies, our data capabilities work and work very effectively and, obviously, broadening that out to the entire oncology therapeutic areas as well as our other therapeutic areas that we support. ","Kevin Ellich","Great. Thanks John. So, Dave, I don\u2019t know if this is your last call, but just wanted to say happy retirement and it's been great working with you.","David King","Thank you, Kevin. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I did want to go back to your comments on sort of the unit price commentary being sort of flat to slightly down. I think you made a comment that, like it is in healthcare.","I just want to clarify that because I think as we look across, sort of, the healthcare spectrum Medicare's even specifically has pointed to unit price being sort of the overly significant driver of, call it, 6% type trends.","So I guess, I'm still unclear and don't understand how you can't get at least a CPI, if not more, increase from commercial, especially given sort of the value proposition that you present, which obviously has been evident by the open network and open contracting?","David King","Yeah, we could spent a lot of time on this Ralph. But I think, at a high level, I would summarize by saying that, first of all, just realized that from a structural perspective, the market, particularly with hospital acquisition of physicians and their ability to direct work into the hospital laboratory creates a competitive disadvantage for us, that does affect pricing, right? Because they get paid more, they have, in many markets, a dominant market position, and now they can dictate to the physicians that the lab work has to be sent there. So that\u2019s one sort of structural impediment to this idea that we should be able to get sort of market rate increases every year.","The second thing is, I think, your 6% unit price statistic is distorted when you think about the laboratory business because when you think of that for example, pharma, where you make get a 10% price increase on a drug that costs 50 time a typical lap encounter, that's going to heavily skew your overall assessment of price.","If I look at healthcare services broadly, think about distributors, think about pharmacies, think about laboratories, think about home health, think about durable medical equipment, you're not seeing price increases, you're seeing price being flat to down and you are seeing contract negotiations leading to down pricing in a typical case. So, I'm actually very proud of what we've accomplished in unit pricing over this year and over the last several years, particularly this year with the contracts opening.","And then the last comment I would make for better or worse is when you're seeing as offering a service that is readily replaceable by somebody else, it's just difficult to go in and say we should get a price increase when others can be switched in.","All that said, I will say, we negotiating our contracts for cost-of-living increases, call it type increases, we don't get them every year, but they are part of our contracting strategy. And that's part of the reason that we are able to keep price -- unit price relatively flat over time.","So, I hope that\u2019s helpful and obviously, it's a very complicated topic. But those are some of the market dynamics that I think explain why. It's not just a simple proposition of we get a price increase.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. All right. Yes, fair enough. I guess as my quick follow up here the other income line, I noted in anyone's question, but it did have a fairly sizable swing in the quarter. What was that related to?","And can you help us sort of the annual run rate of that line item and may be moving forward? Thanks.","David King","Ralph, were you at other income, is that what you said?","Ralph Giacobbe","Yes, the other income, the other net, I think went from negative $10 million in expense to couple of million dollars favorable or positive?","David King","Yes. No, the - when you look at the - call it a year ago period, the $209 million and you will see this kind of in the reconciliation of our GAAP versus adjusted that was essentially the gain on the divestiture of our Food Solutions business.","And that even in the third quarter of this year, we had - again in that reconciliation charge, you'll see the same, there was a net impact of around $2.7 million gain due to the benefit of primarily gain from our venture fund. That $2.7 million as well as the -- call it the $209 million are both excluded from our as-adjusted results. So, other income\/net is plus or minus relatively flat.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Maybe we can follow-up offline, because I thought I saw sequentially that change, but we can follow-up on that offline. Thank you.","David King","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our following question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody. So, I guess -- certainly appreciate the comments around the ongoing revenue synergies for Covance that are being helped or augmented by the LabCorp Diagnostics business.","Dave I was wondering - thinking about revenue synergies going the other direction, i.e. leveraging Covance's access to clinical trials in terms of directing that to win diagnostics business, any thoughts there?","David King","Yes, good morning. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, the Covance site partnerships provide benefits in both directions. So, the opportunity to offer clinical trials to health systems is seen as a positive because it gives us more than just - we can help you manage your lab cost, we can help you reduce you lab cost.","We can help you introduce your lab costs and manage like this we can also bring you revenue opportunities. And so I think the Covance business supports the diagnostics business in very clear way and that instance..","Glenn Eisenberg","And also say and it is strong when you get into the capabilities of the hybrid virtual trials, the diagnostics capabilities with patient service centers coupled with the Covance central lab analytics, the market access areas of clinical side, as well as the CRO side allow you to do those hybrid virtual trials in a much more efficient manner. And so that's another way of utilization of multiple parts of the enterprise.","Bill Quirk","Understood. And I guess is as a follow-up, I guess, is there any way to -- historically you\u2019ve quantified periodically, the Covance impact from LabCorp, could we - maybe talk little bit about again to LabCorp benefit from Covance?","And then secondly just on the PLNs and broadly speaking, there is a lot of chatter around others beyond United following suite, any update there? Thanks guys.","David King","Well, yes. I think that was the best way to quantify the benefits to the businesses is topline growth and Covance grown to 9% this quarter in constant currency and the enterprise, when you adjust for the divestitures grows to grew almost 5%.","So I think it's pretty that the top line growth is strong as a result of the combination of the businesses. On the P&L we continue to have conversations with other payers. Nobody has rolled out something similar. I think there is great interest in what United is doing and if it successful, we'll see followers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Erin Wright","Thanks. I had a broader question just on underlying demand trends across the CRO segment and Covance. And where are you seeing better demand trends in foodservice or FSP or large pharma versus smaller biopharma?","And have there been sort of any meaningful changes in outsourcing demand trends in your view? Or any sort of changes that you've seen in the nature of changes new business wins that you have in the quarter? Thanks.","David King","Had a great quarter in terms of business wins and they were broad-based. And so, it was broad based in terms of early development labs as well as clinical. With respect to segmenting that, the significance of biotech sector with the NR wins has been increasing and that's where the vast majority of portfolio development is, in terms of pharma, and so we see that within our order rates.","And then with respect to the FSP versus the programmatic, we do see strengths trends on both sides. We do see strength in terms of the programmatic wins as well as the FSP. I think if you look at market data, the FSP might be slightly higher.","But from the standpoint of in terms of the way we look at the business and the way that is flowing, the early development business of course is a quicker burn business. But in the central labs and the clinical business or seeing broad-based positive and our penetration in that obviously with a 1.28, last 12 is very good results.","Erin Wright","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then can you give us an update on relationship with Wallgreens or in terms of both the lab side of business as well from a CRO perspective too? Thanks.","David King","Erin. It's Dave. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks from a diagnostic side, the Walgreens, we continue to roll out the Walgreens. We continue to get very positive commentary around the patient experience from the kind of integrated side of integrating patient data, recruitment, virtual trials, where we continue to discuss the rollout of what we call the beyond PSC aspects of the Wallgreens relationship and we expect to have an update on that as we move into 2020.","Erin Wright","Okay. Thank you.","David King","So we are at 10 minutes before the hour. So we have six questioners in the queue. We\u2019d like to get to everybody. So let's please one question and one follow-up and also if your questions has been asked, please don\u2019t ask it again. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Your line is open.","Eric Coldwell","Thanks, David. You made it easy for me because there in actually hit on my topic, so I'll leave it to the next questioner. Just wanted to say good luck in your future endeavors. Thanks so much.","David King","Thank you, Eric. It\u2019s been a pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Donald Hooker","Good morning. So you guys have talked a couple this quarter and last quarter about increasing pass-through from pre-clinic to clinical trial work at Covance. I guess you have those two businesses for Covance for many years.","Is there some reason why I guess you are seeing more pass through now versus in prior years? Is there something going on in there in the science or in what you are doing?","John Ratliff","Yes, Donald. This is John. And so we are \u2013 whenever you have a large content of biotech within the early development then that movement in terms of the later stage or early late stage then moves in a much greater penetration.","I'd also say that there is a level of science and organization that we put within the early development to enhance that capabilities as we bring across the bridge whether that's on the pure clinical side or on the regulatory side whether that moves to our bio areas or whether that moves into the first demand within the Phase 1 area. So clearly the first forward up the latter is tremendous. We have over a 100 opportunities there right now.","David King","And I have to say, Don, its Dave that historically I think prior to John coming, Covance was a much more silent organization who were only development, kind of, thought about early development and why thought about lab. And under John and Paul\u2019s leadership we've really expanded the scope of the organization. In my mind worked through some of the silos. The Covance organization is much more integrated and thinking about and attracting these opportunities to pull them across and that's part of the reason for success.","Donald Hooker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro","Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. I might be splitting hairs here, but the managed care impact from volumes was about 100 basis points. First couple of quarters was about 70 basis points. Recognizing that that's a small difference, I'm more asking about your expectations on seeing a trend potentially getting better or maybe becoming a little more challenge as we think about 2020, because your large competitor talked about its confidence and continuing to add lives from United. So any feedback there would be helpful?","David King","Yeah, Mark it's Dave. I think it was - I think it's basically 70, 90, 90, 100, which in my mind is flat. I mean, we know 70 in the first quarter because the change over actually look like it\u2019s started more in February than January and then it's been 90, 90, 100. So I definitely can say the trend is a stable. We are not losing care. Our participation rates for United and Horizon have been quite steady.","And in terms of the future, we have the same growth opportunities. We are in the same networks that our competitors talk about. And so it\u2019s one of the reasons I feel very optimistic that there are number of markets for us is the demographics, the aging population, the greater utilization of lab tests as people age, the introduction of new tests and technologies.","All of those things support long-term growth as well as the things like the Preferred Lab Network that are innovating in favor of the highest quality, lowest cost providers. So we feel great about what we've done this year in the managed care contracting. The team in the ground and the field has done a terrific job and we're really proud of it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.","Matt Larew","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Dave you just mention some of the broader dynamic constraining on the laboratory in the next several years. Just wanted to know whether you are early enough with Walgreens in terms of whether you're reshaping up your footprint to more of a retail setting, it could be a long-term driver or share that something with the providers of scale that can't be replicated by some of your hospital or competitors?","And then second, if you think this is sort of in the second year PAMA, whether you're starting to see a sort of step change and the willingness or interest of hospital and average labs to partner with you? Thanks.","David King","Sure. So second question first. Yes I think the dynamics of PAMA are being \u2013 becoming much more well recognizing the marketplace. It is affecting the industry and we\u2019ve talked about some of the - of the ways with the challenges the smaller providers or smaller labs are facing.","I am going to say, again as I\u2019ve said, along it's not a good thing for patients. Patient access is being limited nursing home patients are left without range of services it's very unfortunate situation and we continue to work very hard through to lay back and to the lawsuit to reverse the misguided way in which this has been implemented by CMS.","In terms of the Walgreens opportunity and thinking about offerings more opportunity in the retail setting, I think if Walgreens is being more complementary to our footprint then replacing a lot a lot of the existing footprint. Patients just don\u2019t want to come to patient service centers in the doctor's office or new the doctor\u2019s offices.","At the same time, there are a lot of patients who are not - who are not fasting or whom want to come in the afternoon, we are going to able to make use of Walgreens that have to make to the drug store.","Mostly people leave the doctor's office with the prescription to pick-up and lap slip we provide them the opportunity to fill the prescription and get their labs done there. So I think I also think as Walgreens and other retailers start monitoring more broadly in offering broader health care services.","So urgent care is in the retail in the retail, clinics retailer, we work for CBS and in many clinic and all of these things are going to lead to further growth opportunities for us and that's why we had so much focus on the consumer and on being the patient where they want to be met.","Matt Larew","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our following question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik De Bruin","Hi. Good morning and thanks for the question. So, just a \u2013 just going back to think about fourth quarter the last year, there was obviously a number of headwind from the DTC volumes and potentially in-sourcing from other hospitals and probably such a contract shipped weather.","I'm just trying to infect \u2013 I am just trying to understand - I am just trying to understand the impact when you start to think about normalizing the outlook for 4Q this time and then compared it last year? So what better what\u2019s worse when you look at this? And I am just trying \u2013 I am just trying to figure out where we are at the various headwinds and where \u2013 what\u2019s going to get annualized in this?","And I mean, obviously \u2013 something is gotten better? And I mean, obviously something's got a better and now it got the full impact of United contract switch, but just sort of compare and contrast on \u2013 from the quarters it would be great? Thanks. That's my only question.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yeah, Derik. This is Glen. I'll take the first one. To you point, we did have a softness in the fourth quarter last year. But when you really think about from this year's standpoint, we have good organic volume growth again, with the offset being opening up in the managed care contract. We have a full year impact of our LaunchPad initiative.","We will have a benefit of a revenue day. The acquisitions that we've done are additive to \u2013 call it the annualization of our divesture that would have been there in the fourth quarter of last year, that\u2019s not going to be in the fourth quarter of this year.","So as you \u2013 you know, fair amount of pluses and minuses but from our perspective we expect to see good growth, good margins, albeit still down, even a year ago, but that's all driven off of PAMA. But again, the least of margin decline that we would've seen year-on-year for this year setting us up well as we move into the next year.","David King","Derik. Its Dave. I think two major factors that we spoke about the last year in the fourth quarter were the hospital volumes and then direct-to-consumer genetic testing. And we haven\u2019t seen any impact or unusual change in hospital volumes this year so far, at any point the way that did last year in the fourth quarter.","And as we've said and - continue to say that we modeled the direct-to-consumer businesses basically flat to down. So those are the status if you will of the items that we call out last year in 4Q is being the headwinds. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Ricky Goldwasser","Yeah, hi. Good morning. And so Dave going back to some of your prepared comments when you talked about BeaconLBS, you highlighted that there are multiple opportunities for growth with other payers. So maybe you can share with us what type of discussions you are involved with?","And also from a payer perspective, what's the value-add? But also when - if payers need to kind of decide we want to do -- do we want to adopt BeaconLBS versus a Preferred Lab Network. What you think is easier from a payer perspective?","And then just follow-up question that I have is, your comments around margin for next year for diagnostic being flat to slightly down -- in line with what you said when we last met back in September in our conference and we view them as very, very bullish.","So my question - my follow-up question on that is back in September did you factoring that the exit of Beacon already into your comments or r have other things transpired since that help off that in help you maintain that kind of that positive outlook into next year? ","Dave King","Good morning, Ricky. I\u2019ll start. First of all, in the prepared comments I said BeaconLBS has multiple other opportunities for revenue growth. I didn't specifically talk about payers.","There are some opportunities with payers, but there are multiple other opportunities with ACO's - with health systems that want to manage utilization internally --with large multi-disciplinary physicians, specialty practices that want to adhere to clinical guidelines for testing.","So the value proposition is and - by the way I will say from my perspective BeaconLBS was huge success in Florida. Certainly there was some market push-back about utilization management. But there were significant savings realized. There was a much higher level of network adherence from physician so it certainly works.","And in my view the decision that United made was as I said in the prepared comments, it was a strategic decision on their part to offer programs and networks including the PLN and BeaconLBS to consumers on a national basis.","So I think of the opportunity for any payer or provider or health systems looking at BeaconLBS as it's an opportunity to enhance testing utilization, pursuant to evidence based guidelines. It\u2019s an opportunity to manage \u2013 the use of high cost testing particularly by non-network providers.","And it's an opportunity to engage directly with the physician about test selection at the point service to educate them about when they are choosing the right test and what it\u2019s going to cost the patient to have the test performed.","So that's - I think why we are optimistic about the revenue opportunities for BeaconLBS despite the non-renewal in Florida. In terms of the margin Glenn, you want to comment on that one.","Glenn Eisenberg","Yeah. Ricky, obviously when we were together in September, and we did talk kind of the flat to slightly down, you know, our margin outlet for next year, which again will provide more color as we go into 2020.","There is just obviously a wide range of outcomes, obviously at that time we knew the potential for the non-renewal of the contract is one of the factors that come in, which is why we\u2019re giving you a little bit of bandwidth relative to our margin expectations.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to your speakers for any further remarks.","Glenn Eisenberg","Thank you.","David King","Well, I guess we have to do a little valedictory here, so what I want to talk about is that on October 6, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of LabCorp as a Company, which is pretty amazing when you think about it. In 50 years of history here, one thing we've learned is that when we begin an amazing journey and pursue it with preparation and passion, there's no telling where it could end.","And I am at the end of an amazing journey; I've been enormously privileged to play a part in an incredible process of growth and transformation at this company. And I want to thank all of you for your encouragement and your support along the way.","I am leaving the company in great hands. We have outstanding leaders succeeding in terms of Adam Schechter and John, Paul, and Glenn and the entire LabCorp and Covance leadership team, and of course, our 61,000 dedicated colleagues around the world. I couldn't feel better about the long term opportunities for this business, and the long term validity and proven success of our strategy.","So I know that the LabCorp flame will burn brightly while the torch isn't keeping of our next generation of leaders. I wish every one of you good luck and Godspeed. Thank you and good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Frommer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Scott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's fourth quarter 2017 conference call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Dave King, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Gary Huff, CEO of LabCorp Diagnostics; and John Ratliff, CEO of Covance Drug Development.","In addition to our press release, we also filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes additional financial information. Both are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com and include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP.","Finally, we are making forward-looking statements during today's call. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to statements with respect to 2018 guidance, and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on operating and financial results, and the opportunities for future growth.","These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2016 Form 10-K, subsequent Forms 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave King.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Scott, and good morning. By every measure, LabCorp excelled in 2017. Revenue over $10 billion, adjusted EPS at the top of our guidance range, and free cash flow in excess of $1.1 billion. We invested approximately $2 billion in strategic acquisitions across both businesses, and returned approximately $350 million to shareholders, keeping our leverage around 3 times debt to EBITDA.","Our performance in the fourth quarter demonstrated our multifaceted platform for growth as organic initiatives, contributions from acquisitions, and margin improvement in Diagnostics and Drug Development translated into double-digit increases in revenue and EPS, and outstanding free cash flow.","Our platform positions us for another year of strong growth in 2018. Our guidance, despite the negative impact from PAMA, contemplates continued increases in revenue and EPS, producing significant cash flow that we plan to deploy to support growth, create opportunities for our people, and deliver shareholder value.","To achieve our guidance in 2018, we are relentlessly focused on execution across our key priorities, driving profitable growth, integrating key acquisitions, and optimizing enterprise margins. Our focus on profitable growth starts with our enterprise-wide commitment to quality, service and innovation. These qualities are critical to retaining existing customers and attracting new ones.","In Diagnostics, they provide the foundation for new and deeper collaborations with health systems, large physician groups, and managed care partners. They also create growth opportunities in women's health, medical drug monitoring, genetics and oncology testing, as well as in critical collaborations such as Walgreens and 23andMe.","In Drug Development, these qualities are the foundation of our strength in book-to-bill and net orders, and will drive 2018 revenue conversion. Our ongoing strategic investments in precision medicine, therapeutic expertise, FSP solutions, and biologic drug development capabilities continue to increase our win rate with existing partners, and strengthen our value proposition that is winning new customers.","Our second priority for 2018 is integrating key acquisitions flawlessly. The integration of Chiltern is proceeding at a robust pace. We've incorporated key talent into our Drug Development leadership team and introduced new branding that underscores our commitment to Chiltern's legacy customers and businesses. Our clinical drug and medical device development offerings now have greater scale and capabilities benefiting customers of Covance and Chiltern alike.","In Diagnostics, our partnerships with Mount Sinai and PAML's former owners, Providence and Catholic Health, continue to expand as we integrate these premier businesses. We expect these three transactions benefiting from a full year of ownership and growth to generate approximately $500 million in incremental profitable revenue in 2018, and we look forward to updating you on these integrations during the year.","To optimize enterprise margins, we combined profitable revenue growth and acquisition integration with our LaunchPad business process improvement initiative. LaunchPad is a long-term reengineering of our business to streamline the delivery of services through the use of innovative tools and technology.","Covance LaunchPad is a multi-year undertaking that will align people and capabilities with client and business demand, utilize automation and new IT platforms to create efficiencies and enhance our customers' experience with Covance through investments in commercial and operational processes. We expect having achieved $20 million in savings in 2017 to achieve additional net savings of $130 million through the three-year period ending in 2020, significantly increasing our Drug Development margins.","We expect that driving profitable growth, integrating acquisitions, and optimizing our enterprise margins will lead to strong revenue and earnings growth in 2018 despite the headwind we face from PAMA. The combination of Diagnostics and Drug Development capabilities is a powerful creator of shareholder value in the near-term.","At the same time, we must think about how we can expand LabCorp's role over time in the rapidly-evolving healthcare system. We are focused on three strategic initiatives to broaden our role in the healthcare system of the future. First, we will support our customers' transition to value-based care. Second, we will streamline the Drug Development process. Third, we will create a broad consumer engagement platform that integrates diagnostics, devices and therapeutics. I will now discuss our thinking in each of these areas.","In value-based care, our combination of world-class Diagnostics and Drug Development capabilities is critical in accelerating progress to a more precise and personalized healthcare. From helping choose the right test for the right patient at the right time to offering innovative molecular and genetic tests, to delivering the next-generation of life-saving drugs, LabCorp is a critical player in enabling targeted, tailored, high-value care. Our quality, scale, IT expertise, standardized platforms, and payer and provider collaboration support our goal of bringing differentiated value to value-based care.","In Drug Development, our end-to-end capabilities, industry leadership in companion diagnostics and investments in real-world evidence capabilities and market access solutions enable customers to demonstrate the value of a treatment to all healthcare stakeholders. Our second strategic initiative focuses on enhancing the drug development process. Client demand for data-driven study design, scalable tools, and access to relevant biomarkers and tests is at an all-time high, as clinical studies are increasingly complex, costly and facing increased competition for patients and investigators.","We offer comprehensive and differentiated solutions to these challenges, underpinned by our scientific and therapeutic expertise. Furthermore, we continue to invest in tools and technology to capitalize on the competitive advantage conferred by our comprehensive patient data, our extensive site and investigator performance data, and our industry leadership in concurrent development of therapeutics and companion diagnostics.","We also continue to utilize the combined capabilities of our enterprise to support innovative trial designs. For example, we recently completed our second virtual real-world evidence study, in which our Covance Market Access team enrolled patients and monitored their progression through its call center. Our LabCorp Diagnostics patient service centers performed blood draws and biometric measurements, and our Covance central lab performed the associated testing. This site-less approach improves the speed and lowers the cost of studies, and we expect to expand this highly-attractive offering in 2018.","Our third strategic initiative is to develop a broad platform to deepen our consumer relationships. We have made strong progress improving the user experience of our services and continue to roll out new tools and technology, including LabCorp Express, LabCorp PreCheck and LabCorp Patient. We will release a mobile app version of LabCorp Patient later this quarter for added consumer convenience as an additional option to the currently available Patient portal.","Consumer engagement supports growth in both of our businesses. Our database of patients who've provided consent to learn about relevant clinical trials exceeds 200,000 participants, and we expect to drive this figure significantly higher in 2018.","New channels of care delivery, such as LabCorp-Walgreens and the launch of our new self-collection offering for home use later this year, significantly expand our reach and engagement with consumers. For example, in the LabCorp-Walgreens sites in Denver, 28% of the patients are new to LabCorp, demonstrating our success in meeting consumers where they want to be met and supporting expansion of this initiative into new markets.","As a reminder, we will provide an in-depth view of our business and key initiatives on February 27 at our Investor and Analyst Day event. We hope that you will join us for or listen to the webcast of this event. In closing, I'm proud that we have made meaningful advances in 2017 on our mission to improve health and improve lives. I am deeply grateful to our 57,000 mission-driven colleagues around the world for their passion, commitment and hard work.","We are intently focused on delivering another strong year in 2018. At the same time, as a global leader in life sciences, we will continue to focus on expanding our critical role in the healthcare system of the future by broadening our capabilities, increasing our reach and relevance, and delivering innovative solutions that only LabCorp can offer. Through these initiatives, LabCorp will benefit consumers, customers, employees and shareholders in 2018 and beyond.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Thank you, Dave. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development segments, and conclude with our 2018 guidance.","Revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, an increase of 13.2% over last year as acquisitions added 10%, organic revenue increased 2.6%, and we benefited from foreign currency translation of 60 basis points. Operating income for the quarter was $354 million, or 13.1% of revenue, compared to $323 million or 13.5% last year.","During the quarter, we had $39 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to the LaunchPad initiative, as well as the acquisition and integration of Chiltern. Adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization of $63 million, restructuring charges and special items was $456 million or 16.9% of revenue, compared to $388 million or 16.2% last year. The $68 million increase in adjusted operating income and 70 basis point improvement in margin were primarily due to acquisitions, organic volume, price mix and LaunchPad savings.","Income taxes for the quarter were impacted by a $519 million one-time benefit from tax reform in the United States. This benefit included the favorable revaluation of deferred taxes, partially offset by the deemed repatriation tax. Excluding this net benefit, other special charges and amortization, adjusted tax rate was 34.5%, compared to 33% last year. This increase was primarily due to the mix of domestic versus foreign taxes. We expect the company's adjusted tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 25% compared to 33.4% in 2017, benefiting from the lower U.S. tax rate.","Net earnings for the quarter were $707 million, or $6.81 per diluted share, including the benefit from tax reform. Adjusted EPS, which excludes tax reform, amortization, restructuring charges and other special items were $2.45 in the quarter, up 14% over last year.","Operating cash flow was $564 million in the quarter compared to $449 million a year ago. The strong level of operating cash flow was higher than our guidance due to improved working capital, which was driven by accelerated cash collections across our businesses as a result of our LaunchPad initiatives. Capital expenditures totaled $96 million or 3.6% of revenue compared to $74 million or 3.1% last year. As a result, free cash flow was $468 million in the quarter compared to $375 million last year. During the quarter, we invested $83 million in acquisitions, paid down $443 million of debt and repurchased $40 million of stock.","As of December 31, we had $407 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. Our cash balance at year-end was $317 million, down from $409 million at the end of the third quarter, and total debt was $6.8 billion, down from $7.2 billion last quarter. The company's leverage decreased during the quarter to 3.2 times gross debt to last 12 months pro forma EBITDA as of December 31st.","Now, I'll review our segment performance beginning with LabCorp Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, an increase of 8.6% over last year. The increase in revenue was driven by acquisitions, organic volume, measured by requisitions and the benefit from currency translation of approximately 30 basis points.","Revenue per requisition increased by 1.8% due to acquisitions. Total volume increased 6.6%, of which organic volume was 2.9%. Acquisition volume was 3.7%, led by the PAML and Mount Sinai transactions. LabCorp Diagnostics' adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 19.6% of revenue compared to $318 million or 19% last year. A $39 million increase in adjusted operating income and 60 basis point improvement in margins were primarily due to strong revenue growth inclusive of acquisitions and LaunchPad savings.","Now, I'll review the performance of Covance Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $886 million, an increase of 24% over last year, led by the acquisition of Chiltern, as well as organic growth and the benefit from 140 basis points of foreign currency translation.","Adjusted operating income for the segment was $135 million or 15.2% of revenue compared to $106 million or 14.9% last year. The increase in operating income and margin were primarily due to the acquisition of Chiltern, organic revenue growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs.","During the quarter, Drug Development revenue and operating margin increased sequentially, and year-on-year both organically and including Chiltern. In addition, the company remains on track to deliver cost synergies from the integration of Chiltern of $30 million within three years of the acquisition.","We also continue to benefit from our Covance LaunchPad initiative, which began in July 2017. In addition to the $20 million of savings realized in 2017, we expect this initiative to deliver another $130 million of savings through the three-year period ending in 2020, with one-time costs of approximately $50 million, of which approximately half was incurred in 2017.","We expect the savings to come from labor productivity, including global organizational design and the right-sizing actions implemented in 2017 as well as from integration of new tools and technology, and process improvements. Drug Development delivered another strong quarter of net orders and book-to-bill. For the trailing 12-months, net orders were $4.1 billion, producing an improved net book-to-bill of 1.36. Backlog at the end of the quarter increased to $7.1 billion, and we expect approximately $2.8 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.","Now, I'll discuss our 2018 guidance, which includes adoption of the new revenue recognition standard as of January 1, 2018. To evaluate our year-on-year performance on a consistent basis, we applied the expected revenue recognition changes to our 2017 results, which we refer to as restated revenue, and can be found in our press release.","This restatement will be finalized when we report our first quarter results. In LabCorp Diagnostics, the impact of this accounting change will reduce revenue, and increase margins as bad debt will be treated as a reduction in revenue rather than SG&A expense. In Covance Drug Development, the impact of this accounting change will increase revenue, and cost of revenue due to the inclusion of investigator fees and other pass-through expenses in both categories, which will result in lower margins.","For the enterprise, we estimate that the impact of the new revenue recognition standard would have increased revenue and adjusted operating income in 2017 by $213 million and $3 million, respectively, and would have lowered adjusted operating margin by approximately 40 basis points.","In addition to revenue recognition, our 2018 guidance includes the implementation of tax reform in the United States. Foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2017, for the remainder of the year, and the impact from currently-anticipated deployment of free cash flow towards acquisitions, share repurchases, and debt repayment. Taking these assumptions into consideration, I'll now provide our guidance for 2018.","We expect revenue growth of 9.5% to 11.5% over 2017 restated revenue of $10.4 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 60 basis points of currency translation. We expect LabCorp Diagnostics revenue growth of 3% to 5% over 2017 restated revenue of $6.9 billion. This growth includes the negative impact from the implementation of PAMA legislation of approximately 1% as well as the benefit of approximately 20 basis points of currency translation.","We expect Covance Drug Development revenue growth of 20% to 24% over 2017 restated revenue of $3.6 billion, which includes the benefit of approximately 140 basis points of currency translation. The acquisition of Chiltern closed on September 1, 2017, and we expect that it will be the largest driver of growth in 2018. On an organic basis, we expect the business to grow revenue at its historical growth rate of mid to high-single-digits.","Our adjusted EPS guidance is $11.30 to $11.70, an increase of 18% to 22% over $9.60 in 2017. We expect the quarterly distribution of earnings to approximate the distribution last year. However, the first quarter will be further negatively impacted by the more severe weather experienced this year. The benefit from the lower tax rate is expected to contribute approximately $1.30 to adjusted EPS in 2018, while the negative impact from implementation of the PAMA legislation is expected to reduce adjusted EPS by approximately $0.50. Excluding the impact of these two changes, we would have expected adjusted EPS to increase double-digits.","Our free cash flow guidance is $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year. The expected lower tax rate of approximately 25% in 2018 will result in an increase in our cash flow. We expect to invest a portion of this increase in our people and infrastructure with the remainder deployed in a manner consistent with our long-standing approach to capital allocation. In 2018, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue, driven by accelerated investments in facilities, technology, and automation.","In summary, we're enthusiastic about our prospects for 2018. We expect another year of strong top line growth, and business process improvement initiatives to translate into attractive earnings and significant free cash flow. In addition, we expect to deploy our free cash flow to strategic acquisitions, the return of capital to shareholders, and debt reduction, which will continue to build long-term shareholder value.","This concludes our formal remarks, and we'll now take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. So I want to focus on Covance, the outlook there is better than we are looking for. In your view, what's driven the improvement in book-to-bill over last few quarters, and was there anything noteworthy on the cancellation front just in the fourth quarter to keep in mind?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Jack, it's Dave. I'll start very briefly, and then turn it over to, John. John made a comment to me yesterday, which is, I guess, the most succinct explanation that I've heard of the order and book-to-bill performance, which is, we're winning in the marketplace. And with that \u2013 and by the way, a lot of that is testament to John's terrific leadership, and the quality of the leadership team at Covance, today. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to, John for more detail.","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think we, Jack, continue to benefit from the strategic investments in the team, technology and our capabilities, the solutions that we're bringing forward, companion diagnostics being one example of that. I do think that, well, it is broad-based, so it is in early development. It is in labs. It is in clinical.","We've gotten a benefit in terms of clinical with obviously the acquisition of Chiltern, but book-to-bill even without Chiltern would be consistent with what our last 12 months are. And so, strength across the board and the cancellations are in line with historical. So there's been no abnormalities at all in terms of the cancellation within the quarter.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And as you think about the three businesses within Covance, just in the context of the strategy and don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but how do you think early development fits, and what's the plan to accelerate growth within that piece of Covance?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Jack, it's Dave again, to start. Obviously, we've responded to this question a number of times over time, and would continue to say the same thing, which is the early development business right now is performing extremely well. As mentioned in our prepared comments, the value of the end-to-end capabilities of Covance seems to become more and more clear as we win business across segments. And so, strategically, at this moment, early development is a very sound fit for what we're trying to accomplish in value-based care and in the streamlining of the drug development process.","I think there will come a point later this year, and some of it is reflected in the reinvestment of some of the tax benefit in the capital expenditures that we will need to make some investments in capabilities for the business, particularly in facilities. But that's a determination that we'll make a little bit further down the road. John, anything further?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No. I'd say that the early development we're seeing flow through business, whether that'd be in the tox area, and obviously within the large molecule and immuno-oncology being a large percentage of our oncology platform. And then, in the BioA area and the significant flow-through into our clinical business, so it's a little bit additive to what Dave said.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you both.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Suzie Yoon - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Suzie Yoon in for Ross.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","You're going to have to speak up.","Suzie Yoon - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, sorry. Do you hear me better?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes.","Suzie Yoon - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Suzie Yoon in for Ross. Our channel check suggests that you've been gaining share across the CRO, particularly in small to mid-cap biopharma. What areas did you see particular strength in the quarter?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Well, we saw \u2013 this is John \u2013 we saw strength really broadly. We did see strength in terms of the small-medium. Obviously, we benefit from the strength of the Chiltern, and the fact that they had a large penetration in that category. But at the same time, we have a big penetration within our early development in terms of the small-medium areas as well.","But I would say, large pharma in terms of mid-tier and small-medium, if you look at our win rates, they were even broad against that spectrum. So strength across all, you could see more of the penetration in the large in the central labs, in the mid-tier and the small-medium in terms of their early development, as well as the clinical business, strength across the board.","Suzie Yoon - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And just as a follow-up, wondering if you can give us some details on the composition of the Diagnostic beat and what product areas you're seeing particular strength in there?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. The primary strengths were in women's health, in particular our single swab, new swab testing, medical drug monitoring within our toxicology and wellness business, and oncology and genetics within our molecular testing. I think those would be the particular areas where we saw strong both year-on-year and end growth over the quarter. We continue to have good strength in 23andMe, although its relative contribution as a percentage of the organic growth was actually less than the prior quarter. Gary, anything further to add?","Gary M. Huff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No, I think that covers it. Thank you.","Suzie Yoon - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning. Dave, I think I heard in your prepared comments talking about value-based care. Clearly, there's a lot of opportunities here in the marketplace. I just want to understand specific to that comment that you're well-positioned, are you seeing, one; a change in contracting, or two; are you talking about, now that we have PAMA in place, you could see incremental opportunities with hospitals and others as we change from a fee-for-service environment to more value-based care? I just want a little more color as we think about that progression for LabCorp. And then, secondly, just a point of clarification. Glenn, I just want to understand. There's no share repurchase in the guidance. Is that correct?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Lisa. It's Dave. My understanding is that capital deployment is included in the guidance, but Glenn will verify that. In terms of the value-based care, the way I would characterize it is, we are seeing a shift in terms of how payers and providers are thinking about reimbursement. And obviously, value is in the eye of the beholder, and everybody has a different perspective on what's value, generally value is what causes me to have more, and the other guy to have less. So we have to think about it in the context of \u2013 as 3% of the spend driving 80% of the decisions, how do we enhance the value proposition beyond simply the delivery of lab results?","And that's why the precision medicine, the companion diagnostics, the ability to not only deliver the right test for the right patient at the right time, but also to deliver things like our chronic kidney disease solution, our kidney stone recurrent solution, to actually help providers deliver care in accordance with guidelines as to value. That's why Covance adds to value with being able to bring to health systems and large physician groups the opportunity to participate in trials, and get their acutely ill patients access to cutting-edge medications.","There's a whole range of capabilities around the combination of our enterprise that in our view position us better than anybody else to deliver in the value-based care environment. So hopefully, that helps clarify the perspective on why we think we are well-positioned, and why we continue to invest not only in the individual capabilities of the businesses, but in the combined capabilities of the enterprise that are going to be so critical to differentiate ourselves when people look at us vis-\u00e0-vis others would say, well, how do you contribute to value?","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I would assume you're going to talk more about this at the Analyst Day, Dave, but I guess for me, the question just really is, do we see a changing business model in some way? So the way that you get paid today, you talked about shifting away from just the lab tests and being part of the bigger solution. So as we think about your changing and evolving business model, is it that we're going to see payment mechanisms change as well? And again, I would assume we're going to probably talk more about this in the next couple of weeks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","We will, yeah. I mean, I do think, over time payment mechanisms will change. Again, when you talk to the payers, they will tell you that they have x percent of their providers on some sort of value-based contract. Now, granted, they may be different value-based metrics. There may be different definitions of what's value.","But over time, I do think we're going to see an evolution away from traditional, pure fee-for-service contracting to \u2013 contracting it for example, is going to look more like systems outside the U.S. where there has to be a demonstration of efficacy for a drug or there has to be a demonstration of value for reimbursement for a test.","And these are things that we need to anticipate, because although they will be slower to develop than we think they are, I do think, they're the long-term future of how providers like us are going to get paid.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, helpful. I'm sorry, Glenn, go ahead?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","No. Just on your other question on the share repo in the guidance, what we did say is that, the guidance range that we have provided for our free cash flow that, our guidance does assume that we will fully redeploy that.","And we said in the combination expected, but it's in our guidance, expect that, that will be a combination of M&A kind of tuck-ins, if you will, share repurchases and debt reduction. We ended the year at 3.2 times leverage in 2017, so we would expect to bring down the leverage a bit, but we also expect to use a fair amount of that free cash flow to both M&A and share repurchases.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to talk a bit about the components of margin expansion as we think about 2018 and beyond. Certainly, the CRO with accelerating revenue growth and LaunchPad probably has some opportunities for improvement versus the Diagnostic asset which you're already exiting under the three-year LaunchPad phase. You have the pricing reductions from PAMA. So maybe just, how we should be thinking about holistically the margins of the segment, and how that rolls up to the enterprise in the near-term?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Hi, Nick, this is Glenn. Let me at least take a first cut at it. Your observation is pretty good. If you look at it by business, within the Drug Development side, we expect to see improving margins, both due to the strength of the demand that we're seeing and expect to see in 2018 and beyond, as well as now embracing kind of the LaunchPad initiative where we've talked about kind of the incremental $130 million of net savings that we expect over the next three years.","So we are expecting to see good margin improvement. And as John has commented before, relative to where we were against some of our competitors, there was also some room to see that pick up as well. So we're really encouraged there.","The flip side obviously on the Diagnostics is that, we enjoy very strong operating margins. We've benefited from the LaunchPad initiative, frankly, over the last three years that are reflected in the margin. But as you know in 2018, we've begun to get the headwinds of the PAMA legislation that will be constraining our margins.","So we do expect that Diagnostics margins will be down kind of in 2018, and then obviously based upon what ultimately occurs with PAMA over the next few years could be additional headwinds going beyond. So as we start-off as an enterprise though, we're looking that, over time to continue to see some margin improvement. The first year in 2018 will be difficult given the quickness of the PAMA starting without the long-term benefit of the LaunchPad initiative kicking in. But were it not for the PAMA headwind, we would have expected even in 2018 for enterprise margins to be up.","And frankly, even with the new revenue recognition accounting that's come in place, there will be a little bit of a constraint on the margin, even though we've restated the prior period, because of the acquisition of Chiltern will have on for a full-year in 2018. But overall, we continue to look for ways to maximize our operating margins as we go forward. And while we talk about the LaunchPad initiative within Covance, from our perspective, there's still an ongoing initiative within Drug Development to continue to improve operating margins.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And as my follow-up, it's maybe for you, Dave, in terms of the consumer strategy you guys have been pursuing over the last 12 to 24 months. Certainly, things like Walgreens relationship, certainly things like 23andMe, maybe just look at holistically where those stand today relative to where you think is in terms of contributors in 2018, 2019 and beyond? Where are we in terms of the process of seeing further acceleration in organic growth as these platforms become more bigger parts of the pie? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. Obviously, with 23andMe we've got a long-standing collaboration, and their growth in volume has been quite significant. So we're obviously very pleased that their volume is growing, what we're talking to them now about is other things that can be added to complement that collaboration, such as offering routine testing to consumers through a combination of our capabilities, they're people ordering genetic tests or have ordered genetic tests, and them now having the opportunity to do direct ordering of routine testing.","We have a whole variety of things that we're talking about as ideas that we would like to pursue for expanding our reach to the consumer. With Walgreens, obviously we're in the very early innings with seven stores open, we have a plan for significant expansion next year.","But we also want to think about Walgreens as not just we want to expand the patient service center footprint of being more convenient spaces but we want to expand the constellation of capabilities around the combination of drugstore and lab, which again is why we always have insisted that we wanted our consumer channel to be in a healthcare setting.","So how do we help the pharmacist practice at the top of the license with things like Medication Therapy Management, and even test ordering in some states. How do we introduce the Covance piece into Walgreens as a patient engagement and patient recruitment tool? How do we use the LabCorp patient database in terms of demographics and diagnoses with the Walgreens patient database in terms of medication that a patient is taking? There are a lot of opportunities there.","And so, we not only think about scaling the footprint, but we think about scaling the collaboration and thinking about other retail settings where that's potentially an opportunity for us. In summary, our consumer strategy is focused on not telling the consumer you have to come see us where we are, but meeting the consumer where they want to be met. And you'll see us increasingly pursue that through mobile, through digital, through footprint in the years ahead.","Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys. See you in a couple weeks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys, obviously a healthy book-to-bill in the quarter, so I'm curious how we should think about revenue conversion given the moving parts of the backlog with Chiltern coming in. How will that pace out in 2018? And then, I know you talked about cancellations being stable. So how comfortable are you with the security of the backlog? I mean, are you expecting the same level of cancellations going forward as recent historical numbers?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","This is John, Patrick. And so, we have within the 2018 guidance, basically organic revenue growth of the mid to high-single-digits; and then obviously the acceleration of the Chiltern. The backlog is based on a contracted basis.","So it's as clean as you can possibly get in terms of the rigid discipline that goes into that backlog. Obviously, anytime you have a penetration more and more in the small-medium category, you do get a little bit higher cancellation rate, but at the same time, you get a higher level of growth. 75% of the molecules are there. They have a higher level of R&D funding, and the increase is actually higher than the small and medium, but backlog very stable and strong underneath growth from the conversion.","I think, you're also seeing that just in terms of 2017, with the cancellations that we had at the very end of 2016, you went through the first half trough to basically slightly positive in Q3, and then to the mid \u2013 low to mid-single-digit growth in fourth, plus we've got outstanding fourth quarter orders, where we picked up the last 12 months, the 1.36 from the 1.33 or the 1.23, or the 1.15 earlier. You're just seeing the resonation of our strategic investments in the team, the technology capabilities utilizing LabCorp patient data to win awards, and then the solutions that come from that, the companion diagnostics.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And maybe just a quick one on the deal pipeline, I mean, should we expect you guys to focus more on the lab business with CROs, I mean, I presume valuations in labs have pulled back maybe around PAMA, but curious as to your take there?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Patrick, it's Dave. We evaluate a lot of deals, and we evaluate everyone based on strategic and business fit. So we have said with regard to the CRO, that the flawless integration of Chiltern is the top priority and it remains a top priority. Nonetheless, we'll look at every deal that comes along and see what's the best fit for the business given the needs.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate on the organic revenue growth expectations for LabCorp Diagnostics in 2018?","Gary M. Huff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Hi, Dan. This is Gary. Yes, we're really pleased with the organic growth that we achieved in the fourth quarter as well as for the year. We have a focus on that. We've been focusing on organic growth, and the growth was very broad based. And as Dave mentioned earlier, it wasn't in just a few segments, it was in several segments, but also across all geographies. We will continue to drive our organic growth into 2018. We were happy with it in 2017, but we're not satisfied, and you will continue to see us have more of an intense focus on organic growth.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","And Dan, it's Dave. I think, you should remember in terms of organic growth that revenue was going to be constrained by about that 1% per PAMA that we mentioned, so whenever that top line revenue growth would be, we actually have about a 1% headwind going in. I would expect organic volume growth to be relatively consistent with this year, so that hopefully gives you some framework.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, and just a quick housekeeping follow-up. Possibly you could be specific on the Chiltern revenue contribution in the fourth quarter?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","I think we gave you $550 million for Chiltern for the full-year. And so that should give you an indication in terms of the fourth quarter. We're not getting into this segment-by-segment guidance and\/or delineation, but that should give you a guide.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Hong Tran - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. This is actually Hong on for Erin. Thanks for taking the question. Just one quick one for us on the CRO business. I know you guys disclosed that you expect roughly $2.8 billion of your backlog to be converted over the next 12 months. And that would imply roughly a 70% backlog coverage for the year. What visibility do you have into bookings for sort of the remaining revenues that aren't currently booked or just more generally how are they shaping up into the quarter or 2018?","John D. Ratliff - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","This is John. And so, I think, from the standpoint of \u2013 we're seeing continued momentum within the order rate. You do have with us \u2013 having early development, central labs, clinical development, you do have that mix of the business that converts backlog into revenue faster within the early development, and to another degree in terms of the labs.","So that $2.9 billion is consistent with the prior quarter attainment. And so there's fair stability there, but more so on the order rate in 2018. We're seeing the continued momentum across the businesses, whether that's Chiltern accelerating a clinical \u2013 or a legacy clinical Covance, whether that's the strength of the labs. And I think you're seeing that in the second half of even 2017.","And then early development even, and that's across the board whether that's in BioA, CMC or in the safety assessment, metabolic lead optimization areas. So good visibility, good momentum in terms of the balance of what the bookings need to be in terms of attaining the guidance that we've given.","Hong Tran - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then just one follow-up. Where do we stand now in terms of sort of your ability to better monetize that lab data for this year?","Scott Frommer - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Erin (sic) [Hong], I'm sorry. I'm going to ask you to jump back in. That's your third question. We still have a number of people in the queue.","Hong Tran - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. No problem.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you can give a little bit more detail on how much reinvestment you've baked in from tax reform. It look like you've pulled a majority of the benefit down to the bottom line. But I think, in your prepared remarks, you talked about reinvestment in people and infrastructure. So hoping you can split that out for us. And then maybe expectation of any incremental labor cost pressure going forward just given the backdrop, and what your estimate is of wage cost growth going ahead. Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. It's Dave. So without specifically detailing the use of the tax benefit, one, as you saw in the guidance, we are accelerating some capital investments in the business. And that's IT, that's infrastructure, that's patient engagement capability. There's a whole variety of investments to support future growth.","The second thing, we talked about investing in our people, so that would be in the context of a one-time bonus to all of our non-bonus eligible employees that will be paid this year based on length of service. And that will be formally detailed at the time that we actually pay, which will be in March. So those are the ways, Ralph, in which we intend to deploy the investments in the business and in the people from tax reform.","The wage costs now, obviously, we're in a tight labor market at the same time. As we look at this bonus based on length of service, the number of people who are long-serving employees in our business among our 57,000 colleagues is actually very, very significant. And so we have a lot of stability in the workforce. We think about wage rate inflation as sort of being in the 3% range, and that's how we sketch it out for the future.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open.","Per Ostlund - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning. This is Per Ostlund on for Kevin today. I wanted to follow-up to, I think, it was Patrick's question earlier regarding M&A. And, Dave, I can appreciate your looking at opportunities across your business. But to the extent that you're looking at labs specifically, does the sort of ongoing uncertainty with PAMA, kind of, keep those discussions in a holding pattern or sort of how would you characterize those discussions that you're having today? And then, I guess, related to that. What is your current viewpoint on the litigation that's going on with CMS and\/or any potential legislative relief that the industry is pursuing? Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. So the pipeline continues to be robust. At the same time, I'm not sure that the impact of PAMA has been fully realized, particularly in \u2013 I was with a large health system CEO last week. And without getting into a lot of detail, I don't think the impact of PAMA on the laboratory operations of the large health system has necessarily been fully filled yet in the executive suites. So I think that we're going to continue to be thoughtful about how we deploy capital toward our acquisitions across the board, and whether PAMA has an impact on that deal pipeline, I think will emerge throughout the year.","On the litigation, we have a briefing schedule that would call for all of the papers to be filed with the court in April, by mid-April. The case has been assigned to Judge Sullivan, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, many, many years ago. I appeared in front of him. He's an excellent Judge, and I think he will give us a very thoughtful evaluation.","And I would just say, we continue to feel that we have a very persuasive case that CMS and the data collection process \u2013 sorry in the process of promulgating a rule that led to the data collection did not comply with the specific language of the PAMA statute. So obviously, we're optimistic that one, we'll have a decision by sort of the June timeframe, and two, that we'll win the case. We continue to seek a legislative solution as well to engage with CMS. And we'll see how it develops.","Per Ostlund - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Just a super-quick one, I know, one you've been asked a lot as well. But any updates on the United situation just in terms of when we might hear kind of what's going on there?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Amanda, it's Dave. We've had accelerated pace of engagement with United over the last month-and-a-half. The teams are very much engaged, at my level, at Gary's level, and also at the negotiating team level. And I'm optimistic that we will reach an understanding in a reasonably short timeframe now.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Yeah, just a couple of follow-up questions. First of all, Dave, just to clarify on United, so you're talking about accelerated conversation. So should we assume that there's no RFP that's going to be issued; that's one. And second one, if you can just kind of talk a little bit about the benefit that you are seeing from the flu season, is that incorporated into your guidance and how it impacted the quarter?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Sure. Obviously, we're a partner with United, but we don't dictate their process, so I can't comment on what their process may or may not entail. I can just say that, we've had accelerated pace of discussions, in my mind very constructive discussions, and I'm hoping that, as I say, we'll reach some sort of a resolution in a relatively short timeframe.","In terms of the flu, as everybody knows, we are experiencing an unusually virulent flu season. On the other hand, most of the flu testing that's done is actually point-of-service testing or near-patient testing, it's not reference testing. We did see an increase in flu testing referred to us, but it is not significant enough to have any impact on our results.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick follow-up, Dave, on that last question from Ricky, and I guess, you're certainly recognizing that you guys don't see a lot of direct business as you pointed out, it's often at the point-of-service. Is there any metrics you can talk about because the hospital \u2013 the associated hospital admission rates have been up affiliated with the flu. I'm just curious if you're seeing any sort of ancillary benefit to LabCorp deduction there (58:36). Thanks.","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Good morning, Bill. It's Dave. I think it'd be hard for us to identify any ancillary benefit, obviously everybody has read about the increase in hospital admission rates and the pressure on emergency rooms from flu. But it's very unlikely that, that's going to generate any material amount of reference testing for us.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up from me, too; I understand you don't want to give the specific Chiltern contribution in the quarter. But just to help us triangulate a little bit, on the $550 million that you did this year, the run rate on that would be just right below $140 million on a quarterly basis. Just trying to triangulate, it looks like you probably did better than that, call it $140 million run rate in Q4. Is that a fair assumption?","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Tim, this is Glenn. I mean, I think how John characterized it is fair, is that we are tracking to roughly that annualized number, maybe slightly ahead of it, but comparable. So if you're trying to back into kind of the organic growth rate just by taking that as a proxy for the quarter will get you to kind of a mid-kind of organic growth rate for the business, and again, accelerating as we get into 2018.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Did you say mid-single-digit organic growth rate? Is that what you just said? I'm sorry.","Glenn A. Eisenberg - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","That's right, with the benefit of the currency translation. You'll be able to back into the number. But what we've commented about for the quarter organically, again, based upon, as John characterized it, by backing up the Chiltern pro rata for the time we've owned it would get you to roughly a mid-single-digit number with the benefit of currency translation, and then that increasing as we go into 2018.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Just one from me, so I guess, when I think about the sort of the project LaunchPad at Covance over the next three years producing, I think, you said $130 million of efficiencies, how much of that is kind of investments in digital capabilities around clinical trials like developing your own tools there?","Obviously, you have tools around enrollments, but sort of adding new tools around monitoring and adaptive studies and things of that nature? Is that on the sort of the horizon to drive margin expansion for you guys, or are you going to rely on third-party vendors?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","It's Dave. So as we said, LaunchPad \u2013 and by the way, it's $130 million incremental, so it's $150 million total over the timeframe. But LaunchPad is both right-sizing and re-engineering, and we did basically the bulk of the right-sizing last year. The reengineering is investment in tools and technologies. It's expanding our Xcellerate platform. It's endpoint. It's PHARMACUITY. It's a number of the other tools that we have developed that are proprietary tools for study start-up, for site monitoring, for remote medical monitoring, for whole variety of start-up and trial management capabilities.","And we are going to continue to invest in those and enhance them, and expand our capabilities in digital. And obviously, some of it will be with partners, and some of it will be our own internal efforts. But Covance LaunchPad is about \u2013 it fits into our long-term strategy that we talked about our second point, which is streamlining and optimizing the Drug Development process.","Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Dave, you called out organic volumes were driven in part by women's health. Can you just speak to the NIPT franchise and how Sequenom is doing and then, maybe any expectations you might have on average risk prenatal testing volumes later this year?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yeah, Sequenom is doing terrific. Obviously, it's in the run rate now. We're continuing to see very steady growth. We are continuing to add capabilities to the testing platform, which was one of the reasons why we felt Sequenom was such an attractive opportunity for us. And we are winning business in the OB\/GYN office because of our one-stop capabilities.","In terms of average risk, that's obviously a controversial area in terms of coverage. So there's been some improvement in payer recognition of the value of NIPT for average risk. And we continue to advocate for NIPT and average risk in the average risk population, as obviously do others. So we're hopeful that we'll continue to make progress, but at the same time, it is an area in which the payers are concerned about the escalation of the expense, and they want to be very thoughtful as they make their coverage decisions.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And just as a follow-up, can you speak to your interest level in liquid biopsies? Obviously, there's a lot of buzz in the industry on the Diagnostics side. But in particular, related to therapy selection and late-stage use in oncology?","David P. King - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings","Yes. So we have a number of liquid biopsy projects ongoing. We have a liquid biopsy project ongoing that's actually a part of trials at Covance. There was some liquid biopsy development that was ongoing at Sequenom's R&D that we've revitalized to look at opportunities there.","Long-term, I think liquid biopsy is a great opportunity for our industry for exactly the same reason that NIPT was, which is, it takes a procedure that is costly, that involves an invasive procedure and that involves some risk to the patient as well as risks that you're going to miss the critical things you're looking for, which is if you do a prostate punch biopsy, you may miss the cancer in the prostate because you didn't get the right cells and turns it into something that looks for cancer cells in a non-invasive way with a high degree of certainty that we're actually capturing what we're looking for.","So it took \u2013 I remember, the first time we were presented with the idea of fetal cell sorting, which became NIPT, it was in the early 2000s. And it took over ten years for the technology to be perfected. And we see liquid biopsy as the same type of opportunity, long-term, game-changing, near-term definitely something to be looking at.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thank you.","David P.

My name is Sean, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David King, Chairman and CEO. Please proceed, sir.","David P. King","Thank you, Sean. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today from LabCorp are: Brad Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ed Dodson, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Steve Anderson, Vice President, Investor Relations.","This morning, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results, provide 2013 guidance, highlight our progress on our Five Pillar Strategy and provide answers to several frequently asked questions.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Anderson, who has a few comments before we begin.","Stephen Anderson","Before we get started, I would like to point out that there will be a replay of this conference call available via the telephone and Internet. Please refer to today's press release for replay information.","This morning, the company filed a Form 8-K that included additional information on our business and operations. This information is also available on our website. Analysts and investors are directed to this 8-K and our website to review this supplemental information.","Additionally, we refer you to today's press release, which is available on our website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call to GAAP. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted EPS, adjusted EPS excluding amortization, free cash flow and adjusted operating income.","I would also like to point out that we are making forward-looking statements during this conference call. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about our expected financial results, the implementation of our business strategy and the ongoing benefits from acquisitions. These statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to change based upon various factors that could affect the company's financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our 2011 10-K and will be in our 2012 10-K and subsequent filings. The company has no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements, even if our expectations change.","Now Brad Hayes will review our financial results.","William B. Hayes","Thank you, Steve. On today's call, I will review 4 key measures of our financial performance: cash flow, revenue growth, margin and liquidity. I'll also provide our 2013 guidance.","First, cash flow. Our cash flow remains strong. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2012, was $667.6 million. Free cash flow was below our expectations as a result of lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending. Operating cash flow was lower in part due to payment to certain key vendors to take advantage of favorable economics, as well as the negative impact due to weather. Also operating cash flow was reduced by a one-time out-of-period adjustment of $34 million related to a balance sheet reclassification between cash and accounts payable. Without this adjustment, 2012 operating cash flow would have been $875 million.","Certain capital expenditures were made in the fourth quarter to take advantage of favorable economics. These factors are included in our 2013 guidance. DSO was 46 days at the end of December, a decrease of 2 days sequentially and flat year-over-year. During the quarter, our bad debt rate was 4.3%.","Second, revenue growth. Revenue increased 2.9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, total company volume increased 2.8%. Organic volume increased 0.7% year-over-year, adjusted for the impact of inclement weather, which we estimate reduced volume growth by approximately 1% during the quarter. Revenue per requisition was essentially flat year-over-year.","Third, margin. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating income margin was 17.2% compared to 18.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012. We estimate that inclement weather lowered margin by approximately 80 basis points during the quarter.","Fourth, liquidity. We remain well capitalized. At the end of December, we had cash of $466.8 million and no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion credit facility. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $136 million of stock, representing 1.6 million shares. For the full year, we repurchased $516.4 million of stock, representing 5.9 million shares. At the end of December, $68 million of repurchase authorization remained under our share repurchase program.","This morning, we announced that LabCorp's Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. Further, as part of our updated capital allocation strategy that we announced last month, we will raise our leverage ratio to 2.5x debt to EBITDA over time. This strategy reflects our continued commitment to return capital to and create value for our shareholders through acquisitions and share repurchase.","This morning, we announced our 2013 financial guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of approximately 2% to 3%; adjusted EPS excluding amortization of $6.85 to $7.15, which includes a negative impact of approximately $0.35 due to Medicare payment reductions, and which excludes the impact of any share repurchase activity after December 31, 2012; operating cash flow of approximately $870 million to $900 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $200 million to $220 million. Our capital expenditure guidance is higher than historical levels due to near-term investments in facility consolidation and replacement of a major testing platform.","I will now turn the call over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Brad. We are pleased with our performance, given that we continue to face a very difficult operating environment.","During 2012, we grew revenue 2.3%. We grew adjusted EPS excluding amortization by 7.1%. We continued to generate strong operating and free cash flow, which we invested in the business and returned to shareholders through share purchase. We repurchased $516 million of our stock, representing 5.9 million of our shares. And we kept a tight lid on expenses, measurably reducing our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.","We continue to make progress on each aspect of our Five Pillar Strategy. The first pillar of our strategy is that we deploy capital to investments that enhance our business and return capital to shareholders. Last month, we announced a target leverage ratio of 2.5x debt to EBITDA, which all other things being equal, we intend to achieve over time. We expect to continue to deploy our capital toward acquisitions and share repurchase. Over the last several years, we have deployed our free cash flow almost evenly between acquisitions and share repurchase. Going forward, we would expect to deploy our free cash flow similarly. And in the absence of sizable acquisition opportunities, we anticipate deploying our additional leverage largely towards share repurchase.","The second pillar of our strategy is to enhance our IT capabilities to improve the physician and patient experience. As planned, we completed the nationwide rollout of our Beacon Patient Portal in Q4, which is now available to all patients in right-to-know states. The portal is a secure and easy-to-use online solution that enables patients to receive and share lab results, make appointments, pay bills, set up automatic alerts and notifications, and manage health information for the entire family. We experienced fast adoption of the portal in 2012 and are now seeing accelerated growth as we enter 2013, adding more than 1,000 new patient registrations per day. The Patient Portal is a valuable tool that allows patients to better manage their health care, and we will expand its capabilities over time.","Our electronic medical record connectivity continues to expand. We added over 8,200 new client EMR interfaces in 2012, and we are setting the bar higher for 2013. We remain committed to our open platform strategy, allowing our customers to connect seamlessly to LabCorp directly or via the EMR of their choice.","We piloted a number of new population health analytics modules during the fourth quarter to provide health care business intelligence tools to hospitals, physician practices and ACOs. These tools assist customers in their compliance in reporting requirements with respect to efficient management of their productivity, quality and patient outcome metrics. The company's robust rules engine maintains more than 600 clinical quality measures that are highly customizable and provide full compliance with meaningful use requirements and ACO, JCO and PQRS reporting requirements. Real-time clinical alerts highlight gaps in care for patients and patient populations. These industry-leading, data-driven services position LabCorp as a trusted partner to health care stakeholders, providing the knowledge to optimize decision-making, improve health outcomes and reduce treatment costs.","The third pillar of our strategy is to continue to improve efficiency to offer the most compelling value in laboratory services. During the fourth quarter, we implemented our Propel robotic technology in our primary Burlington lab. Over time, we expect this technology to replace manual splitting and sorting throughout our major laboratories, enhancing efficiency and increasing quality. We look forward to providing updates on our Propel initiative over the next several quarters.","We also made significant progress in the rollout of the VANTAGE positive ID system, which is now implemented in more than 90% of our core histology sites. This system standardizes workflow, eliminates waste and positively identifies specimens throughout processing. We completed the rollout of our new handheld courier communication devices during the quarter. This enhancement provides greater visibility into specimen collection, enables more accurate route engineering and increases courier efficiency. Finally, given the persistently challenging environment, we continue to review and rationalize our cost structure.","The fourth pillar of our strategy is to continue scientific innovation at reasonable and appropriate pricing. We introduce new tests and collaborate with leading companies and academic institutions to provide physicians and patients with the most scientifically advanced testing in our industry.  During the fourth quarter, we launched a program to assist clinicians in the screening, assessment, diagnosis, confirmation and management of cardiovascular-related disorders. The program uses LabCorp Beacon for test orders, result delivery, analytics and trending, and a cardiovascular disease risk assessment for lipid analysis. This decision support tool is provided by our Litholink division, which focuses on chronic disease management.","As we discussed last quarter, the rapid evolution of next-generation sequencing technology is enhancing our molecular diagnostics testing. Consistent with these enhancements, we are launching the GeneSeq cardio test, which allows us to identify more than 90 genetic causes of familial cardiac disease through next-generation sequencing methods. We believe that next -- that GeneSeq cardio will be a usual prognostic tool to identify positive family history and symptoms of cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, aortopathy, Noonan syndrome, congenital heart disease and early-onset coronary artery disease. This testing will help establish and confirm the diagnosis of familial cardiac disease and identify the need for regular cardiac screening, lifestyle changes or intervention to prevent progression of cardiac complications. Additional clinical utility could include the identification of first-degree relatives who have inherited a disease-causing genetic variant and may be at risk for myocardial infarction, stroke or sudden cardiac death.","The fifth pillar of our strategy is to develop alternative delivery models. As we have said, there are fundamental changes taking place in our industry. We see health care moving toward large health systems, integrated delivery networks, accountable care organizations, patient-centered medical homes and mega physician practices. We also see managed care companies organizing ACOs and buying physician practices. Our capabilities provide an end-to-end lab solution for these customers, meeting the requirements of new care models with population health management tools, decision-support programs, patient counseling, integrated clinical reports and patient-centric data solutions. These offerings are focused around IT, but it is the completeness of our solution for lab needs that differentiates LabCorp and provides value for our customers.","Our BeaconLBS platform is a point-of-care, decision-support service that interfaces with test ordering systems to help guide physicians in lab and test selection. Physicians, patients, health care delivery systems and payors will benefit from this innovation, which will improve quality and more effectively manage costs without disrupting physician workflow. Our rules engine interfaces with provider and payor policies for ordering, utilization, adjudication and payment. Our pilot programs are going well as BeaconLBS continues to receive high marks for its ease of use and its ability to help practices enhance patient care.","Health systems provide adequate lab services, but most of these businesses make a small profit or operate at a loss. Changes in test mix, reduced reimbursement for government and private payors, and cost inflation continue to pressure health systems, and thus they are increasingly interested in broad collaborations. Because of our scale, we offer a broader menu of tests more affordably for patients and payors, and the ability to maintain the highest levels of quality and service to health systems and the community they serve.","We will continue to pursue these collaborations to offer an enterprise-wide solution that provides health systems, patients, physicians and payors with the highest-quality diagnostic testing through the lowest-cost delivery model. As health care reform continues to evolve, we will continue to focus on providing all of our customers with the highest value for their laboratory spend, improving quality, reducing costs and improving outcomes.","In summary, we are pleased with our performance and the progress we achieved on our Five Pillar Strategy this year. Now Steve Anderson will review anticipated questions and our specific answers to those questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Stephen Anderson","Thank you, Dave. \"Can you describe the impact of Medicare payment cuts you will face in 2013?\"","The Affordable Care Act baseline for the 2013 update to the clinical lab fee schedule was negative 0.95%. And the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act rebaselined the fee schedule an additional 2% lower. These fee schedule reductions became effective on January 1, 2013. If mandatory sequestration is implemented, we will receive an additional 2% reduction to the clinical lab fee schedule and a separate 2% reduction to the physician fee schedule, effective April 1, 2013. We also face significant impacts as a result of a variety of other government payment reductions, including the reduction to CPT code 88305 and the full year impact of the TC Grandfather Clause. Summed together, we estimate that these payment reductions will lower our 2013 EPS by approximately $0.35.","\"Why is the midpoint of your initial 2013 EPS guidance approximately $0.25 below consensus?\"","Our guidance encompasses a wide range of potential outcomes, and we are just beginning 2013. We continue to note that the diluted share counts in analyst estimates differ considerably from our own and from each other. In reviewing these forecasts, we note that the average share count across sell-side models implies a $0.17 benefit in 2013 from share repurchase. As we stated in our press release this morning, our guidance excludes the impact of share repurchase, effective after December 31, 2012. Further, as I noted in my previous comments, we face several Medicare reductions in 2013. It appears that most analysts did not model the full impact of these reductions in their 2013 estimates as we projected the negative impact of the major 2013 Medicare reductions at $0.22 on our third quarter conference call, $0.13 lower than the full projected impact of the 2013 Medicare reductions that we described this morning.","\"Why are capital expenditures so high in 2013?\"","We typically spend approximately 3% of revenue on capital expenditures. As Brad previously mentioned, our capital expenditure increase in 2013 is driven by near-term investments in facility consolidation and replacement of a major testing platform.","\"Can you update us on the mix of your business coming from esoteric testing?\"","For the year, approximately 40% of our revenues were in the genomic, esoteric and anatomic pathology categories. As we reiterated last quarter, our goal is to increase our esoteric test mix to approximately 45% of our revenue within the next 3 to 5 years.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave.","David P. King","Thank you, Steve. And thank you very much for listening. We are now ready to take your questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci, Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess, I had 2 questions. The first one was sort of on the '13 outlook. Obviously, Medicare is a big negative. But I'm wondering what -- if you could highlight some of the positive drivers that overcome some of the pressures on the business as you look out. I know in the past, you've talked about Genzyme and MEDTOX and [indiscernible], et cetera, sort of ramping up. Is that still the case? So if you could just explore some of the positives versus the negatives as we think about the '13 moving parts.","William B. Hayes","Tom, it's Brad. I'd like to say a couple of things to answer your question. One is, obviously, we face the Medicare cuts that we described and you referred to. Secondly, we have some offset of those cuts from increases in payment from other payor types that are nongovernment. So there's one thing that helps to offset. We also have continued acquisition integration from Genzyme and some of the other acquisitions that we've done since that date that also help to offset. Given the 2% to 3% top line revenue guidance, we still think of it as a low organic growth environment, which is what I think keeps some of the positives from offsetting the negative from the payment reduction.","David P. King","And Tom, it's Dave. Just to add one further point. We're encouraged that organic volume growth increased sequentially from 3Q to 4Q. So we have some cautious optimism that we're going to see better organic volume growth as we go forward through 2013.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And in that 2% to 3% you mentioned, Brad, there's small acquisitions in there as you normally would have, maybe a 0.5% or 1% or so?","William B. Hayes","Not really. I mean, just the annualized impact of MEDTOX and some of the smaller ones that we did in 2012.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. So nothing new or incremental that you haven't done yet in terms of top line that would add to the top line?","William B. Hayes","No.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. That's good. And then just I guess, a big-picture question. I don't know if you want to take a stab at it, Dave. But obviously for a lot of health care these days, thinking about health care reform in 2014 and beyond has become a lot of the focus for investors. So any updated thoughts on how reform will impact your company and your industry?","David P. King","Tom, I think reform will be a net positive to us. There are a lot of moving parts. And some of them, such as how will the exchanges actually work, what will pricing be through the exchanges and how many states will actually participate in Medicaid expansion, remain unclear at this point. But at a high level, I think we will see volume growth, offset to some extent by reduced pricing on the business that is coming through the company now that is uninsured that will be subject to insurance rates and a net benefit from reduction in the bad debt rate. So we view it as a net positive. But again a lot of moving pieces and too early to try to even begin to quantify it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby, Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave or Brad, does the larger share repurchase authorization suggest any kind of moratorium on acquisitions near-term or any kind of comment on deal pricing that you're seeing?","David P. King","Bob, it's Dave. It does not suggest a moratorium on acquisition activity. The pipeline remains quite active. The share repurchase commitment and the board's endorsement of the $1 billion in share repurchase authorization reflects more our continued commitment to using share repurchase as a way to return capital to shareholders.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just another broader question, who are you talking to now with your greater kind of technology and electronic connectivity that you weren't talking to previously? Is there somebody out there vastly more intrigued with your data connectivity now?","David P. King","Bob, it's Dave. I would say the increasing prevalence of ACOs and mega physician practice groups that are thinking about transitioning to an environment in which they either share risk or take risk has made them a lot more interested in population health management and data analytics. Obviously, a lot of people are working on population health management and data analytics. One of the great benefits that we have is the enormous amount of information and data that we have on the unique patients that we see every year and the longitudinal database that we have on those same patients as they come back to see us over time. So I think as we continue to see the development of ACOs, the consolidation of physician practices and even the consolidation of health systems, the value of those data analytics will continue to increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So this has been the strongest volume you have reported, I think, back -- if I go back since 2001. So can you just share with us a little bit more about what's the contribution from acquisitions in the quarter? How big was MEDTOX in the numbers and if there's anything else? And then what are you seeing overall in the marketplace? Are you taking share? Or are you seeing just overall an improved environment?","William B. Hayes","Ricky, this is Brad. On the volume side, there's a significant contribution from MEDTOX. We had that for a full quarter in the fourth quarter as opposed to 2\/3 of the quarter in the third. So that is a significant contributor. But still as we look beyond that, as we pointed out and Dave mentioned a second ago, too, adjusted for weather, because that was about 1 point drag on the volume growth, we still saw organic volume in the quarter of 0.7%. And sequentially, that is better than we saw in Q3 and any other quarter, I believe, of 2012. So on the volume side, a lot from MEDTOX but some organic there as well.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And when you think about organically, are you growing with the market? Or do you think that you're taking share?","David P. King","Ricky, it's Dave. That's a very difficult question to answer just because it's hard to know how the market is growing. I think we're growing with the market. I will say we continue to see in our patient and physician satisfaction surveys very strong satisfaction with the quality of our service level. And I think that, that is a very important aspect of why organic volume has increased sequentially.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just break down for us the weather impact of -- I think it was about $13 million to the EBIT line by cost of goods and SG&A?","William B. Hayes","Yes. Ricky, this is Brad. Really, when we think about the weather impact, the only costs that are involved are our supply cost, the direct variable cost of the testing, as well as bad debt. So the supply cost would be in cost of goods, the bad debt would be in SG&A.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And we can assume just the bad debt that's kind of at the corporate level?","William B. Hayes","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman, Wells Fargo.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you discuss any impact at all that you've seen on the competition from the reimbursement cuts, either from a business perspective or a willingness to try to go after acquisitions?","David P. King","Gary, it's Dave. Obviously, the reimbursement impact hits all laboratories and indeed hits hospitals that perform Medicare laboratory services as well. The biggest impact we've seen in the marketplace is in the anatomic pathology-focused specialty businesses simply because as you recognize from Steve's commentary, the clinical lab fee schedule, the physician fee schedule and the 88305 reduction all have a direct impact on them. So the entire industry has been affected by this. And I think we're seeing some of the smaller and some of the specialty players be more cognizant of the opportunity to monetize their businesses than maybe they were earlier in 2012.","Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just in terms of thinking about the additional leverage that you guys plan to take on. I mean, it would indicate a fairly sizable dollar amount. So it would seem like it would leave you more than enough capital to do share purchases at, at least the rate that you've been for the past year or so and also acquisitions. So is there anything specific or general that you're thinking you're going to use it for and, I guess, the timing in terms of how long you think it's going to take you to increase the leverage?","David P. King","Obviously, we don't guide to our share repurchase activity. And so I want to make sure that nobody's interpreting this as giving guidance on our share repurchase activity. As I said in the prepared comments, if you look at the last 5 years, it's been almost exactly half of our free cash flow to acquisitions and half to share repurchase. And going forward, we would expect to deploy our free cash flow similarly, about half to acquisitions and half to share repurchase. The additional leverage that we've talked about, by and large, and again all other things being equal in the absence of sizable acquisition opportunities, we would expect the additional leverage to be deployed toward share purchase. We don't have a specific time frame for when we would achieve the target leverage largely because, going back to your last question, the acquisition market is very active, the environment is very fluid. And so we're going to be strategic about how we deploy that additional leverage and how we reach the leverage point over time.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor, Citigroup.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As I kind of do my math on the volume, I just want to see if you agree with this. So reported 2.8%, I guess, really would have been 3.8% adding back the weather. And then you're saying 0.7% of that is organic. So MEDTOX and other deals added about 3.1% year-over-year?","David P. King","Gary, it's Dave. The only observation I would make on that is -- and I don't mean to split hairs. But some of that 1% that we lost due to weather would have been organic as well. So your numbers are close. I don't think there is a material difference there. But as reported, if you don't take account of that 1%, then I would agree with you, 0.7% organic and the rest, acquisitions. I think some of that 1% would have been driven by organic growth as well.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. It's a fair point. I guess, what I'm interested in is you had commented that the underlying organic was better sequentially. And I see that as well. But shouldn't we believe that the very widespread flu activity and presumably physician office activity might have contributed to some of that sequential improvement and maybe not to read too much into that heading into '13?","David P. King","It's Dave again. I mean, far be it from me to suggest how you should interpret the data. The only thing that I will say is our business is not driven by flu. Most of the flu that we test for at all is going to be rapid point-of-care testing in patient service centers. As you probably know, most rapid flu testing is done in physician offices and is not sent out. So my view is the flu season really doesn't have an impact, a strong impact one way or the other. But again that's my view. And you may have a different view of how to interpret the data.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And for Brad, on the amortization acceleration, I assume that, that's in the amortization line, but that -- if we exclude that, that means kind of the recurring amortization number drops to $17 million, which looks low. Is that the right quarterly run rate into '13?","William B. Hayes","Gary, the $6.2 million is in the number for the amortization. And I think some things are rolling off. So generally, amortization is coming down as some things get fully amortized. But again since that's a number that we add back for our adjusted EPS in the way we guide and the way we report, it's interesting, but I don't think it affects our guidance or our results.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, I guess, I'm thinking the run rate amortization has been roughly $21 million. If we exclude the $6 million this quarter, it was $17 million. So that lower run rate, it sounds like it carries into '13 because things are rolling off.","William B. Hayes","Yes. And the only thing I'll add to that not being exactly the way to extrapolate it is, as we do the acquisitions and there are adjustments to amortizations, as we get final valuations and things of that nature, those go into that line as well.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question. I guess, absent from the Medicare headwinds you outlined were some of the changes to the molecular diagnostic payments that obviously are coming out of the Palmetto fee schedule that a lot of us have been trying to compare apples-to-apples and understand what's being paid for and not paid for, et cetera. And it seems like there is a headwind there but not something that you explicitly identified today. Do you want -- can you comment on that a little more?","David P. King","Gary, it's Dave. First of all, as we have consistently said, only about 4% to 5% of our total revenue base is impacted by the Medicare molecular Dx coding changes. And molecular Dx is about 6% of the total revenue base. We have been saying all along that we did not expect a material impact. And in fact, we expect these Medicare repricing and molecular codes to be a slight positive for us. We're continuing to discuss the appropriate payment rates with our managed care partners. And whether that's a headwind or a tailwind remains to be determined.","Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And the 6%, it includes the commercial side?","David P. King","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This morning, Dave, you talked about an increase in payment from other payors when you answered Tom's question about positives. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing? We heard from your large competitor that they're actually seeing a decline and talked about a tough reimbursement environment. So if you can give us some color as to where you're seeing some opportunities to actually increase price. And is that actual increase in price? Or is it more of a mix issue that you're seeing?","David P. King","Lisa, it's Dave. Obviously, the Medicare reductions are a direct price headwind, so all of those go straight to price. As Brad commented earlier, we do have some price increases in other payor groups, which will help offset the payment reductions. And those consist of actual unit cost increases. And I'm not going to go to detail about those unit cost increases. But suffice to say, they go broadly across all of our other payor groups besides government. There also will be some benefit from test mix. And there will be some benefit from -- if history continues to repeat, some benefit from a slightly larger number of tests per requisition. So those are the pricing aspects of what we see in 2013 that will help us to offset to some extent the Medicare headwind.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just in your conversations with ACOs and some of the big IDNs that you talked about, as we see consolidation of health care, have you had those conversations around maybe narrower lab networks or being the lab provider of choice for any of these ACOs as we move forward?","David P. King","We have. I would say one of the complications is that the ACO environment is evolving quite rapidly. So you have many large ACOs forming that, that provide services to members of many different managed care plans. And so even being the preferred lab provider, obviously it doesn't mean you're going to get all of the volume. And most of those payment rates are going to be based on managed care contracts. I think over time as we see the evolution where ACOs and other providers are actually sharing or taking risk, that's when you'll start to see much more clarity on what the impact of that transition will be on pricing.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy, William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So I had a question on some commentary you made about Beacon and some of the alternative models that you're looking at pursuing. Is there a way to think about that sort of at a high level in terms of how that might impact the P&L relative to your core lab business? Is there -- would it be lower margin or higher revenue? I'm just trying to think about how that would flow through the P&L specifically.","David P. King","Amanda, it's Dave. I don't think we're in a position to talk about how Beacon might impact the P&L because there are so many different potential ways in which BeaconLBS could be deployed. So I think it's just too early to give a sense of what that would do from a revenue and a margin perspective.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then for the TC Grandfather, I recognize that's totally not a huge impact. But are there any lessons to be learned there in terms of how that may or may not have changed reimbursement just in terms of having to deal with a hospital directly versus what you were billing to a payor before?","David P. King","Well, I think it's -- I think it would be self-evident that the rates that we receive when we bill the government are really not negotiated rates. They're rates that are provided in the fee schedule. Anytime that we deal with nongovernment payors, we typically have a negotiation. So I don't know that there are any lessons to be learned. The TC Grandfather was a long-standing provision of law that Congress opted to change. And, again, I think it reflects a broader movement in the marketplace, where the government fee-for-service environment is migrating more towards either direct relationships with other payors or towards managed government beneficiaries and dealing with them in a managed rather than a fee-for-service environment.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes. I guess, I was -- the reason for the question was can we extrapolate anything from that to -- if the world moves more towards an ACO-type model, where the -- I guess, your customer becomes a provider versus the payor, is there anything that we can extrapolate from that experience? Or is it just too specific? That was really the point of the question, I suppose.","David P. King","I think that -- again, I think it's very early to try to think about what would happen as you move toward a more comprehensive, let's call it, ACO health system environment. But we negotiate with the payors, we negotiate with other providers who want to use our services. And I think that will continue to be, in 80% of our business, that will be the model. There will be negotiated rates of payment for services provided and for other services, like BeaconLBS or data analytics or population health management.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just one last one. You had mentioned something about having to reinvest in a testing platform. Could you just provide a little more color around what that is exactly?","David P. King","Yes. Without giving you a lot of specifics, we have a testing platform that had reached its -- the expiration of kind of its natural life and is not going to be supported anymore. It's a sizable platform and we have to replace the instruments basically in all of our laboratories.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Is that something to be -- from a risk standpoint, that could be an issue? Or is this just -- I'm sure you've counted [ph] these replacements before.","David P. King","Yes. I mean this is a 10-year-old system that just we need to upgrade. From a risk perspective, I don't think it entails an unusual amount of risk. We go through system replacements frequently and we do them on a rolling basis so that we don't disrupt workflow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich, Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Dave, just wanted to go back to the volume growth in Q4. How much growth are you guys getting from number of tests per requisition and mix shift to higher acuity tests? And also what about partnerships like with Ariosa Diagnostics? How much contribution did you guys see to the top line and volume from that?","David P. King","Kevin, it's Dave. I don't think it benefits us to break down every single component of volume growth. So I will say that test per requisition is a slight help on a comparative 2012 to 2011 basis, but it's not -- it doesn't change from 3Q to 4Q. We have gotten some nice top line growth from Ariosa, which is the noninvasive prenatal screening test. But, again, that's what we do. We introduce new tests that are scientifically innovative, cutting-edge and provide better, and in this case, less invasive patient care. And so it's our expectation that, that's part of our growth over time.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful, Dave. And then kind of going back to one of the earlier questions on ACOs. You talked about alternative delivery models in your prepared remarks. Just wondering how the discussions are going with hospitals and other providers. And any developments or updates from Adam's efforts since he's been with the company?","David P. King","Well, I think, Adam has been terrific. But Adam is part of a very large team of people at LabCorp, who are working on enhancing our hospital presence. And I'm not going to call the names of every single one of them on the call. But we have a very robust hospital business already, and everybody's working to grow it. I think we've had very constructive discussions with a number of health systems, about a broad range of relationships, going from reference testing to lab management to joint operating and joint equity ventures. And we will continue to push forward with that initiative. And I expect it to pay significant benefits as we come out of 2013 and go into 2014 in terms of revenue and volume growth.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last quick thing here, Dave. Brad talked about facility consolidation with the higher CapEx. I'm just wondering how much -- is that enough to move the needle with some of the operating costs? It looks like you've done a good job of keeping a tight lid on expenses as you always do. Just wondering how much more we could see in 2013.","David P. King","The facility consolidation, by its nature, is time-consuming. It's not just a question of moving a facility from one place to another because we have instrumentation, we have interfaces, we have to make sure that the customers are receiving the same level of service. So there is opportunity around facilities. And I put that into 2 categories. One is planned consolidations for acquisitions, where we know that over time we have a plan to reduce or consolidate space. And the other is a comprehensive review of our existing footprint and what are ways in which we can deploy it better. And this, the particular investment that we spoke about in facility consolidation, falls under the latter category, where we're looking at our existing footprint and we are consolidating, we will be consolidating multiple facilities into 1 facility during 2013. And we will continue to look at that. Again, very hard to put a specific cost number on it, Kevin. But what I would say is without a lot of fanfare around here, every year we reduce costs by $45 million, $50 million. And that's just part of our business, it's part of what we do and it's going to continue to be part of what we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice, UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions hopefully. Just first of all, I know you were giving that comment last quarter pretty early, and I applaud you for just even making a guess at it. But you said $0.22 last quarter for the Medicare headwind, and now it's $0.35. And I just was trying to understand what is the clarification or the change in thinking that happened that resulted in the $0.35.","William B. Hayes","A.J., this is Brad. I think the major difference as we look at the $0.22 from Q3 and the $0.35 that we've updated now for our 2013 outlook is the 88305, which we did not know about at the time. The full impact -- the full year impact of the TC Grandfather change, which we did not consider in the $0.22 and a few other changes that are related to all the government changes and reductions in payment, and that is the difference.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then another, a sort of broader question on the pricing trend. Is there anything -- when you step back and look at the aggregate business, payor mix, is that the places -- the different sources of payors? Is that changing and having an impact on pricing if you look at '12 versus '11 and maybe your expectation for '13?","William B. Hayes","A.J., it's Brad again. The biggest change I can think of that we see in that is mostly as a result of acquisition. So if I think about MEDTOX, for example, that's hitting in the client or direct to the company sort of billing, which is typically lower nature in price. I think beyond that, and some of the other things that we've done in the past few years, clinical trials-related, are also showing up in that same area. If I take those things away, I don't see a major shift going on between the payor mix schedules, especially on a year-over-year basis. We can see some variations in quarters and sequential views and things of that nature, but no real change in -- dramatic change in capitation or managed care fee-for-service patient, the other categories that come to mind.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's good. And then just a last question on -- I appreciate the comments on health reform. I wondered specifically about the exchanges. Do your contracts with commercial payors' managed care today date just automatically apply to those people that are on the exchanges? Or do you have to go out and negotiate new contracts for those new health plans that -- maybe with payors you have current contracts with? And if so, have you had any early discussions and any sense that the exchange-related patients may get  -- may be priced somehow differently or set up differently?","David P. King","A.J., it's Dave. It's a great question, and I wish there were a clear answer that we could give you. I think the way that the exchanges are going to operate is still very unclear. And so we have had many conversations with our managed care partners about how the exchanges are going to work. And I think they are as uncertain as we are. So I think that the best we can give you is we're in frequent and detailed discussions. But it's not clear what the outcome will be from a pricing or an offering perspective.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to just ask a couple of things here. First, as it relates to buyback, I understand you're not going to guide us on the cadence of your buyback, et cetera. But just curious just given the size of it, will -- should we expect anything different as it relates to how you approach it? In other words, historically, we've seen more opportunistic buybacks in the quarter. Do you think you might do some larger, fuller purchase agreements? Just structurally, how are you thinking about the buyback, given the size that you've announced here?","David P. King","Darren, it's Dave. I think the share buyback has been an extremely important way of returning capital to shareholders. And I think, over time, we've done a very good job of doing it in a disciplined way that has created a lot of value. That's our goal. That's what we're going to continue to do. Beyond that, we are not going to guide to how we're going to do it structurally or otherwise other than to say that this is the way we return capital to shareholders, we're committed to it and we're going to continue to do that.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sure. Okay, that's fair. And then I guess, just on the cash flow outlook. Brad, it seems like you maybe pull a little bit more of working capital from the 2012 period. It sounded like maybe this inventory build around some vendor discounts that you got. I'm curious just why the cash flow outlook for '12 -- or '13 rather, wouldn't reverse that. Is there anything else in working capital that we ought to be thinking about for '13?","William B. Hayes","Not specifically in working capital. I mean, I think about the other things related to earnings that we talked about. The payment reductions are obviously a headwind for the cash flow. And then just generally speaking, the growth environment. I think again back to our comments of most of the growth driven by the MEDTOX acquisition in '13 that's in our range, I think it's just the muted earnings growth environment and the payment reductions are the only thing that come to mind specifically and nothing really in the other areas of working capital.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just so I'm clear. Severance and other restructuring is excluded from that outlook or contemplated in it?","William B. Hayes","It's excluded from both the EPS, so we don't project in our guidance at all any sort of restructuring activities. And therefore, it's also not considered for the cash flow guidance either.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But given some of the ongoing nature of what you're describing in terms of cost reductions and consolidations, what would be a rough cash impact from that in '13, any range you'd put on it?","William B. Hayes","No, I wouldn't want to estimate it because again it has a lot of things that it depends on as we execute on these things.","Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just last thing is really around margins and what's sort of baked into your guidance. Implicitly it does assume margin improvement, just if you take midpoints and walk it up from the EPS line. I guess, Dave, you made the comment that you're taking $50 million of costs out per year, and you've already commented about some managed care pricing that you'll be able to benefit from. I guess, just given the environment and the growth of what we're seeing here, is there anything else that we ought to be considering in terms of your margin outlook that would get us to an improvement, my math, close to 1 point of year-over-year improvement in margin?","David P. King","Obviously, the major swing factors, Darren, on margin are volume, price and expenses. So how we do on volume will have an impact on where we end up in the margin range. The pricing that we believe that we will encounter in 2013 have an impact on that margin range. And the facility consolidation, the cost reductions that we've talked about, and of course, other cost reductions that we do on a regular basis, those are the 3 major factors. But I don't -- and I guess, actually the fourth thing is just the continued integration of acquisitions and the ability to reduce costs in MEDTOX and continue to reduce the cost base in Genzyme. Those are the major things that are incorporated in the guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just maybe wanted to touch on the organic volume trend this quarter when you adjust for Sandy. Was there anything else in there? You mentioned flu being sort of not that important. But maybe deductibles are another item there that helped the business sequentially?","David P. King","No, I think what helped the business sequentially is that more people came to our patient service centers. I mean, we had a -- in our view, we had a strong organic volume growth in a quarter that typically is not one of our stronger growth quarters. So we're pleased with it. And I don't know that there's anything we can do to kind of break it down into bits and pieces.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the testing platform switch there. Is there an opportunity for you guys to maybe get better pricing terms or upgrade the technology you are using in a material way? And I'm just trying to put that into context as to how important that is for the overall business, how sizable it is.","David P. King","There's a -- whenever we switch out a testing platform, it is to improve technology. And in almost every case, it's to reduce expenses. And so in this case, the change in the testing platform will have both impacts, although obviously there is a capital component that comes back as an expense once it's deployed into service.","William B. Hayes","And Isaac, this is Brad. I would add that because of our standardization and the way we go about this from a supply chain perspective, we do the whole network at one time, not on the same day but we make the decision, and it applies to the entire network. It takes some time to roll it out. But we think by approaching it that way, we are able to get the best economics on those kinds of activities.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And can you maybe offer some color as to what type of a testing platform it is. Is it routine testing or molecular? I'm just trying to get a sense of how important this is to the business mix.","David P. King","No, we're not going to give any color on what platform it is.","So it's 10:00, and I'm going to -- we're going to try to take a couple more questions. But let us please try to limit it to 1 question so that everybody has a chance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if I could just maybe follow up on that previous sort of EBIT question. It kind of feels like if I look over the last 6 months, your operating profit was shrinking a little bit by about maybe 3% sort of year-over-year in the second half of '12, if I normalize for Sandy. And then if I kind of take into account what you're telling us in terms of guidance, it feels like you're looking for a 1% to 2% increase in your operating profit this year. And Dave, I heard you just talk about the drivers. Maybe if you can give us a little bit more clarity about what you think you can do on the expense reduction side, so we can maybe back into kind of what you're implying in terms of vols and pricing?","William B. Hayes","Glen, it's Brad. Are you talking about absolute dollars or on a margin basis?","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On a dollars basis.","William B. Hayes","Okay. Because I can see that, but I couldn't get to on the margin side what your question was.","David P. King","So Glen, it's Dave. I think, as I've mentioned and I'm not sure that I can say it in a different way from what I've said before, we have some opportunities around the acquisition integration. We have some opportunities around the consolidation of facilities. And we always are working on cost reductions across the organization, with SG&A this year being a prime example. So I can't really give you much more than what I've said before, which is these are the expense opportunities and the expense reduction opportunities that we're always looking at.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. Maybe if I could just ask one quick one on the anatomic pathology side. You talked about obviously the major cut in your sort of prepared remarks. Could you give us your updated view maybe on this trend of physician in-sourcing of these tests? Do you see it moderating at all? Or with the reimbursement cut, do you think it reverses over time this trend?","David P. King","I do think that the reduction in the technical component of 88305 will discourage physician in-sourcing because it becomes considerably less of a profit center. But again the impact, the reduction only occurred on January 1, so it's really too early to call it a trend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dane Leone from Macquarie.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","A quick one for me. You kind of always highlight some new tests that you have in the pipeline in your the outlook. I think it would be helpful if you could just give some color going into '13 on expectations for new products to add to the growth of the franchise. I know you don't really break it out specifically. But any type of characterization you can give this year versus last year, any real impact towards the growth of the esoteric mix overall would be helpful.","David P. King","Yes. I think the Ariosa test will be a significant contributor, the noninvasive prenatal screening test. I think that we're going to continue to see some growth in specialized testing around hepatitis C as more of these compounds are successful and come to market and there are tests associated with the efficacy of the new compounds. I think that the next-generation sequencing and the cardio seq will continue to grow. I also think that even though it would not be described by itself as esoteric, I think that the chronic kidney, the cardiovascular, the bone, all of the services that we've launched through Litholink that help physicians manage patients will continue to see nice growth there. So there are a lot of things that obviously I have not mentioned, but those are probably some of the highlights for where we think we'll see growth in new tests in 2013.","Dane Leone - Macquarie Research","Okay. And for context, is there a hurdle rate where you'd consider something an impactful contributor, generally speaking, of a new test or growth of a test?","David P. King","I think the reality is that most tests -- most new tests that we introduce are relatively specialized and meet needs of a certain physician community or a certain part of the clinical community. So for us, the hurdle rate is, is there an unmet need in the population, is this something that's going to be helpful to clinicians, will it give us the ability to better diagnose and treat disease? Obviously, we want to be financially successful with these tests, but it would be unrealistic to say there has to be a financial hurdle rate for everything that we launch.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to David King for closing remarks.","David P. King","Thank you, Sean. Thank you, everyone, for attending our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Call today, and we hope you have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day."]}}
